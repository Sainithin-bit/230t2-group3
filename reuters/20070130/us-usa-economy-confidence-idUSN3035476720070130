 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. consumers' mood brightened slightly in January on a more favorable view of the labor market, a survey showed on Tuesday. 


 The Conference Board said its index of consumer sentiment rose to 110.3 in January from an upwardly revised 110.0 in December, originally reported as 109.0. Economists polled by Reuters on average had forecast a January reading of 110.0. The January index, which matched that of May 2002, was the highest since March 2002, when it read 110.7, said Lynn Franco, director of the Conference Board Consumer Research Center. "This month's slightest increase in confidence was solely the result of an improvement in the Present Situation Index, fueled primarily by a more favorable job market," Franco said. "Consumers are not as optimistic as they were in December. All in all, the Index suggests a moderate improvement in the pace of growth in early 2007," Franco said. Consumers' assessment of current conditions was more favorable than in December. The business research group's present situation index rose to 133.9 in January from a revised 130.5 in December. The expectations index fell to 94.5 in January from a revised 96.3 in December. Consumers had a positive view of the labor market. Those surveyed who said jobs were "plentiful" increased to 29.9 percent in January from a revised 27.6 percent in December. Those saying jobs were "hard to get" declined to 19.7 percent from a revised 21.3 percent in December. The report came close to expectations, leading to a muted market reaction. U.S. Treasury debt prices US10YT=RR were steady at higher levels after the data. The euro and the dollar  EUR=  were also little changed after the report as investors focused on a two-day Federal Reserve monetary policy meeting which starts on Tuesday afternoon. "The confidence number is taking a back seat to the Fed meeting. The market is basically on Fed watch right now," said Omer Esiner, market analyst at Ruesch International in Washington, D.C. Sentiment indexes have traditionally been seen as a gauge of U.S. consumer spending, which accounts for roughly two-thirds of overall economic activity. The latest reports on U.S. chain store sales were mixed but showed year-on-year growth. The International Council of Shopping Centers and UBS Securities on Tuesday said chain store sales fell 0.9 percent in the January 27 week after rising 0.1 percent the prior week but rose 4.9 percent on a year-on-year basis. Redbook Research on Tuesday said chain store sales rose 2.7 percent in the week ended January 27 versus the year ago and increased 1.6 percent January-to-date versus December.
