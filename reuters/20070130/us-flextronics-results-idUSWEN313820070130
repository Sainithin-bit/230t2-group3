 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Flextronics ( FLEX.O ), the world's largest contract electronics manufacturer, on Tuesday posted a jump in quarterly profit from a year ago, when results were weighed down by charges. 


 Shares of Flextronics rose 2.6 percent to $11.72 in extended trade, after rising 1.3 percent to close at $11.40 on Nasdaq. Flextronics' per-share profit excluding items topped analyst expectations by a penny. Chief Financial Officer Thomas Smach said that Flextronics had a strong quarter across the board, noting in an interview that "every single market segment was up." "Definitely handsets were better than expected," Smach said, adding that handset revenue rose 53 percent year over year. Revenue in the company's infrastructure segment climbed 26 percent, consumer revenue rose 18 percent, and computing was up 4 percent. Revenue from industrial, automotive and medical advanced 48 percent, Smach said. Net income in its fiscal third quarter rose to $119 million, or 20 cents per share, from $42.0 million, or 7 cents per share, a year ago. Revenue rose to $5.42 billion from $4.13 billion. Excluding items, Flextronics said it had a third-quarter per-share profit of 23 cents. Analysts expected a profit before items of 22 cents per share, on revenue of $5.22 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. For the current quarter, Flextronics said it sees net earnings per share of 20 cents on revenue of $4.8 billion. The company said the per-share figure includes about 3 cents a share in intangible amortization and stock-based compensation expense. In the holiday-sales-fueled December quarter, Flextronics benefited from solid sales of mobile phones, which account for about 30 percent of its revenue. Shares of Flextronics rose 10 percent in 2006, compared with an 11 percent increase in the Merrill Lynch Technology 100 Index, of which Flextronics is a member, in the same time period.
