 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Kellogg Co. ( K.N ) reported lower fourth-quarter earnings on Tuesday due to costs for job cuts at a plant in England, higher prices for commodities such as corn and wheat, and increased advertising spending. 


 The world's largest breakfast cereal maker also said it expects corn prices to remain volatile for the foreseeable future amid increased use of the crop in making ethanol, a fuel additive. "There is certainly a correlation between the price of corn and the large push on ethanol. And in our view, that is unlikely to change dramatically in the near term," David Mackay, chief executive officer, said in an interview. But the company still raised its 2007 earnings forecast by a penny on expectations that "internal" sales, which exclude currency fluctuations and other factors, will increase more than long-term targets. Fourth-quarter net income fell to $182.4 million, or 45 cents per share, from $192.4 million, or 47 cents per share, a year earlier. Analysts' average profit forecast was 47 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Kellogg shares were down about 1 percent in midday trade on the New York Stock Exchange. "As we look to 2007, commodity costs remain a concern, given high grain costs and Kellogg's grain-heavy portfolio, so we still expect significant inflation going forward," Christopher Growe, an analyst at A.G. Edwards, said in a research note. "Still, we see modest gross margin improvement (particularly later in the year), with modest price increases in U.S. cereal carrying into next year." The latest quarter included 8 cents a share in restructuring costs, which the company said was significantly greater than in the year-earlier period. In September, Kellogg said it would cut jobs at a facility in Manchester, England. SALES CLIMB Quarterly sales rose 8 percent to $2.58 billion. Analysts on average forecast $2.53 billion. Internal sales rose 6 percent. North American internal cereal sales fell 2 percent, compared with an 8 percent increase last year, as retailers reduced inventories. Overall sales in North America were up 7 percent, while international sales rose 6 percent. Kellogg, which also makes Keebler cookies and Pop-Tarts toaster pastries, has benefited in recent years from a steady stream of higher-priced products such as new varieties of cereals Special K and All Bran. But like many U.S. food makers, Kellogg has also suffered from higher commodity costs. To help offset cost increases, the company raised cereal prices last year. Higher commodity, fuel, energy and employee benefit costs cut gross margins by 1.6 percentage points in the fourth quarter, the company said. Kellogg raised its 2007 earnings forecast to a range of $2.68 to $2.73 a share from its previous forecast of $2.67 to $2.72. Analysts on average forecast $2.75. The company said it includes restructuring costs in its forecasts, while some analysts do not. Kellogg expects increased fuel, energy, commodity and benefits costs to cut earnings by 18 cents to 22 cents a share this year. The company confirmed its forecast for a decrease in operating profit in the first quarter due to higher commodity costs and advertising spending. Kellogg shares were down 45 cents at $50.36 at midday on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock trades at about 20 times estimated 2007 earnings, compared with a multiple of 18 for rival General Mills Inc. ( GIS.N ). (Additional reporting by  Nichola Groom )
