 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Diversified manufacturer 3M Co. ( MMM.N ) posted a weaker-than-expected quarterly profit on Tuesday and said global economic growth was slowing, sending its shares down 4.7 percent and weighing heavily on blue chip stocks overall. 


 The maker of such products as Scotch tape, Post-It notes, Thinsulate insulation and a host of other items also forecast a 2007 profit below expectations. In giving the outlook for this year, Chief Executive George Buckley cited "slightly moderating economic growth worldwide." "I see a year of plenty of challenges ... but none that will steer us off our long-term course," Buckley told analysts on a conference call. 3M's earnings growth would be slow in the first quarter, pick up in the second quarter and accelerate in the second half of the year, he added. 3M executives cited the U.S. housing market as a drag, resulting in lower demand for products ranging from its optical films used in liquid crystal display televisions to roofing granules used in shingles for houses. The slowdown in the latter alone cost the company 5 cents a share in earnings over the second half of the year, Buckley said. Investors have worried about a slowdown in the U.S. economy and look to companies like 3M for clues to the future. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  was up slightly on Tuesday, but 3M subtracted about almost 30 points from the index. Another diversified manufacturer, Illinois Tool Works Inc. ( ITW.N ), had previously cut its outlook and Tuesday pointed to moderating demand and even declines in some of its North American markets, specifically citing the housing sector and production by the Big 3 domestic automakers. 3M's net income in the fourth quarter rose 58 percent to $1.2 billion, or $1.57 a share, from $746 million, or 97 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding a $354 million gain, largely from the sale of its branded drug business, it earned $1.10 a share. That was 4 cents below what analysts polled by Reuters Estimates had expected. "The 3M fourth quarter was an across-the-board miss, with an overwhelming degree of moving parts, the impact of which were poorly communicated by the company prior to the release," JP Morgan analyst Stephen Tusa said in a research note. Tusa, who has an "overweight" rating on 3M's stock, said the shortfall in the company's display and graphics business, which includes the closely followed optical films unit, was bigger than expected. The company said on the conference call that demand in that business was "moderating" toward the end of December. In October, 3M, considered a bellwether for the U.S. economy because of its extensive product portfolio, had forecast a profit, excluding one-time items, of $1.10 to $1.16 a share. Sales rose 8.6 percent from last year to $5.78 billion, slightly above Wall Street's expectations. Sales in local currencies grew 5.8 percent. It had previously forecast growth of 4 percent to 8 percent. Overall volume growth in the quarter was 6.8 percent, with growth in ongoing businesses at 4.9 percent. However, pricing fell 1 percent, dragged down by declines overseas. 3M, based in St. Paul, Minnesota, expects 2007 earnings in the range of $5.20 to $5.45 a share, including a net gain for restructuring actions of about 60 to 70 cents a share. Excluding one-time items, it sees a profit of $4.60 to $4.75 a share, below the $5 analysts were expecting. It expects full-year local-currency sales growth, adjusted for the divestiture of the branded drug business, of 6 percent to 10 percent. That includes about 1.5 percentage points for acquisitions. Including the drug sales in 2006, it expects sales growth this year of 2 percent to 6 percent. After falling as low as $74.26, 3M shares were off $3.65, at $75.31 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. (Additional reporting by Christopher Kaufman)
