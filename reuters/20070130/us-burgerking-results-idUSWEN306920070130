 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Burger King Holdings Inc. BKC.N, the world's second-largest hamburger chain, on Tuesday reported higher quarterly earnings as an Xbox 360 video game promotion spurred sales in the United States. 


 Net income for the fiscal second quarter was $38 million, or 28 cents per share, compared with $27 million, or 24 cents per share, a year ago. Wall Street analysts, on average, had been expecting the newly public company to earn 26 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates.
