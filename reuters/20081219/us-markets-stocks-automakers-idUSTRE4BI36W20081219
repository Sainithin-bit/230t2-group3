 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Shares of General Motors Corp ( GM.N ) and Ford Motor Co ( F.N ) rose before the opening bell on Friday after a senior U.S. official said the White House would make available loans from the Troubled Asset Relief Program to ailing auto manufacturers. 

 Loans of $17.4 billion will be given out, of which the last $4 billion will be contingent on a second drawdown of the TARP. GM stock rose 7.9 percent to $3.95 and Ford rose 6.7 percent to $3.03. (Reporting by  Deepa Seetharaman ; Editing by  James Dalgleish )
