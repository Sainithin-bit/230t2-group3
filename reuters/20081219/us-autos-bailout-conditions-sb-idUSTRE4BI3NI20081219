 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Automakers would have through March to restructure into viable companies outside of bankruptcy under terms of a U.S. government bailout announced on Friday. 

 Companies must provide warrants for nonvoting stock, and debt owed to the government would be senior to other debts, to the extent permitted by law. Companies must allow the government to examine their books and records. Negotiable targets include cutting debt by two-thirds via equity exchange, making half of company contributions to retiree health care trusts in stock, and making wages competitive with foreign manufacturers by December 2009.
