 ZURICH  (Reuters) - Managed accounts -- seen as a way to give investors clarity on fund strategy and protection from fraud -- may have failed on both counts in the Madoff debacle and lessons will have to be learned, industry insiders said. 

 Investors will sometimes choose to access a fund or a fund manager via a managed account, which in theory allows them to replicate the underlying strategy while maintaining a measure of control by appointing their own custodian. The assets will generally be segregated from those of other investors. Yet it appears that even those Madoff investors who sought safety through managed accounts have lost out because these accounts were instead run through Madoff's own trading house, Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC. Firms controlled by Madoff were therefore responsible for providing clients with trading histories and net asset values which have now been revealed as fabrications. Jerome de Lavenere Lussan, managing partner of investment management consultancy Laven Partners, said investors had left themselves open to risk. "If you are leaving the custody and administration to the money manager, then that is who provides the trading and position data, which can therefore be manipulated," he said. David Butler, a founding member of Kinetic Partners, a professional services company which advises asset managers including hedge funds, said: "For managed accounts, adequate custody arrangements would normally entail a custodian who is independent of the fund manager." Lussan added that in normal circumstances "the fund manager controls the account but the client's bank or custodian may conduct administration and periodically provide the client with the net value of the assets." LOSSES Earlier this week Bloomberg reported that those holding managed accounts with Madoff included Swiss private bank Union Bancaire Privee, which has said client losses may be up to $1 billion. Clients at several other private banks are reported to have lost money via managed accounts. Since the scandal first broke, many investors have noted that, when asked how he was able to outperform peers, Madoff would smile wryly but evade the question. Even so, investors continued to give him their money. One crucial factor was that Madoff did not charge fees to investors and third party distributors who channeled money into his fund -- provided he allowed them to invest with him at all. Investors believed that Madoff was getting his own return from brokerage fees alone. With investors lining up to give him money, he had no reason to allow access to his funds to investors unwilling to work through his brokerage. It was a clever ruse, whereby Madoff succeeded in convincing investors to hand control of their assets to him -- indeed they were eager to do so -- without his even having to ask for it. They may be more circumspect next time. "One lesson from the Madoff affair is that managed account holders should use a broker dealer of their own choice to hold the assets," says Juerg Buehler, founding partner, Zurich-based Dynamite F3, fund which invests in funds of hedge funds. Lussan added, in a warning to both investors and advisers: "If the due diligence process extends only to fund structure, not to the underlying processes and investments, you have not done a complete job and could be liable to the consequences." New York-based hedge fund manager Bernard Madoff was arrested last Thursday and charged with running a huge "Ponzi" scheme which paid profits to early investors from the investments made by later entrants.
