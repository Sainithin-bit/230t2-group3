 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - General Motors will receive $13.4 billion and Chrysler LLC will get $4 billion of the government auto loans announced on Friday, a White House official said. 

 Ford does not believe it needs a loan at this time, Joel Kaplan, White House deputy chief of staff, said. The loans are for the auto manufacturers and not the company's financing arms, he said. But government discussions with the financing arms are ongoing, Kaplan said. (Reporting by  Tabassum Zakaria ; Editing by  Eric Beech )
