 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - President-elect Barack Obama said on Friday that he wants to be sure that new jobs are created in the U.S. auto industry and that it survives not for a few months but for years to come. 

 "My top priority in this administration is to create 2.5 million new jobs and I want some of those jobs to be in the auto industry," Obama said at a news conference. He declined to say what, if any, changes he would make to the $17.4 billion auto bailout plan announced by the White House on Friday, but he said his economic team would discuss with the industry and workers ways to ensure their survival. "I just want to make sure that when we see a final restructuring package, that it's not just workers who are bearing the brunt of that restructuring," Obama said. "All shareholders are going to have to play a part in this process."
