 TOKYO  (Reuters) - The Nikkei average fell 1.1 percent on Friday in cautious trade ahead of a decision on interest rates by the Bank of Japan, with Toyota Motor ( 7203.T ) retreating after a newspaper report warned about an annual operating loss. 

 Oil-related shares such as Inpex Corp ( 1605.T ) slid after U.S. crude oil prices dropped sharply, but drugmaker Daiichi Sankyo Co Ltd ( 4568.T ) jumped after European regulators recommended its new blood clot preventer prasugrel for approval. Trade was choppy with the benchmark moving in and out of positive territory throughout morning trade. "The number of participants is limited, making the market volatile, as investors want to see if the BOJ will cut interest rates, and due to a lack of trading factors and the holiday season," said Takahiko Murai, general manager of equities at Nozomi Securities. "The index will likely move in a narrow range unless currencies start moving drastically or some big news emerges from the United States." The Nikkei  .N225  shed 94.95 points to 8,572.28 and the broader Topix  .TOPX  dipped 0.4 percent to 835.53. The Fed's dramatic rate cut has raised the pressure on a reluctant BOJ to follow suit at its two-day policy review ending on Friday. U.S. interest rates are now below Japanese rates for the first time since February 1993. TOYOTA SLIPS, DAIICHI SANKYO JUMPS Toyota shares shed 1 percent to 2,930 yen after the Nikkei financial daily said the world's biggest automaker was likely to report its first-ever operating loss in the year ending March 31 due to plunging sales and the strength of the yen. Other media said, however, that Toyota may manage to post an operating profit on a consolidated basis although it would likely book a loss on a parent-only basis. "Toyota shares had already been sold off, but the market will likely start pricing in the possibility that next year will be even worse, preventing the stock price from going above 3,000 yen in the short-term," said Murai at Nozomi Securities. Rival Honda Motor Co Ltd ( 7267.T ) shed 0.9 percent to 1,808 yen. Japan's second biggest automaker cut its annual operating profit forecast by two-thirds this week due to a firmer yen and dropping sales. Oil and gas field developer Inpex tumbled 7.2 percent to 578,000 yen after hitting crude oil hit its lowest since June 2004 as slumping demand and swelling U.S. inventories offset OPEC's record supply cut agreement. Showa Shell Sekiyu ( 5002.T ) slid 2 percent to 836 yen and Nippon Oil Corp 5001.T lost 3.6 percent to 402 yen. Trading houses also fell as they are major dealers in energy and have stakes in oil and gas projects. Mitsubishi Corp ( 8058.T ), Japan's largest trading house, dropped 2.7 percent to 1,173 yen. Shares of Daiichi Sankyo ( 4568.T ) jumped 5.1 percent to 2,010 yen after prasugrel developed by the Japan's No. 3 drugmaker and Eli Lilly & Co, won a major endorsement from international regulators on Thursday when the European Medicines Agency recommended its approval. Banking shares rose, with Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group ( 8306.T ), Japan's biggest bank, up 2.2 percent at 554 yen and No.2 Mizuho Financial Group ( 8411.T ) adding 0.9 percent to 259,000 yen. "Investors picked up stocks of banks or real estate firms because they expect to see some financial measures from the Bank of Japan," said Tsuyoshi Segawa, an equity strategist at Shinko Securities. Trade was light on the Tokyo exchange's first section, with 853 million shares changing hands, compared with last week's morning average of 1 billion. Declining stocks outpaced advancing ones by more than 2 to 1. (Reporting by Aiko Hayashi; Editing by  Edwina Gibbs )
