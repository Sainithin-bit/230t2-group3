 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - General Motors and Chrysler LLC have signed loan agreements with the U.S. government that will provide the struggling automakers with up to $17.4 billion, White House spokesman Tony Fratto said on Friday. 

 "Yes," he told Reuters when asked if the agreements had been signed. Earlier on Friday, a White House official said the loans were not yet signed because the parties were going over technical elements of the agreements. (Reporting by  Jeremy Pelofsky , editing by Doina Chiacu)
