 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - President-elect Barack Obama said on Friday that the White House move to rescue Detroit's automakers was a "necessary step" to avoid an industry collapse that would have had dire consequences for the economy. 

 In a step aimed at saving the faltering companies, President George W. Bush $17.4 billion in emergency loans to the carmakers. "Today's actions are a necessary step to help avoid a collapse in our auto industry that would have devastating consequences for our economy and our workers," Obama said in a statement.
