 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Bonds of General Motors Corp and Ford Motor Co rose on Friday as a rescue plan to provide $17.4 billion in loans to ailing automakers came together. 

 GM's 8.375 percent bonds due in 2033 rose to 18.6 cents on the dollar, up about 3 cents. Ford Motor Co's 7.45 percent bonds due in 2031 rose to 27 cents, up about 2 cents. President George W. Bush on Friday said the government will provide U.S. automakers financial aid while they implement plans to restructure because otherwise their collapse could send the economy into a deeper and longer recession.
