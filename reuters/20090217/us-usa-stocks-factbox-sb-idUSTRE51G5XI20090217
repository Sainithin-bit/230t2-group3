 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures slid more than 3 percent before the bell on Tuesday, making it unlikely that the stock market would mount a late-hour rebound. 

 Data from market research firm Birinyi Associates shows that the pre-market slide marked the fourth time since 1993 that a 3 percent slide in stock futures has been followed by more selling at 10 a.m. EST. Regular trade begins at 9:30 a.m. Below is the Dow industrial's performance on days when stock index futures fell 3 percent. On average the market is down an additional 1 percent from 10 a.m. to the close: Date          Futures        Prv  Close -10 a.m.           10 a.m. -Close 9/21/01     -3.41 pct     -3.09 pct                                 +1.46 pct 10/22/08    -2.73 pct     -3.94 pct                                -1.83 pct 10/24/08     -6.61 pct    -3.69 pct                               +0.10 pct 12/1/08       -2.91 pct     -4.08 pct                                -3.72 pct Average    -3.92 pct      -3.70 pct                                 -1.00 Source - Birinyi Associates (Reporting by  Ellis Mnyandu )
