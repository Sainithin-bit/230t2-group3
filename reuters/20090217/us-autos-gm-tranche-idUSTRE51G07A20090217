 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The U.S. government will release $4 billion in additional aid to General Motors Corp ( GM.N ) on Tuesday as planned, a White House aide said on Monday, ahead of the deadline for the automaker to submit a new survival plan. 

 The aide said GM's smaller rival Chrysler LLC's request for additional aid would be treated as a new request and dealt with separately. GM is seeking concessions from the United Auto Workers union and creditors under the terms of its $13.4 billion federal bailout. It must submit a restructuring plan to U.S. officials on Tuesday showing how it can cut costs and pay back the loans. President Barack Obama has decided to launch a government task force for restructuring the U.S. auto industry instead of naming a "car czar" with sweeping powers. He is appointing Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner as his "designee" for overseeing auto bailout loans and as co-head of the new high-level panel together with White House economic adviser Lawrence Summers, a senior administration official said on Sunday. To date, GM has received $9.4 billion in federal aid that has allowed it to stay in operation since the start of the year. It is widely expected to seek additional assistance with the restructuring plan due Tuesday. Chrysler, controlled by Cerberus Capital Management, has been granted $4 billion in federal and is seeking an additional $3 billion. (Reporting by  Jeff Mason ; editing by  Todd Eastham )
