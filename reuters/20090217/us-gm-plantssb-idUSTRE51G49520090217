 HAMBURG, Germany  (Reuters) - U.S. carmaker General Motors is trying to preserve its plants in Germany as it cuts costs to address slumping demand, a senior labor leader said amid reports GM could close three or more plants in Europe. 

 "I have been assured by members of GM management and the supervisory board that they will do their utmost to save the German plants," said Rainer Einenkel, head of the works council at the GM plant in the western German city of Bochum. GM's top labor leader in Europe, Klaus Franz, said he was unaware of any plans to close GM plants in Europe. German Economy Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg told reporters the government was awaiting details of a reorganization plan GM was due to present the U.S. government later on Tuesday before deciding "whether and how we can help." "Talks will take place in the days and weeks ahead but first we need conceptual clarity," he added. The Automotive News Europe paper and Bloomberg news agency have reported GM could close down European plants as part of its campaign to show how it was using billions of dollars in U.S. government loans to turn itself around. GM officials in Europe had no comment on the reports. "There are at least three plants seriously in question," Automotive News Europe quoted an unidentified person familiar with the matter as saying. It cited industry insiders as saying the factories most likely at risk were in Antwerp, Belgium; Ellesmere Port, England; and at least one of its four plants in Germany. Bloomberg cited an unidentified source as saying the Antwerp and Bochum plants could be closed and a factory in the eastern German town of Eisenach may be sold in addition to selling or closing a Saab plant in Trollhattan, Sweden.
