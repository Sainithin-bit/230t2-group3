 ST JOHN'S (Reuters) - The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) has suspended sponsorship negotiations with Allen Stanford following fraud allegations against him in the U.S., the ECB said on Tuesday. 

 "Following allegations made today (Tuesday) by the US Securities and Exchange Commission and their decision to apply for a temporary restraining order which was filed in a Dallas/Fort Worth court, the England and Wales Cricket Board and the West Indies Cricket Board have suspended negotiations with Sir Allen Stanford and his financial corporation concerning a new sponsorship deal," said an ECB statement.
