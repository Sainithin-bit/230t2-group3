 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Manufacturing production in New York State fell to a record low in February, intensifying a factory slump gripping the recession-bound economy, according to a survey released on Tuesday from the regional central bank. 

 KEY POINTS: * he New York Federal Reserve's Empire State factory index fell to minus 34.65 -- the lowest in the history of the index, which dates back to July 2001. * It was down from January's already contractionary reading of minus 22.20. * Economists had expected a reading of minus 24, according to the median of their 46 forecasts, which ranged from minus 36.5 to negative 17.50. * Reflecting a bleak outlook, the survey's gauge of new orders fell to an all-time low of minus 30.51 from January's negative 22.81. * The survey showed prices continued to fall, while employment in the state's factory sector was depressed. * The employment gauge fell to 39.08 in February -- the lowest since November 2001 -- from January's 26.14. COMMENTS: IAN LYNGEN, INTEREST RATE STRATEGIST, RBS GREENWICH CAPITAL, GREENWICH, CONNECTICUT: The Empire State reading "dropped to -34.65, the lowest on record since 2001, but more importantly showing an acceleration of the pace of declines. "Employment also declined further....Overall a weak report illustrating a quickening pace of declines in February. The Treasury market has held on to its overnight strength."
