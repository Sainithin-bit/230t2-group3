 DENVER, Colo.  (Reuters) - The White House said it was crucial for the United States to have a strong and viable auto industry, and it would study the survival plans of General Motors Corp and Chrysler LLC due to be submitted on Tuesday. 

 General Motors and Chrysler were putting the finishing touches on Tuesday to restructuring plans that will outline aggressive cost-cutting in exchange for a multi-billion dollar government bailout. Pressed on whether a government-managed bankruptcy may be needed to deal with the companies' woes, White House spokesman Robert Gibbs told reporters traveling on Air Force One that he would not prejudge what measures might be needed for the industry. But, he said: "To have a strong and viable auto industry is tremendously important for the future." (Reporting by  Caren Bohan )
