 HOUSTON  (Reuters) - Stanford Financial Group is now "under the management of a receiver," according to a sign taped to the window of the firm's Houston headquarters on Tuesday, a Reuters eyewitness said. 

 "We are temporarily closed. The company is still in operation but under the management of a receiver," the sign said, the eyewitness said. (Reporting by  Anna Driver , editing by Maureen Bavdek)
