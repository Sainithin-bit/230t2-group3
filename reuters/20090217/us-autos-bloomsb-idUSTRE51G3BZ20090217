 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Ron Bloom, named to an Obama administration team to help overhaul the U.S. auto industry, is a seasoned labor negotiator who can close a deal with Wall Street financiers but help get workers facing a horrible reality something for their sacrifice. 

 Bloom has been the point man for the United Steelworkers Union during industry restructuring in the 1990s and this decade. He has dealt first hand with the type of painful possibilities now facing Detroit automakers, including contraction, bankruptcy and changes to labor contracts. Bloom, a former investment banker with Lazard Freres, also has helped work out mergers and innovative in-house approaches that can give breath to companies when times are bad and make an industry better able to compete with more nimble rivals. His appointment as a senior Treasury Department adviser appears central to the government's effort to facilitate, not force, change by bridging gaps, projecting credibility and trust, and understanding complex issues. Bloom also serves as a counterweight for labor to the administration's decision to retain law firms with bankruptcy experience to advise Treasury officials on GM and Chrysler. White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said Bloom has "some real expertise" on matters relating to investors -- including bondholders -- but also is mindful of the "livelihoods of tens of thousands of autoworkers in the Midwest who need to have a seat at the table as well." For instance, Bloom brings unique perspective on a hot-button issue for the UAW in its current negotiations with General Motors Corp and Chrysler LLC -- using stock instead of cash to help fund a retiree healthcare trust. Bloom helped forge a contract with Goodyear Tire & Rubber in 2003 that required substantial debt restructuring, a scenario similar to that facing GM and Chrysler. He was an adviser to the steelworkers in 2007 when the union and the UAW agreed to the trust for parts supplier Dana Corp, which was in bankruptcy at the time. That was the first time the UAW had allowed a company to shift retiree health care to a trust and was seen as an indication the union would be amenable to creating one for GM, Chrysler and Ford Motor Co. In the early 1990s, Bloom, then an investment adviser, assisted unions in key airline restructurings. He was instrumental in employees taking a majority stake in United Airlines. Before that, he helped pilots gain stock for givebacks at Northwest Airlines, a deal that kept the carrier aloft and paid off handsomely when the industry recovered later that decade. Duane Woerth, a former president of the Air Line Pilots Association, said Bloom may have a Harvard business degree and Wall Street on his resume, but he exhibits a common touch. "He didn't come to work in thousand-dollar suits. He wore blue jeans and stayed up late and came to the crummy dives with us to eat," Woerth said. "He had the financial knowledge to understand what would work and communicate that to labor and at the same time, demand that they get adequate returns," said Woerth, whose name has been floated for a possible Obama appointment as well. Bloom exhibited the two sides of this thinking in recent years in separate venues. In a 2003 interview with BusinessWeek, Bloom cautioned against quick fixes that may please Wall Street, and said it is important to patiently understand why a company is not doing well and seek a long-term strategies that build value. Bloom flashed his union card three years later in a speech to restructuring experts, saying that in negotiations he finds it "more than a little incongruous" to be told by corporate executives "making more in an hour than a pensioner receives in a month" that labor is to blame for their problems. Gary Chaison, an industrial relations expert at Clark University in Worcester, Massachusetts, said Bloom is an ironic but crucial link for the UAW. Old economy industries like airlines, autos and steel, face new market and financial realities and more than ever require Wall Street sophistication to ensure their interests are represented even in a worse-case scenario, like bankruptcy. "I think he's sort of a compromise. He can do a bankruptcy but in the sense that he could do a bankruptcy that would protect the collective agreement, and patch together an acceptable bankruptcy to the (task force) that would be acceptable to creditors and not smack of Obama doing a special deal for union friends," Chaison said.
