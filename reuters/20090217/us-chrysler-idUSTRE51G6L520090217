 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Chrysler LLC said on Tuesday it requested another $5 billion in U.S. government aid, saying it expected the current brutal downturn in the U.S. market to run another three years. 

 Chrysler said concessions from its stakeholders -- United Auto Workers, dealers, suppliers and second lien lenders -- were implemented or fundamentally agreed upon. In its restructuring blueprint, the No. 3 U.S. automaker also said it planned to cut its outstanding debt by $5 billion and reduce fixed costs by $700 million in 2009. Chrysler, held and run by Cerberus Capital Management, has taken $4 billion in U.S. government loans. The automaker has seen its U.S. sales fall 55 percent in January after declining 30 percent in all of 2008. (Reporting by  Poornima Gupta , editing by Matthew Lewis)
