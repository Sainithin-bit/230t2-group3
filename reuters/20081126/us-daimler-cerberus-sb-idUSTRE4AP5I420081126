 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Daimler ( DAIGn.DE ) said on Wednesday talks to sell its remaining 19.9 percent stake in Chrysler to Cerberus CBS.UL had become more difficult because the U.S. private equity firm was making "exaggerated demands." 

 Cerberus agreed to buy an 80.1 percent stake in Chrysler from Daimler AG ( DAIGn.DE ) in May 2007, and Daimler confirmed in September that it was in talks with the buyout group to offload the automaker's remaining stake. A spokesman for Daimler said talks have so far neither collapsed nor otherwise ended. Cerberus' demands exceeded the value of its investment in Chrysler, Daimler said. Cerberus invested $7.2 billion to buy the majority of Chrysler, it said. (Reporting by  Maria Sheahan ; Editing by  Richard Hubbard )
