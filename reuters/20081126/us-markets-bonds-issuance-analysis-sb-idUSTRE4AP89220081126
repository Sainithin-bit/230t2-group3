 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The recent rally in government bonds globally may be nearing its eleventh hour after an historic flight to safer assets pushed yields down to their lowest since the Second World War. 

 But the moment the proverbial clock will strike midnight is the multi-trillion dollar question for bond investors. A massive tide of bond issues that the United States and other major governments are making to finance the rescue of the global banking system and to fund economic stimulus packages will ultimately overwhelm these markets, sending yields spiking up as swelling supply cheapens prices, bond analysts worry. "The iron law of fiscal expansion means government issuance cannot be revised down. The bonds will be sold, the question is (at) what price," said Meyrick Chapman, rates strategist with UBS in London. Timing is everything for fund managers still betting government debt yields can go lower, or for those temporarily hiding out in those markets and waiting for treacherous selloffs in corporate debt and stocks to abate. Once the credit crisis eases, allowing lending to flow more smoothly among banks and corporate debt markets and the downtrodden global economy shows signs of bottoming out, then investors could desert government debt in their droves, triggering a vicious selloff. "Somewhere along the line, and I am not smart enough to tell you when, some of this massive amount of money will start moving back into other types of instruments," said Leonard Santow, managing director of economic and financial consulting firm Griggs & Santow in New York and a former financial economist at the Dallas Federal Reserve. "Come on: three basis points on Treasury bills," said Santow. "If that's the way things are forever, we have real problems, so somewhere here, whether it's three months or six months away, those rates will start to be more normal. That will obviously push rates up along the curve to something half-way reasonable," he said. While the U.S. 3-month Treasury bill rate has fallen to near zero, as panicked investors flee equity markets for the shelter of ultra short-dated government instruments, the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note yield slipped this week just below 2.99 percent, the lowest in five decades. But a year from now the 10-year note's yield will have jumped to between 4.25 percent and 4.75 percent, Santow estimates. "A very strong case can be made that Treasury rates will have to go up," as issuance inundates the pool of $4.9 trillion Treasury securities outstanding, Santow says. He expects between $1.75 trillion and $2 trillion of U.S. government debt supply in the remainder of the fiscal year through September 2009, with between $600 billion and $700 billion in Treasury bills; the rest in notes and bonds. In the euro zone, sovereign debt issuance is likely to run to at least 700 billion euros ($898 billion) in 2009. In the U.K., the Debt Management Office plans to increase sales of Gilts to a record 146 billion pounds ($222 billion) in the current financial year. DANGERS OF SUCCESS: Ironically the eventual trigger for a sovereign debt selloff that would plunge major governments and corporate borrowers deeper into debt may be signs that today's bailouts costing trillions of dollars are starting to succeed in refloating the global economy. But for now, government bailouts are still swimming against the economic tide. In what may prove to be the most severe global downturn since the Great Depression, hefty investment flows are unlikely to shift out of government debt and into corporate bonds anytime soon. For now, rising U.S. government supply "can be absorbed fairly well," said Derrick Wulf, portfolio manager at Dwight Asset Management in Burlington, Vermont. The danger of corporate debt "crowding out" Treasuries will be limited, Wulf says. Yet he is starting to hedge against the risk that Treasury prices could drop once the economy starts to show signs of life. "You buy risk assets. Now it's as good a time as any. Some of them are providing equity-like returns," Wulf said, although he is buying corporate bonds cautiously, he said.. Though deflationary pressures are now taking hold across the world as commodity prices fall, bond market analysts do worry that the dramatic expansion of debt issuance may later rekindle inflation; anathema for bonds. Excessive borrowing by the private sector expanded the debt pool of mortgage and corporate paper so much that these bubbles burst dramatically, causing the worst credit crisis in a generation. Now governments could be making the same mistake of borrowing too much, analysts worry. "There is (also) an irony that the reason we got into this mess is ostensibly due to lax lending," says Chapman. "Now governments everywhere are doing their best to be as lax as possible in their lending," he said. That destabilizing scenario for government bonds could be a distant prospect, some fund managers reckon. "Until we arrest the decline in prices or deflation, it (inflation) is not a huge concern," said Wulf "Inflation concerns may come in 2009," he said, but added that it may take five years from now for yields to move a lot higher. Once U.S. note and bond yields do start to jump however, the move could be swift, warns Santow. "That of course will substantially add to the interest on the public debt and it's a real problem if you are trying to get the economy to recover," Santow said. The U.S. 10-year Treasury note's yield is a critical consideration, since this benchmark largely determines the rates at which 30-year fixed rate mortgages, a key driver of demand in the beleaguered housing market, are set.
