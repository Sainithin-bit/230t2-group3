 SYDNEY  (Reuters) - Global miner Rio Tinto Ltd/Plc ( RIO.AX ) is not yet ready to publish the advisory fees it paid for its defense against BHP Billiton's ( BHP.AX ) failed bid for the company, Rio Tinto Chairman Paul Skinner said on Wednesday. Skinner made the comments in an address to the Australian-British Chamber of Commerce. 

 On Tuesday, global miner BHP Billiton ( BHP.AX ) abandoned its hostile takeover bid for rival Rio Tinto ( RIO.AX ), blaming sliding metals prices and the threat of global recession for scuppering the mega-merger. (Reporting by  James Regan , editing by James Thornhill and  Mark Bendeich )
