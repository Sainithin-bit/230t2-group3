 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Waste Management Inc WMI.N warned on Wednesday that fourth-quarter profit would be hurt more than previously expected by falling values of recycled commodities, which have dropped 30 percent to 60 percent from last year. 

 The biggest U.S. trash hauler said this quarter's earnings would be cut by 4 cents to 8 cents per share by the deterioration in recycling commodities markets, a bigger drag than the 3-cent-per-share cut it had forecast at the end of last month. The company said the extent of the actual impact would depend on whether prices for recycling commodities stabilize or continue to deteriorate in December. Wall Street analysts are expecting the company to earn 52 cents per share in the fourth quarter, according to Reuters Estimates. Waste Management shares were down 3 percent at $28.78 in early New York Stock Exchange trade. (Reporting by  Bill Rigby ; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn)
