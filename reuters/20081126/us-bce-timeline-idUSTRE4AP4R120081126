 OTTAWA  (Reuters) - BCE Inc said on Wednesday that its C$34.8 billion ($28.2 billion) leveraged buyout is unlikely to close next month, after its accountants determined it wouldn't meet a solvency test because of the huge debt load involved in the deal. 

 It is the latest turn in the world's largest leveraged buyout deal that stretches back for more than a year and a half. Here are key events in the BCE buyout: April 9, 2007 - The Ontario Teachers Pension Plan makes a regulatory filing saying it is exploring options as the biggest shareholder in the company, whose share price had stagnated. April 10 - A media report says Ontario Teachers has enlisted U.S. buyout house Providence Equity Partners to explore a BCE buyout. BCE's shares soar to a five-year high soon afterwards. April 17 - BCE announces a strategic review of its options, and says it is in talks with a group of Canadian pension funds regarding a buyout. The funds have also enlisted U.S. private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. May 23 - BCE says it has entered privatization talks with another consortium led by Cerberus Capital Management LP. June 5 - BCE confirms a group led by Teachers has entered buyout talks with the company. June 20 - BCE announces that rival Telus Corp, Canada's No. 2 phone company, has entered into merger talks. June 30 - BCE says it has reached a "definitive" deal to be bought out by a group led by Teachers, Providence and Madison Dearborn Partners for C$42.75 per share in cash, or C$34.8 billion in total -- the world's largest leveraged buyout. September 21 - BCE shareholders overwhelmingly approve the Teachers offer. December 14 - BCE says it is not renegotiating the buyout deal after persistent speculation that it will be delayed, repriced or scrapped given tough credit market conditions. BCE's stock trades well below the takeout price of C$42.75. March 10, 2008 - BCE shares jump as investors react to a Quebec Superior Court ruling that dismisses claims by some of the company's bondholders that the deal was unfair. March 17 - BCE bondholders file appeal of the Quebec Superior Court decision. Their lawyer says the deal needs his clients' consent before it can proceed. BCE says it expects the lower court's decision to stand. May 22 - BCE shares dive some 12 percent a day after the Quebec Court of Appeal sides with the debtholders. Bondholders' lawyer says the deal is effectively dead in its current form. BCE files a motion for a fast-track appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada. June 17 - Supreme Court of Canada holds hearing into the bondholders' claims, but reserves its ruling on the matter. June 20 - The Supreme Court releases its decision after markets close, backing BCE and allowing the deal to proceed. July 4 - BCE announces its buyers will not reprice the deal and have finalized the credit funding for the purchase. The company's shares jump 13 percent. July 28 - BCE says it will cut 6 percent of the workforce at its main Bell Canada phone company, or 2,500 management jobs, to trim costs in advance of going private. With other measures the cuts aim to save C$300 million annually. Nov 24 - BCE shares jump after the U.S. government agrees to a $20 billion bail out Citigroup Inc, one of the banks financing the deal.
