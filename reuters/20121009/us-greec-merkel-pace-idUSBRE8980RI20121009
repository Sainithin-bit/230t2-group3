 ATHENS  (Reuters) - The pace of reform in Greece has accelerated, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Tuesday during a visit to Athens marred by clashes between police and protesters. 
 "I think that recently the pace of reform has picked up considerably," Merkel, on her first visit to Greece since the debt crisis erupted here in 2009, said after talks with Prime Minister Antonis Samaras. (Writing by Matt Robinson)
