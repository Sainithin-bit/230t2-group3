 (Reuters) - British defense company BAE Systems declined to comment on a German DPA news agency report on Tuesday that said its $45 billion merger talks with Airbus parent firm EADS had collapsed. 
 The two companies are working toward a Wednesday deadline by which they must inform the UK Takeover Panel of their intention to proceed with, or drop, the negotiations. (Reporting by  Jason Neely ; editing by  Paul Sandle )
