 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Hershey Co's <HSY.N quarterly profit nearly doubled, helped by higher prices for Valentine's Day and an early Easter, and the largest U.S. chocolate company raised its full-year sales and profit forecast. 

 The company expects full-year sales to rise to at least 6 percent, up from an earlier range of 3 percent to 5 percent. Hershey also forecast adjusted earnings per share to rise by "low-to-mid-teen" percentage points. Earlier it had forecast an increase of between 6 percent and 8 percent. Hershey, which faces stepped-up competition after Kraft Foods Inc KFT.N bought Cadbury earlier this year, said profit rose 94.2 percent, hitting $147.4 million, or 64 cents a share, in the first quarter, compared with $75.9 million, or 33 cents a share, a year earlier. Analysts were expecting 47 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Sales rose 13.9 percent to $1.41 billion in the first quarter, which ended April 4.
