 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Shares in internet auctioneer eBay ( EBAY.O ) plunged in Frankfurt floor trade on Thursday, after the company forecast results for the remainder of 2010 below Wall Street expectations. 

 By 0712 GMT, Frankfurt-listed shares in eBay ( EBAY.F ) were down 8.1 percent. "The forecast for eBay fell short of analysts' expectations," a Frankfurt-based trader said. Qualcomm ( QCOM.O ), the world's biggest maker of cellphone chips, also fell 8.6 percent in Frankfurt ( QCOM.F ), after forecasting lower-than-expected revenue late on Wednesday.
