 (Adds details on results, restructuring plans, 

 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Auto parts maker Visteon Corp ( VC.N ) posted a quarterly net loss on Wednesday as its biggest customer, Ford Motor Co. ( F.N ), suffered market share losses in North America. Visteon, which was once a unit of Ford, said the second half of the year would be a challenge due to lower production on a number of vehicles for which it produces parts. But it said it expects the second half to improve due to the company's restructuring. The parts maker said it is more than halfway completed with a multiyear restructuring that includes several plant closings, shifting of production to lower-cost regions, and asset sales. Visteon's net loss was $67 million, or 52 cents per share, in the second quarter, compared with net income of $50 million, or 39 cents per share, a year earlier. Analysts on average expected the Van Buren Township, Michigan-based company to report a loss of 51 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Product sales rose less than 1 percent to $2.83 billion in the quarter. Product sales to Ford fell 16 percent to $1.11 billion, while parts sales to other customers rose 15 percent to $1.72 billion. Ford, which spun off Visteon in 2000, agreed to buy back nearly two dozen Visteon facilities in 2005 and has agreed to fund several more years of Visteon's restructuring. Visteon has completed 16 of the 30 facility restructurings it has identified so far for an annual savings of $175 million. Visteon expects $400 million in total annual savings when the restructuring is completed, it said. It ended production at facilities in Virginia and Illinois during the quarter. It also started the closing of an Indiana plant and announced plans to close another Indiana facility. Visteon sold three European chassis facilities in the quarter. It also halted brake production at a Swansea facility in the United Kingdom to exit the remainder of its suspension systems operations. At the end of the quarter, more than half of Visteon's manufacturing workers and one-third of its engineering personnel were located in lower cost countries. It expects to have three-quarters of its manufacturing workers and half of its engineering workers in lower cost countries by 2009. The company also said it has won $450 million of new business in the first half of 2007. It logged $1 billion of new business in 2006. Nearly three-quarters of the 2007 new business is outside North America and it is concentrated primarily in climate and electronics, Visteon said. Visteon, which is focused on vehicle interiors, climate controls and electronics, left unchanged its forecast for a full-year loss of $35 million to $135 million, before interest and taxes and excluding restructuring expenses and noncash asset impairments. Visteon shares closed at $6.42 on Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange. Through Tuesday, the shares were down 24 percent in 2007, while the Dow Jones U.S. automobiles and parts index .DJUSAP was up nearly 10 percent.
