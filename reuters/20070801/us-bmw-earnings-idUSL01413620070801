 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - BMW ( BMWG.DE ) reported a 13.6 percent decline in second-quarter pre-tax profit to 1.065 billion euros ($1.46 billion), lagging average analyst expectations, as the strong euro weighed on results. 

 The Munich-based company, the world's largest premium carmaker, confirmed its outlook for 2007. A survey of 23 analysts polled by Reuters had on average estimated a pre-tax profit of 1.13 billion euros. "Adverse currency effects are having a greater impact on earnings than previously forecast. However, based on the BMW Group's current assessment, the negative impact will not exceed the previous year's level," the company said in a statement. It still expects pretax profit for the full-year will exceed the record level from 2006, once a one-off gain on the Rolls-Royce ( RR.L ) exchangeable bond is excluded. At its core automotive division, earnings before tax fell by 15.4 percent to 801 million euros despite a 10.2 percent gain in revenue to 14.26 billion. BMW blamed the deterioration on negative currency effects, higher raw material prices, production start-up and market launch costs for new models as well as a higher level of depreciation and research and development costs. The 5.6 percent automotive pretax margin fell far short of the 6.4 percent analysts had estimated in the poll. Despite a fundamentally strong equity story that has won many admirers among the analyst community, BMW has failed to maintain its once-lofty pretax margins mainly due to the sharp depreciation of the U.S. dollar. BMW is in the process of reviewing its entire strategy for the coming years and has not ruled out taking an active role in a possible industry consolidation.
