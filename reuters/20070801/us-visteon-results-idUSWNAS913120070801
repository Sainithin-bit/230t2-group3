 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Auto parts maker Visteon Corp ( VC.N ) posted a quarterly net loss on Wednesday as its biggest customer, Ford Motor Co. ( F.N ), suffered market share losses in North America. 

 Visteon, which was once a unit of Ford, said the second half of the year would be a challenge due to lower production on a number of vehicles for which it produces parts. But it said it expects the second half to show significant improvement from a year earlier due to the company's restructuring. The parts maker said it is more than halfway completed with a multiyear restructuring that includes several plant closings, shifting of production to lower-cost regions, and asset sales. Visteon's net loss was $67 million, or 52 cents per share, in the second quarter, compared with net income of $50 million, or 39 cents per share, a year earlier. Sales from continuing operations rose to $2.97 billion from $2.96 billion. Product sales to Ford fell 16 percent to $1.11 billion, while parts sales to other customers rose 15 percent to $1.72 billion. Ford, which spun off Visteon in 2000, agreed to buy back nearly two dozen Visteon facilities in 2005 and has agreed to fund several more years of Visteon's restructuring. Visteon, which is focused on vehicle interiors, climate controls and electronics, left unchanged its forecast for a full-year loss of $35 million to $135 million, before interest and taxes and excluding restructuring expenses and noncash asset impairments.
