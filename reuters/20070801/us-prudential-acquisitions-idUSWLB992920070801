 LONDON  (Reuters) - Britain's Prudential ( PRU.L ) said on Wednesday it continues to look at acquisition opportunities in Asia and the United States, but declined to comment on reports it considered buying U.S. rival Protective Life ( PL.N ). 

 "You would expect us ... to review all options to maximize (U.S. unit) Jackson's growth in the U.S," Chief Executive Mark Tucker told reporters, when asked about Protective Life. "We look at a number of things across the business, as all companies do, but you wouldn't expect me to comment on a specific transaction." Tucker confirmed Prudential's interest in deals remained firmly outside Britain, where a merger between the two smallest bluechip firms -- Resolution ( RSL.L ) and Friends Provident FP.L -- has rekindled speculation over deals. "We are looking for opportunities in both Asia and the U.S.," he said. "We don't see any, at this point in time, at the right price. Where we are in the cycle means that assets are expensive, but we will continue looking."
