 PARIS  (Reuters) - French bank BNP Paribas ( BNPP.PA ) said on 
Wednesday it was unaffected by problems in the U.S. subprime 
mortgage sector, which has been a cause of concern for 
financial services companies. 

  "Thanks to the good credit quality of its customer base and 
a prudent risk policy, BNP Paribas is not directly impacted by 
the current U.S. subprime mortgage crisis and the tensions in 
the LBO (leveraged buyout) market," it said in a statement.  BNP Paribas said its U.S. retail bank unit BancWest had a 
"very limited" exposure to the subprime market. It said such 
subprime mortgages counted for less than 2 percent of the 
portfolio of mortgages granted to individuals.  The group added that its investment banking arm also had a 
negligible exposure to the subprime market.  "In terms of risks, CIB (corporate and investment banking) 
has not been directly affected by the U.S. subprime crisis and 
has not observed any deterioration of its leverage finance 
portfolio, as of today. In fact, CIB's exposure to the subprime 
market is negligible," it said.  BNP Paribas Chief Executive Baudouin Prot added in a 
statement the bank was well placed to continue to perform well 
in a less favorable market environment.
