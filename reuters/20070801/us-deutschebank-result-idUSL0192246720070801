 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank ( DBKGn.DE ) sidestepped the U.S. sub-prime mortgage lending crisis to beef up profit in the second quarter on the back of strong sales and trading. 

 As credit concerns knocked markets lower around Europe, the chief executive of Germany's flagship bank told investors the business would continue to thrive even in the current rocky environment. Deutsche Bank's net profit grew by roughly a third to 1.77 billion euros ($2.43 billion) -- a second-quarter record that beat what most analysts had expected. "Some areas of the credit markets may continue to experience turbulent conditions," said Josef Ackermann, referring to the crisis sparked by American homeowners not being able to pay their mortgages. "Our business model ... is structured to deliver performance in the face of such challenges," he added. The bank's finance chief also said its involvement in the sub-prime market was limited, and that it was cautious about getting involved with hedge funds and private equity. But the words failed to calm investor nerves, jittery after a U.S. mortgage lender and two Australian funds became the latest casualties of a credit crunch rippling across the globe. Deutsche Bank's shares were down 2.5 percent at 98.40 euros at 0940 GMT, broadly in line with market falls. "Who would buy an investment bank today?" said Alan Webborn, an analyst with Societe Generale. "People have a vision that there are big risks and nobody knows when the music is going to stop and who will be left without a chair to sit on." "Nobody is going to be immune to that. Deutsche is not, and neither is any other investment bank in Europe." BUMPER TRADING Deutsche's net profit was as usual buoyed primarily by its buying and selling of debt and equity products. Revenue in debt, at 2.9 billion euros, was almost one-fifth higher than the previous year. Sales and trading of equity generated revenue of 1.4 billion euros in the second quarter -- almost twice that of a year earlier. Deutsche's investment banking arm, which includes the trading division, made a pretax profit of 2 billion euros -- almost 30 percent higher than a year ago and accounting for the lion's share of overall earnings. It mirrored the strong investment-banking result of French neighbor BNP Paribas ( BNPP.PA ). nL01677588 "The numbers are extraordinarily good," said Georg Kanders, an analyst with WestLB. "And it is also good to see that not only investment banking has done well." "Other areas such as retail banking and transaction banking -- which are the predictable and sustainable earners -- are better than expected." The bumper result comes despite the sub-prime mortgage crisis that earlier this week forced the German government to mount a rescue of small-business lender IKB. Default rates on mortgages to high-risk or sub-prime borrowers in the United States have been creeping up, following years of low interest rates and loosening credit standards. This has led to problems for the banks doing the lending as well as those sharing the risk, culminating in the recent crisis. Investors had feared Deutsche could also be hit, worries that have sent its stock tumbling by as much as 10 percent over the past fortnight. Instead, Germany's biggest listed bank saw its pretax profit in the first six months of the year approach 6 billion euros -- well on the way towards its 2008 goal of 8.4 billion euros.
