 DETROIT  (Reuters) - U.S. auto sales dropped in July as weakness in the housing market sapped demand, increasing pressure on the embattled Detroit-based automakers and hitting Toyota Motor Corp. with its first sales decline in almost three years. 

 Overall sales fell almost 9 percent, extending a slump that began in the spring as the U.S. automakers formerly known as the "Big Three" slipped below a 50 percent share of the market for the first time. General Motors Corp. posted a drop in sales of nearly 19 percent, a downturn that underscored the risks for the No. 1 U.S. automaker a day after it surprised Wall Street by posting stronger-than-expected second-quarter results. Ford Motor Co.'s sales dropped almost 17 percent, reflecting slower showroom traffic and an 18 percent decline in sales for Ford's market-leading F-Series pickup trucks. Both GM and Ford said they could be forced to lower sales outlooks for the remainder of the year, a development that could prompt more aggressive discounting and undermine margins at a time when both automakers are struggling to return to profitability in their home market. In a sign of the industry's diverging fortunes, Toyota eclipsed Ford Motor Co. as the No. 2 player in the U.S. market in year-to-date sales and for July. Honda Motor Co. edged past Chrysler Group in monthly sales to become No. 4 for July. "The twin-fold headwinds of gas prices and housing are clearly having an impact on the business," GM's chief sales analyst Paul Ballew said on a conference call. "It's something we would likely have to wrestle through between now and the end of the year and into 2008." Toyota, which had consistently bucked the downturn in U.S. sales, posted a 3.5 percent sales decline, its first such drop since August 2004. Sales for smaller rival Honda fell 3 percent, despite stepped-up incentive spending by both automakers. Nissan Motor Co. Ltd. posted a 6 percent gain on stronger sales of its newer Versa subcompact and Altima sedan. By contrast, Nissan-branded truck sales dropped 10 percent. "Some of the housing issues (and) fluctuating fuel prices are keeping consumers off balance," Nissan division chief Bill Bosley told Reuters. Chrysler Group, a majority of which is being sold off by DaimlerChrysler AG, posted a 5 percent drop in July sales on an adjusted basis. Wall Street analysts and most major automakers, including GM and Toyota, track monthly sales results after adjusting for the number of sales days. On that basis, July had one fewer day than a year earlier, meaning a difference of almost four percentage points between unadjusted and adjusted sales results for the month. SUMMER SLOWDOWN, SUMMER CLEARANCE? Jesse Toprak, analyst at sales tracking firm Edmunds.com, said the industry had missed out on some 200,000 vehicle sales in July compared to recent years, making higher incentive spending -- and better deals for consumers -- a certainty. "There is no alternative. What else can you do for a car that's already on a dealer lot? All you can do is sell the deal instead of the car," he said. Analysts had expected July sales to show a year-on-year decline, but the slump at the start of the summer selling season, when manufacturers typically look to clear inventory, was more pronounced than many had anticipated. U.S. auto sales, one of the leading indicators of consumer spending, began slowing in the second-quarter and the additional effects of a weakening housing market and relatively high gasoline prices capped demand in July, executives said. Overall vehicle sales, including heavier trucks, had run at an annualized rate of about 16.7 million vehicles in the first half but dropped to a rate of 15.54 million in July. The Detroit automakers sank to a 48 percent share of the overall market, down from a previous low of just over 50 percent in June. Asian brands accounted for 45 percent. On a combined basis, the average new car incentive, including cash rebates and concessional financing, cost manufacturers $2,524 in July, up 4 percent from a year earlier, according to Edmunds. The Detroit manufacturers set the pace on incentives, led by Chrysler at $4,082, but in a continuation of a recent trend, Japanese manufacturers also discounted more aggressively. Toyota increased its incentive spending almost 48 percent year-on-year to $1,492 per vehicle in July, while Honda's spending jumped 28 percent to $1,146, according to Edmunds. The market for pickup trucks, which accounts for about 13 percent of overall U.S. auto sales, has become the most fiercely contested segment, as automakers sacrifice margins with expensive sales offers in order to protect market share. GM, Ford, Toyota and Chrysler are all offering interest-free financing and rebates to boost truck sales, which are closely tied to construction spending and housing starts. Toyota, which GM and others have cited as being particularly aggressive in discounting, said it would reduce incentives on the Tundra for August. Toyota declined to detail the level of incentive spending on the Tundra, but said its discounts had been a response in part to double-digit sales declines for pickup trucks on an industry-wide basis in the key California market. By contrast, GM said it would be discounting more actively over the remainder of the year, especially in pickups. (Additional reporting by  Jui Chakravorty  and  Poornima Gupta )
