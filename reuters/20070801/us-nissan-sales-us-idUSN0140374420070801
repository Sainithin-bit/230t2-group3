 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co. Ltd. ( 7201.T ) said on Wednesday its U.S. sales rose 5.9 percent in July, led by strong demand for its Versa small car and Altima sedan. 

 The Japanese automaker sold 87,877 vehicles in the United States in July. U.S. sales of Nissan's namesake division rose 7.6 percent, driven by a 23.4 percent increase in car sales. Truck sales for Nissan division were down 10.2 percent. Nissan's Infiniti division sales were down 5.9 percent, the company said. Bill Bosley, vice president and general manager for Nissan Division told Reuters the slow U.S. housing market continues to make the market challenging. "Some of the housing issues (and) fluctuating fuel prices are keeping consumers off balance," he said. The results were adjusted for an extra selling day in July 2006.
