 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. antitrust authorities said on Wednesday they had approved the purchase of Hilton Hotels Corp HLT.N for $26 billion by private equity firm Blackstone Group ( BX.N ). 

 Officials have completed their review of the deal without taking action to block it, the Federal Trade Commission said in a notice. Under terms of the cash deal, Blackstone will pay $47.50 for each share of Hilton, one of the most prominent global hotel brand names. Blackstone has said it intends to invest in the Hilton properties and brands globally to grow the business.
