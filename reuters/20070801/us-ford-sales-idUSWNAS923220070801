 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co ( F.N ) on Wednesday said U.S. sales fell 19.1 percent in July, hit by a decline in showroom demand. 

 The second-largest U.S. automaker said it sold 195,245 vehicles in July, down from 241,339 vehicles a year earlier. The company said retail, or showroom, sales fell 17 percent, while sales to car rental companies were down 57 percent. Results for Ford -- which had sought to cut its lower-margin fleet sales to car rental companies -- include its import brands and some medium- and heavy-duty trucks. The results are not adjusted for an extra selling day in July 2006.
