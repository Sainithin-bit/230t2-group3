 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Dow Jones & Co. Inc. will pay News Corp. a $165 million fee if a deal to buy the company is terminated, the company said in a filing on Wednesday. 

 In addition, if the deal is voted down by shareholders, Dow Jones will reimburse News Corp's expenses, up to $25 million, the filing said. News Corp. said Wednesday it would buy Dow Jones for $5.6 billion, adding the Wall Street Journal to its worldwide media empire and ending a century of family ownership of one of the top U.S. business news sources.
