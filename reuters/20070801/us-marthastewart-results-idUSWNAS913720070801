 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia Inc. ( MSO.N ) reported a wider quarterly loss on Wednesday, due in part to weak sales of its products at retailer Kmart. 

 The second-quarter net loss was $6.7 million, or 13 cents a share, compared with a loss of $1.2 million, or 2 cents a share, in the same quarter a year earlier. Revenue rose 7.7 percent to $73.4 million on higher advertising sales at its flagship magazine, Martha Stewart Living.
