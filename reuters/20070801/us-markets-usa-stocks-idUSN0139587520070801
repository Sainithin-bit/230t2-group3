 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Stocks surged in a last-minute rally on Wednesday as investors snapped up shares beaten down by worries over deteriorating credit conditions. 

 Major stock gauges zigzagged wildly throughout the session. The Dow swung between positive and negative dozens of times and the S&P 500 changed direction even more frequently. In the final minutes of trading, the Dow turned positive in a 180-point burst higher -- the mirror image of Tuesday's last-minute swoon by the blue chips. Shares of United Technologies, which have fallen 3 percent since last Thursday's stock market slide, rose 2.3 percent and led the Dow higher. "People have been nervous and when you have these tough markets, you get rallies like this, which are breath-taking," said Bobby Harrington, head of block origination at UBS in Stamford. Connecticut. "I'm still not sure we're out of the woods completely yet, but the bulls won today." The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 150.38 points, or 1.14 percent, to end at 13,362.37. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index gained 10.54 points, or 0.72 percent, to finish at 1,465.81. The Nasdaq Composite Index rose 7.60 points, or 0.30 percent, at 2,553.87. In the last few minutes, several events collided as market participants sold off U.S. Treasury bonds, while in futures trading, investors covered short positions set up earlier in the day on bets the market would continue to fall. "You really had a flight to quality. A lot of stocks that were crushed pared their losses and the flight to quality went right into the blue chips," said John Buckingham, chief investment officer at Al Frank Asset Management, in Laguna Beach, California. Utilities, known for consistent returns and high dividends that are attractive in times of volatility, were the S&P 500's top performers. An S&P index of utilities' stocks rose 2.71 percent. United Technologies, whose products range from Carrier air conditioners to Pratt & Whitney jet engines, advanced 2.3 percent, or $1.68, to finish at $74.65 on the New York Stock Exchange. Shares of Whole Foods Market Inc. rose 6.7 percent to $39.52 on the Nasdaq, a day after it reported a quarterly profit that had dropped less than Wall Street anticipated. WILD RIDE FOR BUILDERS AND BANKERS Investors remain sensitive to news about worsening lending conditions, which pummeled global equity markets last week. Credit market concerns pushed the S&P 500 down 3.2 percent in July, its worst performance in three years. Rumors swirling around home builder Beazer Homes USA Inc. spooked the market at midday. The stock fell as much as 42 percent before recovering somewhat to end down 18 percent at $11.48 after Beazer said talk that it would file for bankruptcy was unfounded. The Dow Jones home builder index closed 0.8 percent lower, after skidding more than 9 percent earlier in the session to its lowest point since 2003. The CBOE Volatility Index -- known as Wall Street's fear gauge -- rose to 26.22, its highest level in four years, during the session. The VIX closed at 23.67, up 0.6 percent. Bank and brokerage stocks tumbled after Bear Stearns Cos. Inc. said it halted redemptions in a hedge fund after nervous investors sought to withdraw money. Two Bear Stearns hedge funds collapsed last month due to the meltdown in the subprime mortgage market. Bear Stearns shares slid 2.4 percent to $118.30 on the NYSE, while an index of brokers' stocks fell 1.6 percent. OIL SLIPS AFTER RECORD HIGH A sharp downturn in the price of oil sent many energy companies' shares lower. Nevertheless, Exxon Mobil shares rose 0.8 percent to $85.84 after swinging between positive and negative throughout the day -- reflecting the market's volatility. Exxon's stock ran from a session high at $86.92 to a slide to an intraday low of $83.61. U.S. crude oil futures dropped sharply, after earlier hitting a record at $78.77 a barrel. Economic news took a back seat, even as U.S. manufacturing grew at a slower rate in July, while U.S. private employers probably added jobs last month at their slowest rate in four years, according to two reports released on Wednesday. Trading was heavy on the NYSE, with about 2.42 billion shares changing hands, above last year's estimated daily average of 1.84 billion, while on Nasdaq, about 3.01 billion shares traded, also surging ahead of last year's daily average of 2.02 billion. In spite of the rally late in the day, declining stocks still outnumbered advancing ones by a ratio of about 19 to 14 on the NYSE and by 3 to 2 on Nasdaq. (Additional reporting by Cal Mankowski)
