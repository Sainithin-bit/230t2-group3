 DETROIT  (Reuters) - General Motors Corp ( GM.N ) on Wednesday said U.S. sales fell 18.5 percent in July, attributing the decline to a cutback in fleet sales to daily rental companies and a "challenging industry." 

 GM said it sold 320,935 vehicles in the United States last month, down from 410,332 vehicles a year earlier. The results were adjusted for an extra selling day in July 2006.
