 ATLANTA  (Reuters) - Home Depot Inc. ( HD.N ) said on Wednesday it had fired four merchandising associates who violated the company's ethical standards and said the matter is under investigation by federal authorities. 

 "The Home Depot has terminated four merchandising associates for infractions of our ethical standards," the company said in a statement. "We're cooperating with authorities and because this matter is under investigation, we can't comment further on the specifics." It added the matter "does not have a material effect on our consolidated financial conditions or results of operations." A spokesman for Atlanta-based Home Depot, the world's largest home improvement retailer, said the workers who were terminated were based in Georgia. On Tuesday, CBS News reported that four Home Depot purchasing managers are alleged to have taken kickbacks totaling millions of dollars to make sure that certain flooring products got onto the retailer's shelves. CBS reported that the Federal Bureau of Investigation "is said to be investigating." The FBI's Atlanta Field Office said it had no comment on any possible investigation. A representative for the federal prosecutor's office in Atlanta could not be immediately reached for comment. Home Depot plans to hold its annual merchandising staff meeting on Thursday. Earlier this year, Chairman and Chief Executive Frank Blake identified flooring as one category in which Home Depot had lost market share. The retailer is boosting its capital spending this year, and some of those funds are being used to overhaul departments such as flooring. Shares of Atlanta-based Home Depot were down 20 cents to $36.97 in late morning New York Stock Exchange trading. (Reporting by  Karen Jacobs  in Atlanta and  Jessica Wohl  in Chicago)
