 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co.( F.N ) said on Wednesday that it will reassess its forecast for industry-wide U.S. sales in 2007, given the sharp drop in July sales. 

 Ford's current industry forecast is at 16.8 million vehicles. "We think something in this range is feasible in light of these consumer fundamentals and the overall pace of the economy," said Ellen Hughes-Cromwick, Ford's chief economist. "But we are certainly going to reassess this once we get the final data for the July sales."
