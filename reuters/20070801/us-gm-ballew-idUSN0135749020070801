 DETROIT  (Reuters) - General Motors Corp's ( GM.N ) chief sales analyst Paul Ballew said on Wednesday a weak housing market and high fuel prices would weigh on U.S. vehicle sales through the remainder of 2007 and into 2008. 

 "The twinfold headwinds of gas prices and housing are clearly having an impact on the business," Ballew said on a conference call with analysts and reporters after the automaker reported a 19 percent drop in July sales. "It's something we would likely have to wrestle through between now and the end of the year and into 2008." he said. Ballew said the headwinds have been particularly challenging in some of the coastal markets and parts of the upper Midwest. He estimated July industry vehicle sales at about 15.4 million units on an annualized basis. Ballew also said he expects the industry to end 2007 with sales of 16.6 million to 16.7 million vehicles on an annualized basis. Ballew said GM would be more aggressive on incentive spending over the remainder of the year, in response to heavy discounting from competitors, particularly on pickup trucks. The market for pickup trucks, which account for about 13 percent of overall U.S. auto sales, has become the most fiercely contested segment, as automakers sacrifice margins with expensive sales offers in order to protect market share. In July, GM, Ford Motor Co ( F.N ), Toyota Motor Corp ( 7203.T ) and Chrysler were all offering interest-free financing and cash rebates to bolster sales of pickups, which are closely tied to construction spending and housing starts. "We are not going to let the competition run that far down in front of us as they did in June," Ballew said. "They've been extremely aggressive ... and we can't allow competition to discount to that extent without evaluating some response," he said, referring to the pickup truck category. Sales of GM's Chevrolet-branded full-size pickups fell more than 27 percent in July. Sales of the GMC Sierra fell nearly 28 percent. As the incentive war heats up, Ballew said pickup sales would recover slightly through the rest of the year. "We believe full-size pickups will show some recovery given the amount of emphasis from vehicle manufacturers," he said. Ballew also said he expected the industry challenges to impact the truck-based SUV and mid-size van segments the most. Ballew said GM ended July with an inventory of 948,000 units, which included 267,000 cars and 681,000 trucks.
