 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Jones Apparel Group Inc. ( JNY.N ) on Wednesday posted a quarterly net loss on declining sales, discontinued operations and one-time restructuring costs, and it cut its full-year earnings outlook. 

 The owner of Jones New York and Nine West, whose shares fell nearly 8 percent, also said it planned to accept a $900 million offer for its Barneys New York chain from Japan's Fast Retailing Co. Ltd. ( 9983.T ) unless Dubai-owned private equity firm Istithmar sweetens its $825 million bid to at least match the rival offer. Istithmar has not said if it would raise its bid, which Jones accepted in June while saying it would weigh offers for the whole company through August 11. Jones said on Wednesday that it had not yet received any bids for the whole company. The New York-based company, which is in the process of trying to exit or sell some of its moderately priced product lines, has struggled recently because of stiff competition from consolidating department stores that are promoting their own private brands. In the latest quarter, Jones said, a softer retail business overall led to declining same-store sales at its retail stores and greater-than-expected markdowns on its wholesale products. Jones posted a net loss of $47.1 million, or 44 cents per share, compared with a year-earlier profit of $36.6 million, or 32 cents a share. But excluding results of discontinued operations and such items as expenses for restructuring and a strategic review of its business, Jones earned 17 cents per share from continuing operations. Analysts on average were expecting a profit of 31 cents per share, excluding items, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue fell 2 percent to $903.9 million, as same-store sales fell 8 percent. Jones said it was now targeting adjusted earnings per share of $1.28 to $1.34 for the full year. Excluding Barneys, the new range is $1.20 to $1.25, the company said. Analysts on average had been expecting $1.99, according to Reuters Estimates. The company had previously forecast a range of $1.95 to $2.05. Jones put itself up for sale last year, but failed to find a buyer. Jones shares were down $1.96, or 7.9 percent, at $23 in morning New York Stock Exchange trade. Through Tuesday's close, the stock had fallen 25 percent this year, compared with gains of 1 percent in the Dow Jones U.S. Clothing and Accessories Index .DJUSCF and 2.6 percent in the Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX . Jones shares were trading at 12.5 times earnings estimates for the current fiscal year, a deep discount to rivals such as Liz Claiborne Inc. LIZ.N, which has a multiple of 17.9, and VF Corp. ( VFC.N ), 16.2.
