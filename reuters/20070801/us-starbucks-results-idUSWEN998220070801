 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Starbucks Corp reported a 9 percent rise in quarterly earnings on Wednesday, helped by new stores, and stood by its full-year profit outlook despite fears of a cut, sending shares up 4 percent. 

 Net income for the fiscal third quarter was $158 million, or 21 cents per share, in line with the average estimate of Wall Street analysts, according to Reuters Estimates. In the same period last year, Starbucks earned $145 million, or 18 cents per share. "This is being viewed as a bit of relief given that we knew that there was some pressure on the top line," said McAdams Wright Ragen analyst Dan Geiman, who has a "buy" rating on Starbucks shares. "The fact that they reiterated their guidance for the fiscal year was a positive as well." Starbucks warned in June it would be "very challenging" for the company to meet the high end of its 2007 earnings forecast due to rising dairy prices and slowing sales growth in its U.S. business. It repeated that warning on Wednesday, but stood by the outlook. Revenue rose 20 percent to $2.4 billion. Analysts had been expecting revenue of $2.39 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. Sales at coffee shops open at least 13 months, a key retail measure known as same-store sales, rose 4 percent. Customer transactions increased 1 percent, while the average value per transaction was up 3 percent. Chief Executive Jim Donald said "a lot of things" kept customer transaction growth small, including new stores taking business from older ones and weakened consumer spending. "Maybe people aren't going four times a week," he said. "Maybe it's three times a week." Operating margins fell to 10.4 percent of net revenue from 10.9 percent a year ago due to higher dairy and rent costs, as well as a shift in sales to products that cost more to make. To help offset rising costs, Starbucks earlier this week raised prices on coffee and other drinks by an average of 9 cents a cup. For the full year, Starbucks still expects to earn between 87 cents per share and 89 cents per share. Wall Street analysts, on average, are expecting earnings of 88 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. For fiscal 2008, Starbucks expected same-store sales growth of 3 percent to 7 percent and earnings per share growth of 20 percent to 22 percent. The coffee chain also set a fiscal 2008 earnings per share growth target of 20 percent to 22 percent on net revenue growth of 18 percent. Those are lower than the company's goals in recent years of 20 to 25 percent EPS growth on revenue growth of about 20 percent. Donald said the targets were still "very strong." The company plans to open 2,600 stores in fiscal 2008, 200 more than in the current year. International expansion accounts for all of the increase. Starbucks' shares have been battered this year due to investor concerns about slowing U.S. growth, higher costs and increased competition from fast-food rivals such as McDonald's Corp. and Dunkin' Donuts. Its shares rose to $28.28 in after hours trading from a close of $27.20 on Nasdaq. The stock is down about 23 percent in 2007, compared with a 1.6 percent decline in the Dow Jones U.S. restaurants and bars index .DJUSRU>. (Additional reporting by  Peter Henderson )
