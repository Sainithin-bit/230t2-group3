 DETROIT  (Reuters) - DaimlerChrysler AG DCXGn.DE said on Wednesday that U.S. sales fell 9 percent in July, despite market-leading incentives aimed at clearing inventory at Chrysler Group. 

 The automaker, in the process of selling Chrysler Group, sold 156,314 total vehicles in July, down from 171,940 vehicles a year earlier. Sales at Chrysler Group, which consists of the Chrysler, Jeep and Dodge brands, fell 8 percent in July, despite high incentives and a new "lifetime" powertrain warranty on almost all of its new vehicles, rolled out towards the end of the month. Chrysler Group sold 137,728 vehicles in July. Sales at Mercedes fell 14 percent to 18,586 vehicles.
