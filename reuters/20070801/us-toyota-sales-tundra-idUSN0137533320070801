 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp ( 7203.T ) said on Wednesday that consumer incentives on its new Tundra pickup truck in the United States would be lower this month compared with July. 

 The Japanese automaker, which saw sales fall 3.5 percent in July, declined to specify the exact rebate on the pickup truck, but said it was lower than reported. Industry-tracking firm Edmunds.com estimates that the Tundra carries incentives worth $6,861 on average, the highest of any full-size pickup truck. Sales of the revamped Tundra more than doubled in July from a year earlier. The battle for the pickup truck segment has been watched closely because it remains a stronghold for struggling Detroit- based automakers. (Reporting by  Poornima Gupta )
