 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Dealing with the wing cracks found in Airbus A380 superjumbos could cost the European plane maker up to 100 million euros ($132 million), a German magazine reported. 
 Checking and repairing the wings of the 69 aircraft already in service could cost about 70 million euros, weekly Der Spiegel said on Sunday, citing unidentified industry experts and people at Airbus. Changing the production process at Airbus, which is a unit of European Aeronautic Defence & Space Co. ( EAD.PA ), would account for the remainder, it said. The magazine cited an Airbus spokesman as saying a long-term technical solution would by found by the summer but that he would not comment on costs. European air safety officials extended checks for A380 wing cracks to the entire superjumbo fleet on Wednesday and said the defects could pose a safety risk if ignored.
