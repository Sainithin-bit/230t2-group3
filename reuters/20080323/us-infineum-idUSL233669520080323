 LONDON  (Reuters) - Carlyle Group and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts are among several private equity firms keen on British biofuel additives producer Infineum, the Telegraph reported on Sunday. 

 Apollo Management, BC Partners, Cinven, and Vestar are the other firms planning to submit bids for Infineum, a firm valued at up to 2.5 billion euros ($3.87 billion) which is owned by Royal Dutch Shell Plc and ExxonMobil, the paper said. Both Shell and ExxonMobil are keen to secure offers of between 2-2.5 billion euros for Infineum, which had turnover of about $1.5 billion in 2006, the paper said. Officials at Infineum could not immediately be reached for comment. Oxfordshire-based Infineum, which employs 1,600 people globally, is undergoing a strategic review initiated by its shareholders and handled by bankers at JP Morgan, the paper said. It is among the world's largest manufacturers and marketers of petroleum additives for the fuels and lubricants industry, the Telegraph noted. (Reporting by Hsu Chuang Khoo, Editing by Rory Channing)
