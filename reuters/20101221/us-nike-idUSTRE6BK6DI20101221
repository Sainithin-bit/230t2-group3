 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Nike Inc ( NKE.N ) posted future orders data that missed many analysts' expectations on Tuesday, sending shares of the world's largest athletic shoe and clothing maker down more than 5 percent. 

 The company said future orders, excluding currency exchange rates -- a key measure of sales growth -- rose 11 percent. "They didn't beat rising expectations for future orders and that's why the stock's down," said John Fisher, portfolio manager with Fifth Third Asset Management, which owns Nike shares. He said that Wall Street was looking for future orders growth of 12 to 13 percent. Net income in the fiscal second quarter rose 22 percent to $457 million, or 94 cents a share, from $375 million or 76 cents a share in the year-earlier period. Analysts had expected 88 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Sales in the quarter ended November 30 rose 10 percent to $4.84 billion, above the $4.81 billion analysts had expected. Excluding currency fluctuations, revenue rose 11 percent. Orders for Nike brand shoes and apparel scheduled for delivery from December 2010 through April 2011 totaled $7.7 billion, up 11 percent from a year ago and with minimal impact due to currency effects. Sterne Agee and Barclays Capital had expected future order growth, excluding currency effects, of 12 to 13 percent, UBS had expected 13 percent and Susquehanna International Group had forecast growth in the mid-teens range. However, others had expected a lower increase, including Stifel Nicolaus (10 to 12 percent) and McAdams Wright Ragen (10 to 11 percent). Orders are a key gauge of demand and the company in the first quarter saw them rise 13 percent, which marked the biggest increase in more than a decade. Shares fell to $87.35 in after-hours trading, down 5.4 percent from Tuesday's closing price of $92.30 on the New York Stock Exchange. Nike shares hit an all-time high of $92.49 earlier in the day. The stock has risen almost 19 percent since the company reported stronger-than-expected first-quarter results and surging consumer demand on September 23. "The stock's had a really good run here in a short amount of time, and there's going to be some profit taking," Fifth Third's Fisher said. "I don't take away any negatives from this at all."
