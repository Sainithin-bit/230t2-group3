 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Bank of Japan Governor Masaaki Shirakawa said on Tuesday the central bank will carefully examine the impact of long-term interest rate moves on the country's economy. 

 Shirakawa said the central bank's monetary easing steps in October have had some effect in pushing down longer-term interest rates in Japan, which have largely traced rises in U.S. Treasury yields. He also repeated his view that upside and downside risks to Japan's economy are roughly balanced, but expressed caution on worsening business sentiment. Below are key quotes from Shirakawa's news conference after a BOJ policy meeting: LONG-TERM RATES "In Japan, long-term interest rates have not risen as rapidly as in developed countries in the West. But global rises in interest rates including in Japan stem from rises in U.S. long-term rates due to receding pessimism about the U.S. economic outlook and receding expectations for U.S. monetary easing. "Long-term interest rates reflect the economic and price situations as well as market players' views on them ... At the same time, fluctuations in long-term rates could affect the economy, prices and the financial situation through their impact on funding costs at companies and households, and profits at financial institutions that hold massive government bonds. "Based on these factors, the BOJ will closely examine trends in interest rates and their impact from now on." YEN "One factor behind the yen's rise was investors' risk aversion ... In general, the yen will rise in a situation where uncertainty about the overall world economy grows, as that pushes up demand for the yen as a safe currency. I think there were such factors behind the yen's rise this summer. "There are various uncertainties about the U.S. economic outlook, but compared with growing pessimism seen this summer it is leaning in a somewhat optimistic direction, and that has caused investors' risk aversion to weaken. "U.S. long-term interest rates, which fell sharply amid expectations for the introduction of the so-called QE2 and have risen since then, may be a factor behind currency moves. "I will closely watch currency moves but won't comment on the outlook." ECONOMY "In the December tankan, all companies' views on current economic conditions worsened only moderately but they expect conditions to worsen, particularly at manufacturers. This shows that uncertainty about the outlook cannot be easily dispelled and companies' cautious views persist ... "Our views on the Japanese economy's outlook are unchanged from the median views of the October outlook report ... "There may be slight differences in how each of the nine policy board members views the balance of risks to the Japanese economy. But based on what I heard from the members, there is no change in the view that upside and downside risks are roughly balanced ... "The fog hasn't cleared yet. Behind this is continued uncertainty over the global economy." U.S. ECONOMY "Balance sheet adjustments chiefly at households continue to weigh on the U.S. economy. Compared to the summer some bright signs have emerged for the U.S. economy, but we need to recognize that the economy's basic trend centers on the burden of balance sheet adjustments." BANKS' RESERVES AT BOJ "In the framework under the current comprehensive easing, we're not targeting the outstanding balance of banks' deposits with the BOJ in conducting daily monetary adjustments, unlike during the past period of quantitative easing. "But as the BOJ rolls out various monetary easing including comprehensive easing in the coming year, the amount of fund supply will increase and as a result the balance of banks' deposits with the BOJ will increase. "But we are not aiming to expand the volume itself as we will achieve our policy objectives of affecting longer-term rates and risk premiums through various operations. The BOJ is guiding policy as such, just like the Federal Reserve, so the outstanding balance of banks' reserves fluctuates from day to day."
