 TOKYO  (Reuters) - The Bank of Japan kept monetary policy steady as widely expected, holding off on easing as it scrutinizes how escalating debt woes in Europe and a U.S.-driven rise in bond yields affect the economy. 

 KEY POINTS: -- As widely expected, the BOJ kept interest rates unchanged at a range of zero to 0.1 percent by unanimous vote. -- The BOJ maintained its assessment on the economy, saying growth seems to be pausing but the economy is expected to return to a moderate recovery path. -- Governor Masaaki Shirakawa will hold a news conference later on Tuesday, with his comments expected to come out sometime after 4:15 p.m. (0715 GMT). COMMENTARY: SEIJI SHIRAISHI, CHIEF ECONOMIST, HSBC SECURITIES JAPAN "The BOJ's view on the economy, that it will be at a standstill in the coming months and likely recover after that, is what the markets also think. And given a recent easing in the yen's strength, there is less chance of the BOJ taking additional easing steps, as long as the economy develops in the way the BOJ thinks it will. "That said, if the U.S. economy falters and that leads the market to spotlight U.S. debt problems, its higher jobless rate and deflationary pressure, the dollar could fall again. If the yen firms enough to hurt share prices and expectations grow for an adverse impact on Japan's economy, there is a possibility that the BOJ will increase the size of its asset buying scheme." KYOHEI MORITA, CHIEF ECONOMIST, BARCLAYS CAPITAL JAPAN "Generally (the decision) was in line with expectations. We are not expecting a further easing as a main scenario. On the other hand, if the yen rises further and it looks like it might stay strong, then the BOJ will probably move to do something if it interprets the yen rise as something that could have a deflationary impact on the real economy. "But we don't think (any easing) would be centered on quantitative measures. What's lacking in Japan is not the amount of money ... but the channels for that money to flow." Regarding the rise in JGB yields: "The rises are in JGB and Treasury yields and the reality is that the big sellers are Japanese banks. What Japan must do in that respect is a topic that Governor Shirakawa would probably have to touch upon. "But that wouldn't necessarily signal the BOJ trying to directly rein in the rise in yields, since it wasn't the central bank's policy that caused the rises in the first place." TAKUJI OKUBO, CHIEF ECONOMIST, SOCIETE GENERALE SECURITIES "No change doesn't mean no message. The BOJ is saying they remain cautious despite the market being more optimistic. I think the BOJ is trying to calm the JGB market by saying recovery is still uncertain. "The BOJ may be fine now with the current level of yields, but if the short end of the curve starts to price in the chance of a rate hike within the next two years, I don't think the BOJ would want that. They want to keep borrowing costs low for companies. "The biggest uncertainty is in the United States. If the market decides that the Federal Reserve's quantitative easing is a mirage, the yen would rise and stocks would tank. That could prompt the BOJ to increase asset purchases, maybe to 7.5 or 10 trillion yen." HIROKATA KUSABA, SENIOR ECONOMIST, MIZUHO RESEARCH INSTITUTE "Even though Japan's economic fundamentals are not good, the BOJ is in no position to ease policy further anytime soon given that the yen has fallen from highs seen in autumn and ruling party lawmakers are too busy dealing with their own mess to meddle in monetary policy. "The trigger will come in April-June when the impact on the Japanese economy from a slowdown in the United States, Europe and China becomes more evident. "The U.S. economy will prove weaker than market players are thinking now, and that will push down its bond yields, which would cause the yen to rise again and pressure the BOJ to do more as interest rate differentials narrow. "The BOJ's next step will be doubling its 5-trillion yen asset-buying scheme. The BOJ would buy more JGBs and corporate debt rather than REITs and ETFs which are seen as volatile and hurting its balance sheet."
