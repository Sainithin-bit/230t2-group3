 DUBLIN  (Reuters) - Irish President Mary McAleese signed into law on Tuesday a controversial banking bill which gives the finance minister sweeping powers to overhaul the banking sector. 

 McAleese had convened a meeting of a body known as the Council of State to advise her on whether the law, which would also impose losses on subordinated bondholders, should be referred to the Supreme Court. "The president has signed the bill," her office said. (Reporting by Yara Bayoumy)
