 DUBLIN  (Reuters) - Ireland risked a fresh complication to radical plans to overhaul its financial sector on Tuesday with a controversial new banking law facing a possible constitutional veto by the country's top court. 

 The legislation gives the state wide-ranging powers to restructure the banking industry as part of an 85 billion euros ($112 billion) EU/IMF bailout package. But its scope has raised objections from the European Central Bank (ECB) and opposition politicians, who warned it will make Finance Minister Brian Lenihan a "one-man legislature. President Mary McAleese has held off signing the bill into law amid until she hears advice about its constitutionality on Tuesday from the Council of State, a panel of top political figures including the prime minister, attorney general and High Court President. She will then decide whether to ask the Supreme Court to rule if the law or parts of it is constitutional, a move which could delay plans by government for junior creditors in Irish banks to swallow losses on their investments. Her decision is expected later on Tuesday or Wednesday. The cut-off date for her to either sign the bill or send it to the court is Thursday. "It looks likely that President McAleese will send the bill to the Supreme Court," said Fergal O'Leary, head of capital markets at Glas Securities. "I would say there is a market expectation that the Supreme Court might very well turn it down." The bill gives the minister for finance the power to impose losses on subordinated bondholders. Under the EU/IMF deal, the government has agreed to restructure some junior bank debt by the end of March to help meet higher capital requirements. "The tone of the bill suggests that the Minister would prefer to go down the voluntary road in terms of buyback/ exchange as an initial step before potentially pursuing a more aggressive coercive approach," said O'Leary. ELECTION DELAY NOT ENVISAGED The complex bill, which was passed by the lower chamber last week after just four hours of debate, gives Lenihan the power to transfer banks' assets and liabilities and sack bank directors. The ECB has criticised the legislation saying it could force it to take losses on the collateral it accepts in exchange for loans. It has also warned the bill could compromise the independence of Ireland's central bank. The ECB has lent banks in Ireland 136 billion euros, a quarter of all its outstanding loans and the Irish central bank has given them 45 billion euros in emergency liquidity assistance amid uncertainty about the future of the sector. The Supreme Court will be on Christmas break from Wednesday and would be unlikely to hold a hearing on the bill until it returns on January 11. A decision could take a couple of weeks. If the Supreme Court rules the bill is unconstitutional the government will have to introduce new legislation to parliament. If it says it does not breach the constitution then it cannot be subject to further legal challenges or amendments. Although the government was sharply criticised for rushing the bill through parliament analysts said it would likely push new legislation, if required, through quickly again, preventing a delay in calling a parliamentary election. The Green party, the junior coalition partner, has said it wants an election called once the budgetary process, which could run into early February, is completed and a new banking bill could be completed by that stage. "It's very unlikely that this (banking) bill will delay the election even in the, probably unlikely event, that it has to be put to the oireachtas (parliament) in a new form," said Noel Whelan, a barrister and political commentator.
