 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - President Barack Obama said on Tuesday a vote by U.S. communications regulators to prevent Internet providers from blocking lawful content will help present the free and open nature of the Internet. 

 "As technology and the market continue to evolve at a rapid pace, my administration will remain vigilant and see to it that innovation is allowed to flourish, that consumers are protected from abuse, and that the democratic spirit of the Internet remains intact," he said in a statement.
