 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - The European Central Bank called for bids in its longer-term tender on Tuesday, offering banks unlimited funds at an interest rate fixed to its main refinancing rate. 

 The ECB's main refi rate has been on hold at a record low of 1.0 percent since May of last year, and analysts expect them to remain at that level until the fourth quarter of next year. Bids in the 98-day tender are due by 0830 GMT (3:30 p.m.) on Wednesday. The start date is December 23 and the maturity date March 31. In a Reuters poll, analysts forecast demand of 105 billion euros. The ECB will also carry out a 13-day tender on Thursday to help banks over the often tense year-end period in money markets. The 16-country bloc's central bank started providing banks with unlimited amounts of cash to stave off effects of the financial crisis after it intensified. It threw out original plans to continue with its exit from crisis support measures earlier this month, deciding to continue to provide unrestricted funding to money markets until at least mid-April. On Tuesday, the ECB also lent banks 193 billion euros in a 7-day operation, conducted on full allotment basis. The amount was more than a week earlier, when they lapped up 188 billion, and exceeded analysts expectations of 185 billion take-up this week. The central bank also drained 72.5 billion euros in weekly funds to ensure its bond-buying program does not increase inflationary pressures.
