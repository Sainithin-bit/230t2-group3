 PARIS  (Reuters) - Stock index futures pointed to a higher open on Wall Street on Tuesday, with futures for the S&P 500 up 0.36 percent, Dow Jones futures up 0.32 percent and Nasdaq 100 futures up 0.27 percent at 0928 GMT (4:28 a.m. EDT). 

 Adobe Systems Inc ( ADBE.O ) will be in focus after it issued an earnings forecast sharply above Wall Street projections, contrasting sharply with a pessimistic outlook three months ago when it was concerned about the weak economy. Its shares surged more than 7 percent afterhours, and were up 4.4 percent on Frankfurt ( ADBE.F ) on Tuesday. Genzyme Corp GENZ.O held its second investor meeting in two months to argue that its most promising experimental drug will capture five times the sales that Sanofi-Aventis ( SASY.PA ) has assumed in a hostile $18.5 billion takeover bid. Dutch chemicals group DSM ( DSMN.AS ) said on Tuesday it would buy Martek Biosciences Corporation MATK.O for $1.087 billion (829 million euros) in cash to specialize further in the niche food nutrition industry. Constellation Brands Inc ( STZ.N ) is close to selling most of its non-U.S. wine portfolio, the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday, citing people familiar with the matter. Alpha Natural Resources ( ANR.N ) has made an offer for rival U.S. coal miner Massey Energy MEE.N, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing members of Massey Energy's board. Toronto-Dominion Bank ( TD.TO ) is close to an agreement to buy Chrysler Financial from private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management CBS.UL for $6.3 billion, a source familiar with the matter said on Monday. Jabil Circuit Inc ( JBL.N ) posted market-beating first-quarter results, helped by strong growth across segments, and forecast a robust second quarter, sending shares of the electronics manufacturing services provider up 3.5 percent in trading after the bell. U.S. diversified manufacturer 3M Co ( MMM.N ) denied on Monday a published report that its top executive, George Buckley, was seeking to step down before his contract expires in early 2012. Oil prices rose for the third straight session on Tuesday, supported by cold weather in the United States and Europe, seasonal gasoline demand and an expected drop in U.S. crude stocks. European stocks were up 0.7 percent in morning trade in thin volume, with record-high copper prices helping mining stocks while investors brushed aside Moody's warning it may downgrade Portugal's debt rating. On the earnings front, ConAgra Foods ( CAG.N ), Carnival Corp. ( CCL.N ), Cintas Corp. ( CTAS.O ), Nike ( NKE.N ) and Red Hat Inc ( RHT.N ) are among companies expected to report results. U.S. stocks tacked on further gains to push the S&P 500 to a two-year high on Monday, continuing a steady upward march investors believe will continue in 2011. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  dipped 13.78 points, or 0.12 percent, to 11,478.13. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  added 3.17 points, or 0.25 percent, to 1,247.08. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  rose 6.59 points, or 0.25 percent, to 2,649.56. (Reporting by  Blaise Robinson ; Editing by Hans Peters)
