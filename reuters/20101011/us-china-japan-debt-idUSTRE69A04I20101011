 BEIJING  (Reuters) - China's sell-off of Japanese debt in August reflects Beijing's determination to better manage its foreign exchange reserves and had nothing to do with politics, an official newspaper reported on Monday. 

 Chinese investors sold a record 2.0 trillion yen ($24.4 billion) in short-term Japanese bills in August, nearly reversing its hefty accumulation in the previous seven months. Observers were surprised by the apparent about-turn, having previously viewed China's purchases of Japanese debt as an indication of its greater diversification of foreign exchange reserves. There was nothing unusual about the flows in either direction, the Shanghai Securities News reported. "In our investment activities, we always pay close attention to and analyze all kinds of fluctuations," an unnamed official from the State Administration of Foreign Exchange was cited as saying. "We continuously conduct operations to dynamically adjust and perfect (our investments). A political explanation is not necessary," the official said. Some commentators have said that China was in part responding to anger in Tokyo that its buying of Japanese debt had been a major factor pushing up the value of the yen. The revelation that China was a big net seller of yen in August has undermined this criticism, since the Japanese currency continued its steady upward march against the dollar during that month and since.
