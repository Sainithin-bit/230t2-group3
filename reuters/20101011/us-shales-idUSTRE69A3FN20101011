 (Reuters) - After a boom in U.S. shale gas deals, attention is switching to the oil-rich shales such as Bakken, with analysts predicting a pick-up in M&A and joint venture activity - triggered in part by a drop in gas prices and firm crude prices. 

 Following are some major shale oil and gas acquisitions since 2009: OCTOBER 2010: * Plains Exploration & Production Co PXP.N spent $578 million on property in Texas' Eagle Ford shale. The assets total about 60,000 net acres in south Texas believed to hold oil and gas condensate, and are expected to have a net resource potential of 140-175 million barrels of oil equivalent (mmboe). SEPTEMBER 2010: * Gastar Exploration Ltd ( GST.A ) said it would sell half its interests in the booming Marcellus shale to a unit of South Korean investment firm Atinum Partners Co for $70 million. AUGUST 2010: * Rex Energy Corp ( REXX.O ) agreed to sell some of its acreage in the Marcellus shale to a unit of Japan's Sumitomo Corp ( 8053.T ) for just over $140 million. * Reliance Industries ( RELI.BO ) announced its third shale deal of the year with the acquisition of a 60 percent stake in a JV with Carrizo Oil & Gas ( CRZO.O ) in Marcellus for $392 million. JULY 2010: * Hess Corp ( HES.N ) said it would buy American Oil & Gas Inc AEZ.A in a stock deal worth about $445 million and boost its acreage in the North Dakota Bakken shale oil play.

DECEMBER 2009: * Exxon Mobil Corp ( XOM.N ) announced its plan to buy XTO Energy Inc XTO.N for about $30 billion in stock. XTO's resource base is the equivalent of 45 trillion cubic feet of gas and includes shale gas, tight gas, coal bed methane and shale oil. * Ultra Petroleum Corp ( UPL.N ) said it would pay about $400 million to an unnamed private company to buy 80,000 net acres in the Marcellus shale, giving it about 250,000 net acres and a potential for 1,800 net drilling sites. NOVEMBER 2009: * Denbury Resources Inc ( DNR.N ) said it would buy Encore Acquisition Co for $3.2 billion, creating a company with 426 mmboe in proved reserves. JUNE 2009: * BG Group paid Dallas-based EXCO $1.3 billion for an interest in shale gas resources in Texas and Louisiana.
