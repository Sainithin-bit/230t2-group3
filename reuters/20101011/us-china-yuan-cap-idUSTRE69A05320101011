 BEIJING  (Reuters) - China must set a ceiling of 3 percent for yuan appreciation this year to protect exporters, a researcher with the central bank said in remarks published on Monday. 

 China need not worry about whether U.S. lawmakers label the country as a currency manipulator and should instead halt the yuan's rise at an appropriate time, said Wang Yong, a professor at the central bank's training school in Zhengzhou, Henan province, according to the Securities Times. "This is the red line for yuan appreciation," he said, referring to a 3 percent rise. "Once the line is crossed, it means the yuan's exchange rate will be derailed from the normal track and the government should intervene in the market in a timely manner," Wang added. The yuan has risen about 2.3 percent since the central bank released the currency from a de facto peg to the dollar on June 19. Wang's view that the yuan's rise should be capped at 3 percent this year is broadly in line with a Reuters poll last month in which economists forecast that the Chinese currency would only rise another 0.9 percent this year.
