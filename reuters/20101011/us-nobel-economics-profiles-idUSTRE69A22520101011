 Here are some details about the winners: * PETER DIAMOND: -- Diamond was born in April 1940 and gained a BA in Mathematics at Yale University in 1960 and a PHD in Economics from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1963. -- Diamond was promoted to full professor in 1970 at MIT, served as head of the Department of Economics in 1985-86 and was named an Institute Professor in 1997. -- He is a member of the National Academy of Sciences and a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. -- His research has included work on government debt and capital accumulation, capital markets and risk sharing, optimal taxation, search and matching in labor markets, and social insurance. * DALE MORTENSEN: -- Mortensen was born in February 1939 and gained a BA in Economics at Willamette University in Oregon in 1961 and a PhD in Economics at Carnegie-Mellon University in Pittsburgh in 1967.
