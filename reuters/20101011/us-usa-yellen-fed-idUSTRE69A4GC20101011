 DENVER  (Reuters) - New U.S. regulations for the banking sector will help supervisors wind down large financial institutions that run into trouble, Federal Reserve Vice Chair Janet Yellen said on Monday. 

 "I believe the new tools will permit an orderly wind-down," she said in response to questions at an event sponsored by the National Association for Business Economics.
