 PARIS  (Reuters) - Some of the world's biggest exchange operators pushed on Monday for new rules that would relieve them of the intense pressure brought on by broker-run venues, with one executive tying these smaller rivals to computer-based trading techniques that provide little good. 

 The heads of London Stock Exchange Group Plc and NYSE Euronext, attending the World Federation of Exchanges conference here, repeatedly blasted the "unlevel playing field" they face when competing with alternative trading venues for today's mostly electronic buy and sell orders. Sweeping rule changes meant to spur competition over the last decade, first in the United States and soon after in Europe, spawned dozens of venues that drove down trading fees and ate away at the market share of traditional exchanges. Many, including BATS Global Markets and Chi-X Europe Ltd, are owned by big broker dealers wanting to lower trading costs. Others are so-called dark pools -- some independent, others run by banks -- where trading is done anonymously so that investors can hide their intentions from the wider marketplace. All this fragmentation has created opportunities for the most sophisticated trading firms, hedge funds, and banks to employ lightning-quick trading algorithms to earn tiny profits on price imbalances between the markets. "It is not designed to provide liquidity, it is designed to provide synchronous trading in a fragmented environment. So by definition this is a creation of the authorities," LSE CEO Xavier Rolet said in an interview on the sidelines of the conference. "They don't contribute anything other than taking little profits by ensuring that as soon as there is a deviation between one market and another, you're basically going to keep these markets in line by arbitraging away that difference," he added. NYSE Euronext's Duncan Niederauer told the conference that regulators reviewing the structure of markets on both sides of the Atlantic should tighten the requirements around the alternative trading facilities, so they are more in line with exchanges'. He said that the industry itself needs to refocus on what distinguishes it from its narrowly focused rivals: playing a vital role in capital formation, the discovery of public stock prices, and public policy. "We have to decide as an industry whether that is what we want to be -- do we just want to be trading venues?" Niederauer said. "I think that would be an unfortunate outcome for investors worldwide." He added: "The high-frequency guys are actually much more involved in the smaller venues and the dark pools, they are a much higher percentage of those venues than they are of the regulated exchanges." REGULATORS TO THE RESCUE? High-frequency traders have been under the microscope since the May U.S. "flash crash" in which the Dow Jones industrial average plunged 700 points in minutes before sharply rebounding. An October 1 regulator report said these traders helped exacerbate the fall, but did not blame them outright. High-frequency trading is estimated to be involved in more than half of U.S. stock trading volumes, and nearly half that of Europe. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has said it is considering saddling high-frequency traders with market making obligations, a move meant to ensure liquidity at difficult times. In Europe, regulation is also looking increasingly likely. "Surveillance tools should be adapted on an ongoing basis to accompany market evolutions such as high-frequency trading, both at the European and at the national levels," French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde told the conference. "We want a level playing field for every kind of trading venue," she added. Some exchanges have responded to the proliferation of high-tech, low-cost alternative venues by buying them up. The CEO of Nasdaq OMX Group Inc told Bloomberg on Monday that the exchange would consider purchasing Chi-X Europe, which said this summer that it had been approached by a possible buyer. [ID:nN11105501] A Nasdaq spokesman could not immediately be reached for comment. Five years ago, exchanges like the NYSE and LSE handled the vast majority of the trading in their listed stocks. Now, NYSE Euronext handles less than half, and LSE handles just more than half, of their respective listings. The biggest alternative venues are run by banks such as UBS AG and Morgan Stanley. In recent years, they have cropped up in Canada and parts of Asia. "I'm not saying you should turn the clock back by canceling them or getting rid of them," Ronald Arculli, chairman of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing, said of the alternative venues, sometimes called Electronic Crossing Networks in the United States and Multilateral Trading Facilities in Europe. "I think they are a fact of life today," he said. "The question is, 'how can we improve?'" (Reporting by Jonathan Spicer, editing by Matthew Lewis)
