 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Citigroup Inc ( C.N ) Chief Executive Vikram Pandit criticized new global capital rules on Monday, saying that the "reforms are headed in the right direction," but in some cases "don't go far enough" or even make the problems that led to the financial crisis worse. 

 Citigroup supports the higher capital standards under the so-called Basel III rules, which "will help keep the banking system safer," Pandit said in prepared remarks at The Economist's Buttonwood conference in New York on Monday. But he cautioned that further increases in those capital standards would have the opposite effect. "There is a point beyond which 'more' is not necessarily 'better' -- for the banking system, for consumers, or for the economy," he said. Pandit, whose company is still about 12 percent-owned by the U.S. government after three taxpayer-funded bailouts, also said that increased capital requirements could impede the economic recovery, "by raising the cost of credit precisely when credit is needed the most" and preventing many potential borrowers from qualifying for loans. The proposed Basel III rules also encourage the creation of another shadow banking system, by regulating banks but not non-bank financial companies, Pandit said. "Shifting risk into unregulated or differently regulated sectors won't make the banking system safer. On the contrary, overall risk in the system could actually rise," he said. "The new rules don't cast a wide enough net, and they create new incentives to rebuild some of the worst features of the very environment that led to the crisis." Pandit concluded by urging further, transparent debate on the proposed Basel III rules. He pointed to the lawmaking process that led to the enactment of the new U.S. Dodd-Frank financial reform law, saying it was "relatively open, transparent, and reported. Basel should be debated just like Dodd-Frank -- in the open." (Reporting by  Maria Aspan ; Editing by Steve Orlofsky)
