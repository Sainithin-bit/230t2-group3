 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - American International Group Inc Chief Executive Robert Benmosche appears to be taking on one of the toughest battles of his life in his inimitable scrappy style. 

 AIG said on Monday that its 66-year-old CEO had cancer and was undergoing "aggressive chemotherapy." Benmosche said in a statement he felt fine, although the long-term prognosis would not be clear until he had a few more months of treatment. In meantime, he told employees, it was business as usual and that he was now "even more committed to working with all of you to turn AIG into the success story we all envision." "As I have said before, I have every intention of staying at AIG and seeing that path completed," he said in a letter to employees, obtained by Reuters. "It's a turnaround I want to complete." Benmosche took over as CEO in August last year as AIG was struggling to sell assets to repay the U.S. government after receiving a $182.3 billion taxpayer-funded bailout package during the financial crisis. He stopped sales of assets that were drawing firesale prices, tried to boost employee morale, and took on AIG's critics -- including government officials -- head on. Just days after taking office, during a closed-door staff meeting in Houston, Benmosche said New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo "doesn't deserve to be in government" and had acted like a "criminal." He later said he regretted those comments, which were meant to bolster a demoralized AIG work force. TOUGH REPUTATION Benmosche, a former CEO of MetLife Inc, prides himself on a reputation for toughness. He has said he developed a scrappy, can-do approach after his father died young, leaving his mother to pay off a large debt on a family hotel in a resort town in the Catskill Mountains of New York state. "I was outspoken when I first got there and people wanted to know what kind of leader I will be," he told Reuters in an interview just days after the Houston meeting last year. Since then, Benmosche has led a surprising turnaround for AIG, bringing the insurer to a point where the government has a clear path out of its investment in the company. "Had this happened three or four months ago it would have occasioned more fright for a path forward for the organization," said Clark Troy, an analyst at Aite Group. "Now I think it's more of a question of finding the right person and concern for Benmosche personally." Benmosche, who has a head of silver hair and an imposing presence, expressed confidence about AIG's future as an independent company after announcing the exit plan deal with the government at the end of last month. "Now the debate is how much the government will make on AIG," Benmosche said. "Is it a billion, is it 10 billion? They are not talking about a $30 billion loss anymore." (Editing by  Ted Kerr )
