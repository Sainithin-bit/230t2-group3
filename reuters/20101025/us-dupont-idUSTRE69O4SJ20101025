 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - DuPont ( DD.N ) is expected to post a drop in third-quarter profit on Tuesday, but analysts continue to be bullish on the company, which operates in a wide range of industries such as chemicals, biotechnology and agriculture. 

 The improving global economy is boosting demand for the company's products, including paint and plastic for the auto market and materials to build solar panels. However, quarterly profit could be dented by DuPont's aggressive spending on research in its agricultural unit to compete with rival Monsanto Co ( MON.N ). Analysts expect earnings of 34 cents a share for the third quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, down from 45 cents a share a year earlier. The shares of DuPont, a component of the Dow Jones Industrial average, have risen about 39 percent so far this year, recently setting a two-year high. By comparison, the S&P Chemicals index has risen 8.7 percent so far this year. The resurgent U.S. auto market likely boosted sales of titanium dioxide, a key material for car paint that DuPont is currently sold out of. "We believe that, as DuPont ekes out more efficiency gains through de-bottlenecking, there is potential for further margin expansion," BB&T Capital Markets analyst Frank Mitsch said of the company's titanium dioxide business. In September, DuPont said it will hit $1 billion in solar sales this year. It previously expected to hit that mark in 2011. Executives also hope to push DuPont products into building materials, such as windows and shingles. Another positive is the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency recently approved the blending of 15 percent ethanol in fuel, up from 10 percent, a development that bodes well for DuPont's research into biobutanol, a biofuel that can also be used in car engines. However, DuPont continues to spend aggressively on research into new ways to "stack" genetic traits into seeds, which may eat into profit. Rival Monsanto posted a deeper quarterly loss than Wall Street had expected, partly due to market share gains by DuPont. Last month, Chief Executive Ellen Kullman said she was not seeing signs of a double-dip recession, a positive indicator for the broader economy. Analysts will be looking for any update on Kullman's broader economic outlook during the company's conference call, set for 9 a.m. EDT on Tuesday.
