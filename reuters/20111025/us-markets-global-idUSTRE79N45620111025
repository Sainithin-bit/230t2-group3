 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - World stocks and the euro stumbled on Tuesday after the cancellation of a meeting of European finance ministers raised doubts that an upcoming summit will result in a clear plan to rein in Europe's debt crisis. 
 A summit of European leaders remains scheduled for Wednesday but the gathering of finance ministers -- known as Ecofin -- was canceled because details of the meeting had not been finalized, sources told Reuters. Officials said euro zone leaders are unlikely to provide many hard numbers to flesh out their debt crisis response on Wednesday because the size of banks' losses on Greek bonds is still under negotiation and an increase in the firepower of the bailout fund is tough to quantify. The worries over Europe boosted safe-haven assets, driving up prices of U.S. Treasury debt and sending the Japanese yen to a record high against the dollar. Weak U.S. consumer data added to the gloomy sentiment and helped push gold up 3 percent to top $1,700 an ounce. "We are inclined to believe that the cancellation of the EU finance ministers' meeting means more delays than progress on euro area talks," said Kathy Lien, director of research at GFT in Jersey City, New Jersey. "We won't know for sure until Wednesday when the EU Summit ends and the press conference is delivered but today's announcement certainly adds a degree of uncertainty in the markets." Also on Tuesday, Germany said it opposes a phrase in a draft conclusion for the summit that calls for the European Central Bank to continue buying bonds in the secondary market. The ECB has been buying Spanish and Italian bonds for more than two months in order to hold down the countries' borrowing costs and contain the region's debt crisis. MSCI's all-country world stock index fell 1.1 percent. The index earlier hit its highest since early September on signs euro zone policymakers had neared agreement on bank recapitalization and on how to leverage the region's rescue fund. U.S. stocks ended lower, partly also weighed by a discouraging corporate outlook. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  closed down 207.00 points, or 1.74 percent, at 11,706.62. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  ended down 25.14 points, or 2.00 percent, at 1,229.05. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  finished off 61.02 points, or 2.26 percent, at 2,638.42. The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares ended 0.7 percent lower after rising to an 11-week high. Emerging market shares .MSCIEF gained 0.6 percent. SAFE-HAVEN PLAY The euro dropped 0.2 percent to $1.3897 after hitting a session low of $1.3847 on Reuters data, well off a six-week high of $1.3959. The dollar hit a record low of 75.73 yen, raising expectations of intervention to stem the yen's strength. Gold posted its biggest one-day rise since early September in a third straight session of gains that put it up 4 percent for the week. Spot gold was up 2.9 percent at $1,700.40 an ounce. Signs of discord in the euro zone weighed down Brent crude but U.S. oil prices shot higher in a second day of frenetic spread trading, as dealers raced to claw back a record discount versus Brent on mounting evidence of tightening supplies. Brent crude settled 53 cents lower at $110.92 a barrel. U.S. crude rose $1.90 to settle at $93.17 a barrel. U.S. Treasury bond prices rallied. Benchmark 10-year Treasury notes were up 1-1/32 in price for a yield of 2.12 percent. The 30-year bond was up 2-26/32, its yield falling to 3.14 percent. "U.S. Treasuries remain the strongest net bought across the board amid investor concerns that the long-standing, seemingly intractable differences amongst euro zone policy-makers remain difficult to bridge," said Samarjit Shankar, managing director of global FX strategy at BNY Mellon in Boston.
