 BRASILIA  (Reuters) - The Brazilian government is working on a program to stimulate the production of vehicles manufactured with locally-made parts, in a bid to protect industrial production and jobs, Finance Minister Guido Mantega said on Tuesday. 
 The government could make a tax on imported vehicles more flexible, Mantega said at a news conference in Brasilia, without elaborating. (Reporting by Tiago Pariz; Writing by Guillermo Parra-Bernal, Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)
