 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Canada says it will play its part in a global effort to stimulate the world economy, but Finance Minister Jim Flaherty said on Saturday he still not did foresee running a budget deficit in the current fiscal year. 

 Flaherty said he would include fiscal measures when he presents his fall fiscal and economic update in the last week of November, but it would not likely contain new tax cuts and it would also try to restrain public sector spending. He told Reuters in an interview that the country might move into a deficit as the result of future, undefined stimulus measures but that would likely only start in the fiscal year that begins April 1. "I don't expect so far at least that we will have a deficit this fiscal year," he said after a summit of the Group of 20 (G20) leading developed and developing nations. Canada is the only one of the Group of Seven big industrial countries still to have a fiscal surplus, and Prime Minister Stephen Harper said this budget position gave it more latitude than many others, especially those with structural deficits. "We will do what we have to do to contribute to boosting global demand," he told a news conference at the Canadian Embassy at the conclusion of the meeting. "We'll obviously be looking at additional (fiscal) actions ourselves." "What we've got to be sure is if we do short-term deficit spending as a deliberate policy -- if we do that; we haven't settled on doing that -- we will have to be able to demonstrate to Canadians that those deficits will genuinely be short-term and cyclical and we will come out of them quickly," he said. Still, he said Flaherty had been working carefully to try to preserve this year's balanced budget, for example limiting money paid to provinces in so-called equalization payments. The message for now appears to be that the fiscal update in late November will not be the place to look for big stimulus. 'LOOKING AHEAD' "The prime minister was looking ahead," Flaherty said. Flaherty said the G20 agreement to add stimulus might mean a deficit in future years. The minister also said the fall update and the annual spring budget were not the only times fiscal measures could be taken. One possible area could be in helping out the auto sector, although neither he nor Harper mentioned this directly in the context of stimulus. Harper said Canadian officials were talking to the United States and did not yet know what the American approach would be on rescuing the carmakers. "We cannot ignore what the Americans do. On the other hand we as a government of Canada have to ultimately take our own actions and be convinced that those actions are not just in the best interests of the auto sector but in the best interests of the Canadian economy and Canadian taxpayers," Harper said. He says state intervention runs against the Conservative grain but he wants to be pragmatic in the current situation. In general, Canada has resisted attempts by some in Europe and elsewhere to impose international regulation to prevent a similar crisis in the future, arguing that regulation should start at home. But Flaherty professed disappointment that the G20 did not require tougher rules of hedge funds than it did. "Our view is all significant pools of capital that are leveraged need to be subject to capitalization rules in particular," he said. The group only committed that hedge funds should submit "best practices" which ministers would review to see if they were adequate. The minister had mused this week about selling government assets to help its budget position, but he said he was not actively considering selling the government's 8.5 percent stake in the Hibernia offshore oil fields. He said the government was examining what options it had but that this required study. (Editing by  Eric Walsh )
