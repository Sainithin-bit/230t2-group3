 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Life and mortgage insurer Genworth Financial Inc ( GNW.N ) said on Sunday it applied for capital under a U.S. government program, after reaching a deal to buy a bank, bringing it under federal regulation. 

 With the move, Genworth joins Hartford Financial Services Group Inc ( HIG.N ), a large property and life insurer, in seeking to change its regulatory status in order to participate in the Treasury Department's $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). Genworth declined to say what amount of capital it was seeking. Hartford on Friday announced it was buying a small savings and loan, bringing it in line with a federal financial regulation requirement, and thereby making it eligible to raise up to $3.4 billion from TARP. Genworth said on Sunday it had reached an agreement in principle to buy InterBank fsb of Maple Grove, Minnesota and filed a savings and loan holding company application with the Office of Thrift Supervision, a federal regulator. InterBank is a community bank with about $1 billion in assets, according to its website. Richmond, Virginia-based Genworth has been badly battered by investment losses, and concerns that it would run short of capital. Its shares have fallen from $25.45 at the beginning of the year, to as low as $1 last week. Similar concerns over investment losses and capital shortfalls have dogged Hartford, even after it last month reached an agreement with German insurer Allianz SE ( ALVG.DE ) to inject $2.5 billion. Life insurers generally have suffered large investment losses, eating into capital levels. Several in the sector have lobbied for access to TARP, because it could give companies a way to boost capital at better-than-market rates. Earlier this month, Genworth reported a $258 million net loss for the third quarter and its operating profit missed Wall Street expectations. It also suspended a share buyback plan, withdrew a previous forecast for 2008 operating profit, and said it was exploring ways to bolster capital. The company was spun off by General Electric Co ( GE.N ) in 2004. (Reporting by  Paritosh Bansal  and  Lilla Zuill ; Editing by  Tim Dobbyn )
