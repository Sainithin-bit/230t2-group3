 PARIS  (Reuters) - U.S. President George W. Bush told this weekend's economic summit that he had received support from president-elect Barack Obama during the deliberations in Washington, France's finance minister said on Sunday. 

 "He told us that he had kept his successor regularly informed and had received his support," Economy Minister Christine Lagarde said on France 2 television. Obama did not attend the Group of 20 summit of industrial and developing nations, but advisers designated by him to meet delegates on the sidelines said he supported a coordinated response to the global financial crisis.
