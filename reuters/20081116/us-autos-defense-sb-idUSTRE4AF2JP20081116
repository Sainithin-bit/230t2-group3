 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A rescue of U.S. automakers is important both economically and for national security, retired Gen. Wesley Clark wrote in an opinion piece in Sunday's New York Times. 

 The U.S. auto industry has played an important role in successive military campaigns, from World War II to today, and its ability to continue to develop new technologies is imperative for national security, said Clark. U.S. auto makers say federal aid is vital to their survival, and there could be devastating ramifications for the broader economy if the sector is not stabilized. But a government bailout has hit stiff opposition from some, who question whether the automakers will be viable even with support. "To be sure, the public should demand transformation, and new standards in the auto industry before paying to keep it alive," said Clark, who is also a former NATO supreme allied commander. "But Americans must bear in mind that any federal assistance plan would not just be an economic measure. This is, fundamentally, about national security," Clark added. Companies such as General Motors Corp and Ford Motor Co played an important role in producing tanks and trucks, and lending technology to aircraft and shipping manufacture during World War II, said Clark. Their participation in today's military campaign in Iraq has been equally important, including the development of armor-protected vehicles, something that could not have been accomplished quickly without the efforts of the American automotive industry, he added. "More challenges lie ahead for our military, and to meet them we need a strong industrial base," said Clark, adding that among the needs are better sources of electric power in vehicles -- something troops need to monitor their radios while diesel engines are switched off, for example. "This greater use of electricity will increase combat power while reducing our footprint," said Clark. "Automakers are developing innovative electric motors, many with permanent magnet technology, that will have immediate military use," he added. Other areas where the military needs to harness the auto industry's expertise include developing an advanced battery industry in the United States, and domestic fuel cell production, which is expected to have critical military applications, said Clark.
