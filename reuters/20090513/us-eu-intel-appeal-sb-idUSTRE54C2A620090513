 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - Intel, the world's largest chipmaker, said on Wednesday it plans to appeal at Europe's Court of First Instance against a European Commission finding that it abused its dominant market position. 

 "Intel takes exception to this decision. We believe the decision is wrong and ignores the reality of a highly competitive microprocessor market," Intel President and CEO Paul Otellini said in a statement. "There has been absolutely zero harm to consumers. Intel will appeal," he added. The European Commission fined Intel a record 1.06 billion euros ($1.45 billion) on Wednesday and ordered it to halt illegal rebates to computer makers aimed at restricting their use of chips from Advanced Micro Devices. The fine is the biggest the Commission has imposed on a company for an abuse of market dominance. (Reporting by  Bate Felix )
