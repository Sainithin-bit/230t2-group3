 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japan's Panasonic Corp is likely to post a net loss of more than 100 billion yen ($1.1 billion) for the financial year ending in March 2010, the Yomiuri newspaper reported on Thursday. 

 It would be the second straight year of losses for the consumer electronics maker and almost in line with analysts' forecasts. The company is scheduled to announce its results and outlook on Friday. Seperately, the Sankei newspaper said Panasonic was likely to forecast an operating profit for this financial year but project a net loss due to costs to pull out of unprofitable operations. Pananonic has said it expects a 380 billion yen net loss for the year that ended in March. For the current year, it is expected to post a 105.4 billion yen net loss according to a poll of 17 analysts by Thomson Reuters.
