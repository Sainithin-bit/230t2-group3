 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The top four derivatives dealers in the United States -- units of JPMorgan Chase & Co ( JPM.N ), Bank of America Corp ( BAC.N ), Citigroup Inc ( C.N ) and Goldman Sachs Group Inc ( GS.N ) -- account for 94 percent of the contracts, according to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.
