 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Stocks fell around the world on Wednesday after reports of declining U.S. retail sales and falling output in Europe dimmed hopes for a rapid economic recovery, spurring demand for safe-haven assets like gold and government debt. 

 The U.S. dollar rallied against most major currencies after news of the unexpected drop in U.S. retail sales in April reminded investors of the rocky road to recovery for a global economy mired in its worst recession in decades. Oil prices slid after earlier gains as the heavy losses on Wall Street outweighed a government report showing a surprise drop in U.S. crude and gasoline stockpiles. Spot gold prices touched a six-week high above $930 an ounce on buying by exchange-traded funds and increased interest in the metal following the losses in equity markets. "Green shoots of a global recovery were hit by a round of frosty economic data today," said Vassili Serebriakov, a currency strategist at Wells Fargo Bank in New York. Major U.S. and European stock indices closed down more than 2.0 percent, while MSCI's all-country index .MIWD00000PUS was off 2.3 percent at the close on Wall Street. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  was down 184.22 points, or 2.18 percent, at 8,284.89. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  was down 24.43 points, or 2.69 percent, at 883.92. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  was down 51.73 points, or 3.01 percent, at 1,664.19. The U.S. Commerce Department said retail sales slipped 0.4 in April after a 1.3 percent decline in March. Shares in Wal-Mart Stores Inc ( WMT.N ), the world's biggest retailer and a bellwether for the retail sector, fell 1.2 percent while Macy's Inc ( M.N ) fell 6.7 percent. The department store chain stuck to its full-year outlook for a decline in sales. The S&P retail index .RLX fell 3.3 percent. European shares fell for a third straight session, led lower by financials and mining stocks, notably Rio Tinto ( RIO.L ), on investor caution after recent strong gains. Rio Tinto lost 10.6 percent amid speculation about a rights issue. The FTSEurofirst 300  .FTEU3  index of top European shares closed down 2.5 percent at 831.71 points, its lowest close since May 1. Weighing on sentiment was data showing euro zone industrial production plummeted a record 20.2 percent in March from a year ago, indicating first-quarter economic output may have shrunk more than expected. Output fell 2.0 percent from February. The Eurostat data offered little cause for optimism about economic recovery as some business surveys have suggested, while the Bank of England said Britain's recovery would be slower than previously forecast. U.S. crude fell 83 cents to settle at $58.02 a barrel, off a six-month peak above $60 hit earlier this week. London Brent fell 60 cents to $57.34. "The amazing run over the last months on building crude stocks had to come to an end," said Phil Flynn, analyst at Alaron Trading in Chicago. Oil prices have been tracking equities markets closely in recent months as traders look to stocks for signs of an economic recovery that could lift ailing world fuel demand. Crude inventories fell by 4.7 million barrels, the U.S. government said, a day after the American Petroleum Institute reported a drop in stockpiles. Analysts had forecast stocks would rise. Adding to losses, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries forecast that world oil demand in 2009 would be even weaker than previously thought. The group said members relaxed production slightly in April. The dollar, which rose from four-month lows, was up against a basket of major currencies, with the U.S. Dollar Index .DXY up 0.33 percent at 82.571. Against the yen, the dollar was down 1.16 percent at 95.29. The euro fell 0.38 percent at $1.3591. "The 'green shoots' rally was ready for a bit of a correction and we already started to see that overnight. This report is likely going to feed into it," said Michael Woolfolk, senior currency strategist at Bank of New York Mellon in New York. "This naturally gives the bond market a chance to rally." The benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose 18/32 in price to yield 3.11 percent. The 30-year long bond added 41/32 in price to yield 4.09 percent. U.S. gold futures for June delivery settled up $2 at $925.90 an ounce in New York. Overnight in Asia, Japan's Nikkei share average  .N225  edged up 0.5 percent in choppy trade. The MSCI index of Asia Pacific shares traded outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS was down 0.1 percent at Wall Street's close, after rising 0.8 percent earlier in the session.
