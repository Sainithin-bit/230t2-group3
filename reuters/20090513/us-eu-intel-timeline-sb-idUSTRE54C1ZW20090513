 (Reuters) - The European Commission fined chipmaker Intel Corp a record 1.06 billion euros ($1.45 billion) on Wednesday and ordered it to halt illegal rebates and other practices intended to squeeze out rival AMD. 

 U.S.-based Intel's central processing units power four out of five of the world's 1 billion personal computers and servers. Here are the key events in Intel's antitrust battle with the Brussels-based Commission. 2001 - The Commission launches an investigation into an AMD complaint that Intel used unfair business practices to persuade companies to buy its microprocessors. July 2007 - The Commission accuses Intel of abusing its dominant position with marketing and pricing practices that infringe EU laws. January 2008 - Intel responds to the charge sheet, known as a "statement of objections." February 2008 - The Commission inspects documents at Intel's Feldkirchen office in Germany. March 2008 - Intel responds orally to the charges at a hearing held by the EU executive. July 2008 - The Commission sends a supplementary statement of objections to Intel, accusing it of giving rebates to a major European PC retailer on condition that the firm sell only Intel-based PCs. The EU executive also files two other charges related to computer makers. October 2008 - Intel files an appeal with the Court of First Instance in Luxembourg, asking the EU's second-highest court to overrule decisions by the Commission that it says limit the evidence available to the company to conduct its defense. January 2009 - The court rejects Intel's appeal. February 2009 - Intel responds to the Commission's supplementary statement of objections. March 2009 - The Commission asks Intel for information on its global and European revenues. April 2009 - Intel provides the revenue details. May 13, 2009 - The European Commission fines Intel 1.06 billion euros and orders it to halt illegal rebates and other practices intended to squeeze out AMD.
