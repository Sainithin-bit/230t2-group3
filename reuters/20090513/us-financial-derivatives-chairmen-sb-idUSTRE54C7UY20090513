 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The chairmen of three of the four congressional committees in charge of U.S. financial regulators welcomed the Obama administration proposal on Wednesday for tougher control of over-the-counter derivatives. 

 The plan included some Capitol Hill ideas to revamp regulations, such as mandatory clearing of standardized OTC derivatives, moving standardized OTC trading onto regulated markets and trading limits on some "look alike" contracts. "We applaud the letter by Treasury Secretary (Timothy) Geithner and we agree there must be strong, comprehensive and consistent regulation of OTC derivatives," said the chairmen of the House Financial Services and House Agriculture committees. The joint statement by Financial Services Chairman Barney Frank and Agriculture Chairman Collin Peterson contrasted with analyses suggesting their panels are irreparably split on which regulator would be in charge of OTC derivatives and other salient issues in an overhaul of the regulatory structure. For example, the Agriculture Committee passed a bill on February 12 to put the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which it oversees, in charge of OTC derivatives. The bill would bar the Federal Reserve, under the jurisdiction of Financial Services, from regulating clearinghouses for OTC instruments. "Increased oversight, accountability and transparency are essential," Frank and Peterson said jointly, for a strong financial system. Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Tom Harkin said the administration proposal "is a step in the right direction and a more substantial expression of commitment to regulatory reform than we have previously seen from the administration." Details of the proposal are yet to be drawn, Harkin said, but "I look forward to working with the administration and my colleagues in Congress as we move forward on this critical issue." Harkin filed a bill in January to bring OTC trading onto public exchanges. (Reporting by  Charles Abbott ; Editing by  Jim Marshall ,  Richard Chang )
