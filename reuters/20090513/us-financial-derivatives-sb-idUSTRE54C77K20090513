 (Reuters) - U.S. regulators proposed on Wednesday regulating over-the-counter derivatives that have been blamed for worsening the financial crisis. 

 Here are the key proposals: * Amend the Commodity Exchange Act to require clearing of all OTC derivatives through regulated central counterparties * All OTC derivatives dealers and all other firms that create large exposures to counterparties should be subject to a robust regime of prudential supervision and regulation, including conservative capital requirements, business conduct standards, reporting requirements, and initial margin requirements * Amend the Commodity Exchange Act to authorize the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to impose recordkeeping and reporting requirements * Require all trades not cleared by central counterparties to be reported to a regulated trade repository * Move standardized trades onto regulated exchanges and regulated transparent electronic trade execution systems * Give market regulators clear authority to police fraud, market manipulation and other market abuses * Give the CFTC and SEC authority to set position limits on OTC derivatives that perform or affect a significant price discovery function with respect to futures markets
