 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - AT&T Inc ( T.N ) said on Wednesday it had given its "best and final" offer for a labor agreement covering about 9 percent of its employees whose contract has expired. 

 AT&T said the offer to the 27,000 Communications Workers of America members includes pension and wage increases, and keeps 401(k) contribution as well as "above-market health care." A representative of the CWA declined comment on the offer from AT&T because negotiations were still going on. The latest offer from AT&T was to workers in Texas, Missouri, Oklahoma, Kansas and Arkansas. AT&T is currently in discussions with the union for labor contracts covering a total of 80,500 of its employees. AT&T has a total employee base of about 299,000 people. Shares of AT&T were down 1.6 pct to $25.32 in noon trading on New York Stock Exchange. (Reporting by  Sinead Carew ; Editing by  Tim Dobbyn )
