 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp. ( MSFT.O ) agreed to pay up to $180 million to settle a class-action lawsuit, claiming the company has used its monopoly to overcharge citizens in the state of Iowa. 

 The judge presiding over the case in Polk County, Iowa, granted preliminary approval on Wednesday to the terms of the settlement. Microsoft announced it reached a settlement in the case in February, but did not disclose details at the time.
