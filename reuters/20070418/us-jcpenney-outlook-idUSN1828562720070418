 ATLANTA  (Reuters) - Retailer J.C. Penney Co. Inc. ( JCP.N ) on Wednesday raised its quarterly profit outlook and said it expects new stores and other improvements to drive a compound annual growth rate of 16 percent in earnings per share over the next few years. 

 The Plano, Texas, company told its analyst meeting that it expected to report earnings of $1.02 a share from continuing operations for the first quarter, which began on February 4, up from its previous outlook of 99 cents and in line with the analysts' average forecast compiled by Reuters Estimates. During its two-day analyst meeting, Penney said results through 2011 would benefit from 250 new stores and the rollout of exclusive brands such as American Living, a line of clothing and home goods by Polo Ralph Lauren Corp. ( RL.N ) Penney also said it would open its first store in New York's Midtown Manhattan, in a location near rival Federated Department Stores Inc.'s FD.N flagship Macy's. Penney said it had a net income target of about $1 billion by 2011 and forecast per-share profit of $5.44 for this year, below the analysts' average estimate of $5.48. The company, which is also launching private brands such as Ambrielle intimate apparel, said it saw total department store sales rising at an annual mid-to-high single-digit percentage rate and sales at stores open at least a year increasing in the low-to-mid single digits through 2011. Penney said it would ramp up its expansion by opening 50 stores a year annually from 2007 to 2011. It added that 80 percent to 90 percent of these new stores would not be in major malls. The company opened six stores in 2003, 14 in 2004, 18 in 2005 and 28 last year. Michael Dastugue, Penney senior vice president of property development, said the company had entered into a letter of intent to open a major store in New York's Manhattan Mall, located between 32nd and 33rd Streets on 6th Avenue, about a block away from Macy's at Herald Square. Dastugue said the J.C. Penney Manhattan store would measure about 150,000 gross square feet. Penney, which has been working to shed its dowdy its image by offering more fashionable merchandise, kicked off a new branding campaign called "Every Day Matters" earlier this year in hopes of reaching more middle-income consumers. Dastugue said Penney would complete about 300 renovations over the next five years so that 80 percent of its stores would be new or recently renovated by the end of 2011. By 2011, the retailer will have a total of about 1,200 stores. During the two-day analyst meeting, J.C. Penney executives said the company's new marketing plan and mix of private and national brand merchandise were designed to make existing customers more loyal and recruit new ones. The company said it planned to pursue profitable customers who shop Penney less frequently. It singled out shoppers of the former May Department Stores, a chain Federated bought in 2005. "We believe that some of the May Company customers most likely reside in this group and we believe there's an opportunity to capture them," Penney Chief Marketing Officer Mike Boylson said. J.C. Penney shares were down 92 cents at $80.90 in afternoon New York Stock Exchange trading. The stock has risen about 4.6 percent this year.
