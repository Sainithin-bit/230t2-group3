 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. lawmakers introduced legislation on Wednesday aimed at overhauling the patent system by weeding out bad patents and reining in excessive litigation while preserving the rights of inventors. 

 The bill, backed by many software and technology companies, would give parties more leeway to question the validity of patents before and after they are granted by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, without going to court. However, drug and biotechnology companies expressed concern about the bill, saying it could threaten work to develop new treatments for diseases. "Crafted for an earlier time, when smokestacks rather than microchips were the emblems of industry, (patent laws) have served well, but need some refinements," said Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy, a Vermont Democrat. Other supporters of the legislation include Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah, Republican Rep. Lamar Smith of Texas, and Democratic Rep. Howard Berman of California. All are senior members of the House and Senate judiciary committees. The proposed legislation also would limit damage awards in cases where an infringed patent covers only a small portion of the product. And it would change U.S. law that grants a patent to the person who can show he or she was first to come up with an invention, replacing it with a provision giving the patent to the first person to file an application for the invention. Supporters of a patent overhaul, including many companies in the computer and software industries, say the patent office sometimes grants questionable patents that lead to bogus lawsuits and excessive compensation in infringement cases. These companies complain that many patent infringement plaintiffs are "patent trolls" who don't sell any products but seek to make money by suing profitable companies and holding them to ransom. Emery Simon, a lawyer for the Business Software Alliance, expressed optimism that patent legislation would pass because of the bipartisan support from key members of Congress. "It's good for the economy, which is not partisan," Simon said. The alliance's members include Microsoft Corp. ( MSFT.O ), Apple Inc. ( AAPL.O ), IBM ( IBM.N ), SAP AG ( SAPG.DE ), Cisco Systems Inc. ( CSCO.O ), as well as computer makers Dell Inc. DELL.O and Hewlett-Packard Co. ( HPQ.N ). The patent issue caught the public spotlight last year when a small patent-holding company nearly got an injunction to shut down Research In Motion Ltd.'s RIM.TO RIMM.O popular BlackBerry wireless e-mail devices. RIM settled the case after a judge made it clear that he would impose an injunction. Patent issues got lawmakers' attention again in February when a federal jury in San Diego awarded Alcatel-Lucent ALU.PA( ALU.N ) a record $1.52 billion after concluding that Microsoft had infringed audio patents. However, efforts to overhaul the system stalled in Congress last year, in part because of reservations by pharmaceutical companies and other patent-reliant industries. Many of the provisions in earlier bills have been changed to accommodate those concerns. The chief group representing drug makers, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), acknowledged on Wednesday that reforms might be needed but balked at supporting the bill. Some provisions in the bill "may weaken the patent system in ways that could be damaging to many important and innovative sectors of the U.S. economy," PhRMA said in a statement. The group's members include major drug makers such as Pfizer Inc. ( PFE.N ), Eli Lilly & Co. ( LLY.N ), Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. ( BMY.N ), AstraZeneca Plc ( AZN.L ) and GlaxoSmithKline Plc ( GSK.L ) and Merck & Co. Inc. ( MRK.N ). Lawmakers who introduced the bills on Wednesday said they were willing to make more changes if necessary. "I am hopeful that further refinements will be made to this bill during the legislative process," said Hatch.
