 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Shares of Vonage Holdings Corp. ( VG.N ) dropped 6 percent on Wednesday after it warned in a regulatory filing of a risk of bankruptcy due to legal woes stemming from a court's finding that it infringed on Verizon Communications Inc.'s ( VZ.N ) patents. 

 The Internet phone company also cited the risk of service interruptions, an inability to repay its debt and a decline in its stock that could lead to the delisting from the New York Stock Exchange. The warning was part of its annual report filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday. Vonage shares fell 20 cents to $3.11 in morning NYSE trade. They have fallen around 82 percent from an initial public offering price of $17 last year. The filing came after Vonage was ordered last month to pay $58 million plus royalties on future sales to Verizon because of a finding that it infringed on three patents owned by Verizon. The court also barred Vonage from adding new customers, while it appealed the decision. An appeals court allowed it to continue signing up new customers ahead of a hearing to consider a permanent stay on the bar on April 24. Vonage Chief Executive Michael Snyder stepped down last week as the company said it planned to cut jobs and expenses by $30 million in 2007.
