 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Dow Jones & Co Inc DJ.N, which is increasingly reliant on digital publishing, aims to have less than half its revenue come from traditional print operations by 2009, its chief executive said on Wednesday. 

 Dow Jones, publisher of the Wall Street Journal, is one of the few newspaper companies to have successfully moved its content to the Internet, analysts say, with the Wall Street Journal Online and Marketwatch.com among its digital offerings. CEO Rich Zannino, speaking at the company's annual meeting, said he hoped to further cut the company's reliance on print publications in the coming years. Already, revenue is growing far more quickly from digital than print publications at Dow Jones. The Wall Street Journal U.S. print edition saw its advertising revenue drop 1.8 percent in the first quarter, for instance, while advertising revenue for Dow Jones Online rose 30 percent.
