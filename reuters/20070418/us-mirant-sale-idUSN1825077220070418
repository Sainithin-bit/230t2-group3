 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Independent power company Mirant Corp MIR.N said on Wednesday it has agreed to sell its Caribbean business to Japan's Marubeni Corp. ( 8002.T ) for about $732 million. 

 Mirant, which emerged from bankruptcy early last year, is also in the process of selling its Philippines assets to Marubeni and Tokyo Electric Power Co ( 9501.T ). Earlier this month, Mirant said it is exploring the option of selling the entire company. Mirant has been considered a leading takeover candidate in the power sector after a $32 billion bid by private equity groups for Texas-based TXU Corp. TXU.N boosted power asset valuations and fueled further buy-out speculations. Net proceeds from the Caribbean sale are expected to be about $565 million, said the Atlanta-based company. Mirant expects to realize a pretax gain of about $65 million. Along with the $732 million purchase price, Marubeni will assume about $350 million in debt. The deal will also include power purchase agreements of about $153 million, which will remain obligations of the Caribbean unit, and estimated working capital at closing, which is expected by midyear. "We have valued doing business in Curacao, Grand Bahama, Jamaica and Trinidad, said Chief Executive Edward Muller in a statement. "We wish the people of all four countries and Marubeni Corp. great success," he added. J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. advised Mirant in this transaction. Mirant agreed last year to sell its Philippines business for $3.4 billion. It is also selling six U.S. natural gas-fired plant for $1.4 billion to private equity firm LS Power Group. Both deals are expected to close in the second quarter. Shares of Mirant were up 2 cents at $44.97 in morning trade in the New York Stock Exchange.
