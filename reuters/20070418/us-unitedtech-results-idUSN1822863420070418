 BOSTON  (Reuters) - United Technologies Corp. ( UTX.N ) said on Wednesday strong demand for jet engines and Otis elevators, particularly from foreign markets, helped boost quarterly profit 6.6 percent. 

 The diversified manufacturer said strong growth in demand abroad, especially in Asia, and a weaker dollar more than offset the effects of a slowing U.S. housing market on its Carrier air conditioner unit and higher-than-expected raw materials prices. "Clearly, the international markets were the primary driver for the sales growth in the quarter," said Tom D'Amore, an analyst at Morningstar. "The North American economy, at least for industrial companies, is clearly growing more slowly than European and Asian economies." The Hartford, Connecticut-based company reported profit of $819 million, or 82 cents a share, up from $768 million, or 76 cents a share, a year earlier. Analysts, on average, expected profit of 81 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue came in at $12.28 billion, up 15.7 percent from $10.62 billion a year earlier. Three percent of the growth was the result of the dollar's depreciation, the company said. Sales outside the United States account for about 60 percent of United Technologies' total revenue. "Apart from the well-reported North American housing market (slowdown), commercial and residential demand worldwide remains strong," said George David, chairman and chief executive of United Technologies, in a statement. The company said international markets would be key to its forecast of 9 to 13 percent profit growth this year. "We continue to see very strong growth through the remainder of 2007, benefiting from continued strong markets for commercial aerospace and nonresidential new construction, as well as sustained growth in emerging markets around the world," said Gregory Hayes, vice president of accounting and finance, on a conference call with analysts. FOREIGN GROWTH KEY United Technologies executives said order growth in Asia, particularly China, as well as Europe was an important lift. "Having that global exposure is the thing that's propelling them," said Peter Klein, senior portfolio manager at Fifth Third Asset Management, of Cleveland, Ohio, which manages about $20 billion in assets and counts United Technologies among its holdings. "It's a very big positive." With the U.S. economy slowing, foreign sales growth also provided an important first-quarter lift to United Technologies' fellow conglomerate General Electric Co. ( GE.N ), which reported results last Friday. The dollar's =USD 2.4 percent slide against the euro this year makes U.S. company sales abroad seem higher when accounted for in dollars. HEADWINDS This year's result reflected a previously disclosed charge of 7 cents per share related to a European Commission fine against Otis for participating in a cartel that fixed prices. Commodity prices, which pinched manufacturers' margins last year, have remained a source of pressure through the opening months of 2007, Hayes said. "Commodity prices continue to surprise us," Hayes said on the conference call. He noted the company had expected commodity prices to represent about a $100 million drag on the bottom line this year, but that if current trends continue the pressure could come closer to $300 million. United Technologies affirmed its full-year profit forecast of $4.05 to $4.20 per share. For the year, analysts on average expect a profit of $4.17 per share, according to Reuters Estimates. United Technologies shares were up 53 cents, or less than 1 percent, to $66.71 in early afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. United Technologies shares trade at about 15.6 times forecast 2007 earnings, above a price-to-earnings ratio of 14.6 for the Dow Jones Industrial Average  .DJI  group of stocks.
