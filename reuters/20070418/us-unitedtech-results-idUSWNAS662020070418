 BOSTON  (Reuters) - Diversified manufacturer United Technologies Corp. ( UTX.N ) said on Wednesday strong demand for jet engines and elevators helped drive quarterly profit up 6.6 percent. 

 United Technologies, which makes products ranging from Otis elevators to Black Hawk military helicopters, reported profit of $819 million, or 82 cents a share. The company earned $768 million, or 76 cents a share, a year earlier. Analysts, on average, expected profit of 81 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue came in at $12.28 billion, up 15.7 percent from $10.62 billion a year earlier. Analysts, on average, had expected $11.47 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. "The star of the quarter was organic revenue growth," wrote Deutsche Bank analyst Nigel Coe, in a note to clients. "Top line strength was seen across the board with minor beats in each of the segments." United Technologies shares rose 83 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $67.01 on the New York Stock Exchange. "Commercial aerospace markets remain strong and Sikorsky's shipments have stepped up from last year's lower rates," said Chairman and Chief Executive George David in a statement. The company's Carrier air-conditioning unit has faced a slowing U.S. housing market over the past year, though the company said that commercial construction and demand outside the country remained strong. "Having that global exposure is the thing that's propelling them," said Peter Klein, senior portfolio manager at Fifth Third Asset Management, of Cleveland, Ohio, which manages about $20 billion in assets and counts United Technologies among its holdings. "It's a very big positive." During last year's quarter, a six-week strike at the company's Sikorsky helicopter unit reduced revenue and earnings. This year's result reflected a previously disclosed charge of 7 cents per share related to a European Commission fine against Otis. The European Commission fined Otis $295 million for participating in a cartel that fixed prices and carved up markets. Hartford, Connecticut-based United Technologies affirmed its full-year profit forecast of $4.05 to $4.20 per share. For the year, analysts expect profit of $4.17 per share, according to Reuters Estimates. At Tuesday's close, United Technologies shares traded at 15.6 times forecast 2007 earnings, above a price-to-earnings ratio of 14.6 for the Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI , of which it is a component. United Technologies in March agreed to buy the electronic security division of British services group Rentokil Initial Plc ( RTO.L ), in a deal worth about $1.2 billion.
