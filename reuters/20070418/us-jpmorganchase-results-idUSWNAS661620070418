 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co. ( JPM.N ) on Wednesday said first-quarter earnings rose 55 percent, beating forecasts, as gains in investment banking and private equity outweighed weak growth in retail banking. 

 The strong results at the bank, which also raised its dividend and authorized a new $10 billion stock buyback plan, follow better-than-expected earnings at larger rival Citigroup ( C.N ) earlier this week. JPMorgan shares were up 2.6 percent in electronic trading after the results. "The results are clearly driven by investment banking, but retail banking is challenged right now, and JPMorgan is no exception," said analyst Bill Fitzpatrick of Johnson Asset Management in Racine, Wisconsin. Net income at the No. 3 U.S. bank rose to $4.8 billion, or $1.34 a share, from $3.1 billion, or 86 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding a one-time gain from the adoption of a new accounting rule, JPMorgan earned $1.23 a share, beating the analysts' average forecast of $1.02, according to Reuters Estimates. "They've got some credit quality issues but it appears as though they've got a good handle on it," Fitzpatrick said. "I think these diversified financials can stomach it better than the pure-play regional banks." JPMorgan also said it was raising its quarterly dividend by 12 percent to 38 cents a share and authorized a new $10 billion stock buyback program. The bank bought back $4 billion in stock in the first quarter, using up most of the authorization from a prior repurchase plan from 2006, Chief Financial Officer Mike Cavanaugh told reporters on a conference call. At Tuesday's close, JPMorgan shares were up 3.9 percent so far this year, compared with a 1.9 percent decline in the KBW Banks index .BKX. JPMorgan has been focused on growth, changing course from its previous focus on cost savings from a series of previous acquisitions and mergers. Executives have said they planned to invest $1 billion in investment banking in 2007 -- about one third more than in 2006 -- to expand in markets such as energy trading in Asia. Investment banking, one of the company's strongest areas in the quarter, posted an 81 percent gain in profit to $1.54 billion, helped by strong revenue from fees. Retail banking earnings fell 2 percent to $859 million as provisions for credit losses more than tripled to $292 million from a year earlier due to higher losses from subprime mortgages and home equity loans. Cavanaugh downplayed the importance of subprime for JPMorgan, noting that it accounted for only $20 million in charge-offs. "We have subprime very well under control and are comfortable there," he said. Problems with subprime mortgages, which are targeted to less-creditworthy borrowers, have shaken many smaller lenders and even rattled larger banks like Washington Mutual Inc.  ( WM.N ) Gains on private equity investments helped JPMorgan's corporate bank swing to a $631 million profit from a $366 million loss in the year-ago period.
