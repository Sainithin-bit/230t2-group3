 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Citigroup Inc.'s ( C.N ) hedge fund chief, Dean Barr, has resigned, less than a week after the largest U.S. bank agreed to buy Old Lane LP and install Vikram Pandit as chief of its alternative investments unit. 

 The resignation was announced Wednesday in a memo to employees of Citi Alternative Investments from Lewis Kaden, the unit's interim chief executive and Citigroup's chief administrative officer. Reuters obtained a copy of the memo, and a Citigroup spokesman confirmed its contents. Barr resigned as head of liquid alternative investments, responsible for hedge funds, structured finance vehicles, credit derivative trading and other activities. He also stepped down as chief executive of Tribeca Global Management LLC, a hedge fund unit that has overseen about $2.5 billion. Barr joined New York-based Citigroup in November 2005 to build up its hedge fund business, and has served on its management committee. He previously worked at Deutsche Bank AG's ( DBKGn.DE ) Deutsche Asset Management, where he was global chief investment officer. Oliver Dobbs, the chief investment officer of Tribeca, will replace Barr at that unit, Kaden wrote. Pandit co-founded Old Lane after leaving Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ) -- where he had been chief of institutional securities -- in 2005 as part of an exodus of senior executives and traders. The Old Lane purchase is expected to close in the third quarter. Citi Alternative Investments is the smallest of Citigroup's four business units. It oversees private equity, hedge fund, real estate and other assets. In the first quarter, its net income fell 37 percent from a year earlier to $222 million, as revenue declined 17 percent to $562 million. Citigroup shares closed Wednesday up 46 cents at $52.99 on the New York Stock Exchange.
