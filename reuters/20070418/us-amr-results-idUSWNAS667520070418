 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - AMR Corp. AMR.N, parent of No. 1 U.S. air carrier American Airlines, swung to an $81 million profit on Wednesday from a year-ago loss as it filled more seats on planes, charged higher fares and paid less for fuel. 

 AMR, whose shares rose more than 2.8 percent, is the first major U.S. airline to report first-quarter results. Its profit may set the tone for the industry, which endured several high-profile, weather-related cancellations in the first three months of this year. Airlines have been battered since 2001 by terrorism concerns, low-fare competition and soaring fuel prices. In 2006, the companies started to mount a recovery, which experts predicted would continue in 2007. "This is a good omen, despite the problem in the first quarter with storms," said Ray Neidl, an analyst at Calyon Securities. Neidl said AMR's results were strong in light of a spike in oil prices, which were directly related to jet fuel prices, in March. Net profit of $81 million, or 30 cents per share, in the first quarter, compared with a loss of $92 million, or 49 cents, in the same quarter of 2006. Analysts had expected AMR to earn 31 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. "In spite of significant weather challenges, we continued to build on our momentum by generating a profit in the first quarter. This is ... the first time we have generated a profit in the first quarter since 2000," said AMR Chief Executive Gerard Arpey in a statement. Revenue increased 1.6 percent to $5.4 billion from the year-earlier period. The company estimated that weather disruptions reduced revenue by $60 million. MORE SEATS FILLED Mainline capacity -- the number of seats for sale -- in the first quarter decreased 2.5 percent compared with the same period in 2006. The percentage of total seats filled rose to a record 78.1 percent during the quarter from 77.2 percent in the year-ago period. AMR said it expects to cut mainline capacity by 1.8 percent in 2007, mainly on domestic routes, including a cut of 3.1 percent in the second quarter. American's first-quarter yield, which represents average fares, increased 3.3 percent. The carrier said the airline's costs, or mainline costs, per available seat mile rose 0.9 percent. AMR paid $1.4 billion for fuel in the first quarter, compared with $1.5 billion a year ago. Aside from cutting capacity and raising fares, AMR and its rivals have focused on cutting costs. AMR has said it plans to trim costs by $300 million in 2007. Unlike rival UAL Corp. UAUA.O, parent of United Airlines; Delta Air Lines DALRQ.PK; and Northwest Airlines NWACQ.PK, American Airlines reorganized its business outside of bankruptcy protection. AMR said it has 34 percent of its anticipated second-quarter fuel consumption capped at an average price of $2.04 per gallon and 26 percent of its anticipated full-year consumption capped at $1.96 per gallon. Last month, American Airlines said it would begin replacing its Boeing MD-80 aircraft with more fuel-efficient planes. AMR ended the quarter with $5.9 billion in cash and short-term investments, including a restricted balance of $471 million. Shares of AMR were up 82 cents, or 2.7 percent, at $31.63 in afternoon trade on the New York Stock Exchange. During the first quarter, the stock slipped 1 percent, compared with the Amex airline index  .XAL , which fell 9.8 percent.
