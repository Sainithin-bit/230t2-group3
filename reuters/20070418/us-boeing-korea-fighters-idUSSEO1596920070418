 SEOUL  (Reuters) - U.S. aerospace giant Boeing Co. ( BA.N ) was the only company to bid by a Wednesday deadline for a $2.5 billion contract to supply South Korea with 20 jet fighters by 2012, South Korea's defense procurement agency said. 

 The agency said it will open up the bidding process one more time before it decides on a manufacturer by early next year. Other companies that have expressed interest are Lockheed Martin Corp. ( LMT.N ) and the Eurofighter consortium, an agency official said.
