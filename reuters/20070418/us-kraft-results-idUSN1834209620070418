 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Kraft Foods Inc. KFT.N, the largest U.S. food company, posted lower first-quarter profit on Wednesday as it spent more on marketing to lift sales, but its shares rose 1 percent as it maintained its full-year outlook. 

 The foodmaker, whose products include Oreo cookies, Oscar Mayer lunch meat, Jell-O and Maxwell House coffee, said profit fell to $702 million, or 43 cents a share, from $1.01 billion, or 61 cents, a year earlier. Excluding the costs of a restructuring and a gain from tax reserves transferred to Kraft from Altria, earnings were 44 cents a share, topping the average analyst target of 42 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. "The numbers were pretty much in line. The expectations on the Street were that this was not going to be a great quarter," said one portfolio manager who spoke on condition of anonymity because the manager's firm was actively trading Kraft stock. "The fact that (Kraft) left the guidance intact if anything, I think, is a slight positive in the stock." MARGINS HIT Sales rose 5.7 percent to $8.59 billion, though 2.1 percentage points of the increase benefited from the weaker dollar, which raises the dollar value of sales outside the United States. Volume, a measure that excludes currency fluctuations, rose 1.2 percent, excluding acquisitions and divestitures. Operating margin fell to 14 percent from 15.2 percent, excluding one-time items, because of increased spending on marketing and "quality improvements," higher ingredient costs and the divestiture of some businesses. The company cited higher prices of green coffee, grain and cocoa. Food companies have been hit by higher costs for grain, especially corn. Corn prices have soared as more of the crop is used for ethanol. Chief Financial Officer James Dollive said the increased commodity costs were manageable for the company. But one of the tools used to combat increased costs -- price increases -- can backfire. The company sold less Oreo cookies in the quarter due to a recent price increase. Kraft, spun off from Altria Group Inc. ( MO.N ) at the end of March, plans to develop new products that combine many of its best-known brands, ramp up marketing and sharpen cost cutting. When Chief Executive Irene Rosenfeld unveiled the plans in February she suggested it could take Kraft two years to get things moving. Kraft is gaining market share in only about half of its businesses in the United States, with areas such as cheese, coffee and salad dressing losing share, Rosenfeld said during a conference call with analysts. "That's unacceptable and we are working on solutions, but it will take some time to get our shares growing," she said. MUM ON CADBURY Kraft also reiterated that it is looking for possible acquisitions to build scale in international markets, enter new categories or acquire new technologies. But Rosenfeld declined in an interview to say if Kraft was interested in chocolate and beverages company Cadbury Schweppes Plc CBRY.L, which said in March it plans to split up its sweets and drinks unit. "We look at everything and comment on nothing," Rosenfeld said. For the year the year, the company affirmed its earnings forecast of $1.50 to $1.55 a share. Excluding restructuring costs, the forecast is $1.75 to $1.80 a share. Analysts, on average, looked for $1.81 a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Kraft shares rose to $32.70 in late electronic trading after closing down 61 cents. or 1.85 percent, to $32.29 on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock is up about 2 percent since the spinoff, while the Standard & Poor's Packaged Foods Index .15GSPFOOD is up 1.8 percent.
