 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Pet food maker Menu Foods MEW_u.TO said on Tuesday it added one additional dog food product to its recall list and two more production dates of eight varieties of tainted pet food. 

 Toronto-based Menu Foods has previously recalled wet cat and dog food produced with tainted wheat gluten supplied by ChemNutra Inc. The company said the items were added after it analyzed production records at its plant in Emporia, Kansas, as part of the U.S. Food and Drug administration's investigation of tainted wheat gluten. The eight varieties had previously been withdrawn from the market and should already be off market shelves, Menu Foods said. The product added to the recall list was Natural Life dog food with a date on the bottom of the can of Nov/22/09 and UPC number of 12344-07114.
