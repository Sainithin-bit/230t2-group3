 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Motorola Inc. MOT.N posted a quarterly loss on Wednesday and offered a forecast that raised doubts over when the world's second-biggest mobile phone maker would return to profit. 

 Profit excluding special items was a penny above market expectations and helped push Motorola's beaten-down shares up 1.6 percent, but analysts focused on the company's weak outlook for the current quarter and said it likely lost market share to Nokia ( NOK1V.HE ) and other handset makers. "Profitability in phones wasn't quite as bad as expected but there's not a recovery in sight," said Charter Equity Analyst Ed Snyder. "Next quarter is quite a bit of a disappointment against consensus. Wall Street was expecting them to see some recovery next quarter." Motorola, which has been hurt by price discounts for basic phones, stiff competition in emerging markets and criticism for a stale phone line-up, also faces a proxy battle with activist investor Carl Icahn, who has a 2.9 percent stake in the company and is seeking a board seat. The company posted a first-quarter loss of $181 million, or 8 cents a share, compared with a year-earlier profit of $686 million, or 27 cents a share. Revenue fell nearly 2 percent to $9.43 billion from $9.61 billion. Excluding one-time items such as acquisition costs and a legal settlement, profit per share was 2 cents, just above analysts' forecasts of 1 cent per share, on revenue of $9.25 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. Motorola said prices, which had fallen for more than six quarters, held firm in the first quarter. Analysts said its $119 average selling price for its handsets was better than expected. The shares, which had lost about a third of their value since mid-October, rose 29 cents to $18.24 on the New York Stock Exchange as some investors were relieved average phone prices had not dipped further, one analyst said. "Probably people are looking at these things in a positive way," said Jefferies analyst Bill Choi, who sees the stock as expensive because of the disappointing second-quarter outlook. MARKET SHARE DROP Motorola forecast a second-quarter profit of 2 cents to 3 cents a share, excluding reorganization charges and other items, with sales "essentially flat" with the first quarter. Wall Street on average had expected revenue of $9.97 billion and earnings of 8 cents per share excluding unusual items, according to Reuters Estimates. Analysts estimated that Motorola's market share fell to about 17 percent from 23.3 percent in the previous quarter. It likely lost share to rivals such as market leader Nokia, set to report Thursday, and Samsung Electronics and Sony Ericsson, a venture of Ericsson ( ERICb.ST ) and Sony Corp. ( 6758.T ), Snyder said. Motorola Chief Executive Ed Zander said on a conference call that the results were unacceptable. He did not repeat the company's plan to return to double digit operating margins in the second half of the year but said it would happen in time. "Over time there is no reason why we cannot return to double digit operating earnings," Zander said. Motorola said on the conference call that it would give details of additional cost cutting by June. It had already said it would cut 3,500 jobs to reduce costs. Zander revealed a six-point plan to improving Motorola's mobile device business including cost controls and the delivery of new advanced phones later in the year and a prioritization of profitability over increasing market share at all costs. The company repeated its expectation for a full-year profit for the company overall and in the mobile unit as it sees sales and operating margins gradually improving in the second half. But analysts said it would be tough for them to recover. "I think it's going to be very difficult," said James Faucette, analyst at Pacific Crest Securities. Snyder added that Motorola's rivals would not sit still. "The environment Motorola's selling into is going to get tougher, not easier," he said. The company shipped 45.4 million handsets in the quarter, down from 65.7 million in the fourth quarter. Revenue for its mobile devices business was down 15 percent from the year-ago quarter at $5.4 billion and the unit posted an operating loss of $231 million, compared with a profit of $701 million in the year-ago quarter. Nokia's U.S. shares were down 15 cents at $23.77 on NYSE. (Additional reporting by  Ritsuko Ando )
