 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Bank of New York Co. ( BK.N ), which is buying Mellon Financial Corp. MEL.N, said on Wednesday that first-quarter profit rose 3 percent, helped by higher fees from holding securities and processing trades for institutional investors. 

 Profit topped analyst forecasts, as securities servicing fees rose 19 percent while revenue rose 20 percent in asset and wealth management, the bank's other main business. Earnings from continuing operations increased 20 percent. "The asset servicing area was a major positive," said Gerard Cassidy, a RBC Capital Markets analyst in Portland, Maine. "Asset management also grew nicely, similar to Mellon. Bottom line, the company is well positioned for the merger." Cassidy rates the bank "sector perform." Net income increased to $434 million, or 57 cents per share, from $422 million, or 55 cents, a year earlier. Excluding merger costs, profit totaled $449 million, or 59 cents per share. Earnings from continuing operations totaled $437 million, or 57 cents per share. Revenue totaled $1.9 billion and expenses were $1.27 billion, both up 19 percent. Analysts on average forecast profit of 57 cents per share on revenue of $1.9 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. Compared with the fourth quarter, revenue rose 0.5 percent and expenses fell 1 percent. "Revenue was tepid ... but was offset by better than expected cost control," wrote Merrill Lynch & Co. analyst Brian Bedell, who rates the bank "buy." Shares of Bank of New York rose 9 cents to $41.66 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Chief Executive Thomas Renyi is reshaping Bank of New York by focusing on custody services for institutional clients and asset management. In October, the bank swapped its 338-branch network for JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s ( JPM.N ) corporate trust business. Two months later, it agreed to pay $16.5 billion for Mellon to create Bank of New York Mellon Corp., the world's largest custody bank. Both companies have scheduled May 24 shareholder votes on the merger, which is slated to close around July 1. Among other custody banks, Mellon said quarterly profit rose 22 percent, while profit rose 15 percent at Northern Trust Corp. ( NTRS.O ) and 8 percent at State Street Corp. ( STT.N ). All three released results on Tuesday. SERVICING FEES RISE Fees from securities servicing increased to $990 million from $831 million a year earlier. Revenue from asset servicing, which handles transactions for mutual funds, exchange-traded funds and hedge funds, rose 17 percent to $393 million. "We've been winning and expanding (asset servicing) business across-the-board, but particularly in Europe and in the cross-border assets, with our traditional client base," President Gerald Hassell said on a conference call." Issuer services revenue, including corporate trust and depositary receipts, more than doubled to $319 million, with much of the gain attributable to the JPMorgan swap. Fees from clearing services fell 19 percent to $278 million, which the bank attributed to a spinoff of some operations into a new company, BNY ConvergEx Group. Asset and wealth management fees increased to $153 million from $127 million. Revenue rose 13 percent from foreign exchange and trading and fell 2 percent in global payment services. The bank changed from the prior quarter how it classified some sources of fee income. Through Tuesday, Bank of New York shares had risen 6 percent this year, compared with a 2 percent decline in the Philadelphia KBW Bank Index .BKX.
