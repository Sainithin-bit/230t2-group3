 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - ConocoPhillips ( COP.N ) CEO James Mulva said on Tuesday Venezuelan officials have not threatened the third-biggest U.S. oil company with taking over its projects in the vast Orinoco reserve without compensation. 

 Mulva, in an interview with Reuters, also said that talks with Venezuela over issues surrounding expropriation of assets of foreign oil companies will last "weeks or months" beyond the May 1 deadline for Caracas to take over majority ownership of fields in the Orinoco belt. Venezuelan oil minister Rafael Ramirez warned on Tuesday at an energy summit on the Venezuelan resort island of Margarita that some foreign oil companies will not be compensated once Venezuela takes over majority ownership. Mulva said he has not been given such a warning by Ramirez, whom he met on April 7 in Venezuela. The ConocoPhillips chief said company officials are in continuous talks with officials from Venezuelan national oil company PDVSA regarding the handover of majority ownership of the Orinoco assets. "The negotiation regarding the compensation and commercial terms going forward is going to go, certainly, beyond the first of May. It will take possibly weeks or months to conclude that," Mulva said. About 1 billion barrels of ConocoPhillips' 11 billion barrels of global oil reserves are in projects in Venezuela and are worth about $3 billion of the company's $175 billion asset base, Mulva said. The extra heavy crude from the Orinoco basin is seen as a key asset for Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez as he moves his oil-rich nation, an OPEC founding member, toward a socialist state. Venezuela is among the top oil exporting nations in the world, exporting about 2.25 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2005 and it is among the top five crude exporters to the United States. Governance issues including how the Orinoco fields -- estimated to have more than 200 billion barrels of heavy oil -- will be operated and how investments will be spent are key items under discussion with Venezuelan officials, said Mulva. The Houston-based company owns 50.1 percent interest in the Petrozuata heavy oil project, and PDVSA owns 49.9 percent. PDVSA wants a 60-percent share and that has not changed, Mulva said on Tuesday. In the Hamaca project, ConocoPhillips owns 40 percent, PDVSA 30 percent and Chevron ( CVX.N ) 30 percent. Mulva did not say how much PDVSA has said it wants of this project, but that any reduction in ownership by the U.S.-based firms would leave each with the same proportions they now have. Other companies with investments targeted for takeover in the Orinoco reserve are Chevron, Exxon Mobil ( XOM.N ), Norway's Statoil ( STL.OL ), Britain's BP Plc ( BP.L ) and France's Total  ( TOTF.PA ). Mulva, 60, was in Los Angeles as part of an effort by ConocoPhillips to be more expressive of its plans, particularly those regarding climate change. Mulva will meet with California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger on Thursday on many California energy issues, including efforts to cut carbon emissions and efforts to develop a terminal in Southern California that will allow for more access by crude oil tankers that are in competition for space at California ports with an increasing armada of cargo vessels, Mulva said.
