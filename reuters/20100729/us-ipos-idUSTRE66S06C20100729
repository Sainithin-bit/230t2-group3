 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A natural gas limited partnership IPO was priced at the top of the expected range on Wednesday while an investment technology platform company IPO was priced at the bottom of the range and sold fewer shares. 

 Chesapeake Midstream Partners LP CHKM.N, a natural gas limited partnership between Chesapeake Energy Corp ( CHK.N ) and Global Infrastructure Partners, sold 21.25 million units for $21 each, raising about $446.25 million. It had planned to sell units for $19 to $21 each. Envestnet Inc ( ENV.N ) makes most of its money from fees charged as a percentage of the assets that are managed on its platform but also rakes in some contract revenue. Fidelity, Envestnet's largest client, currently accounts for about a third of revenue. Envestnet sold 7 million shares for $9 each, raising about $63 million. It had planned to sell 7.7 million shares for $9 to $10 cutting the range from $12 to $14 earlier on Wednesday. The company posted a $2.69 million loss attributable to common shareholders on revenue of $21.63 million in the three months ended March 31. Rare earth oxides miner and processor Molycorp Inc ( MCP.N ) also is expected to price its IPO on Wednesday night. Chesapeake Midstream treats, compresses and transports natural gas from wellheads to third-party pipelines. Its systems consist of 2,800 miles of gathering pipelines, servicing about 4,000 natural gas wells.

The company posted net income of $34.09 million on revenue of $95.39 million on a pro forma basis in the three months ended March 31. Chesapeake Midstream's underwriters were led by UBS Investment Bank, Citi and Morgan Stanley. The shares are expected to begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday under the symbol "CHKM".
