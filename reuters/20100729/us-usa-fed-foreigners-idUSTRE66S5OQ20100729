 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Foreign central banks' ownership of U.S. Treasuries and federal agency securities rose in the latest week, data from the U.S. central bank showed on Thursday. 

 The combined holdings of Treasuries and agency securities by foreign central banks at the Fed rose by $11.42 billion to $3.151 trillion in the week ended July 28. Treasuries held by overseas central banks at the Fed rose by $10.96 billion to $2.319 trillion. Foreign central banks' holdings of securities issued or guaranteed by the biggest U.S. mortgage financing agencies, including Fannie Mae ( FNMA.OB ) and Freddie Mac FMCC.N, rose by $454 million to $831.6 billion in the latest week. Overseas central banks, particularly in Asia, have been huge buyers of U.S. debt in recent years and own more than a quarter of marketable Treasuries. Japan and China are the biggest two holders of Treasuries. The full Fed report can be found on:  here (Reporting by Chris Reese: )
