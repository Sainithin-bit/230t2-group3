 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - RadioShack Corp ( RSH.N ) reported a higher quarterly profit, in line with expectations, as the consumer electronics chain benefited from higher postpaid wireless sales and the launch of key products like Apple's iPhone 4. 

 The company, long speculated to be a takeover target, has shifted its focus to its wireless business to offset tepid sales of products like TV converter boxes, videogame systems and batteries. The Fort Worth, Texas-based chain's second-quarter net profit rose to $53 million, or 41 cents a share, from $48.8 million, or 39 cents a share, a year earlier. Analysts on average were expecting earnings of 41 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net sales rose 4.7 percent to $1.01 billion, while analysts expected $1.02 billion.
