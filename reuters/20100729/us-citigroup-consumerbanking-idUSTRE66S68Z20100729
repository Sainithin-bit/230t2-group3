 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The head of Citigroup Inc's ( C.N ) North American consumer bank plans to grow the business by focusing more on wealthy, urban clients, according to an internal memo obtained by Reuters on Thursday. 

 Manuel Medina-Mora plans to adopt and expand Citigroup's "best practices and products from around the world," including its Citigold account for affluent customers, he said in the memo. He sent the memo to Citigroup employees on Wednesday, over six months after he took over the company's North American consumer banking operations. He replaced Teresa "Terri" Dial, who stepped down in January. The Financial Times first reported on the memo on Thursday. (Reporting by  Maria Aspan ; editing by  Bernard Orr )
