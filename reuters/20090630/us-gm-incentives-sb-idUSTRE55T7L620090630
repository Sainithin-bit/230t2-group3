 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Bankrupt U.S. automaker General Motors Corp said on Tuesday it would offer zero percent financing for up to 72 months on most of its soon to be discontinued Pontiac brand and some other vehicles. 

 The automaker, which opened a U.S. Bankruptcy Court hearing into a government-brokered sale of its best assets on Tuesday, said the sale would run from July 1 to July 6 on 2009 and 2010 vehicles in dealer stock. The sale covers several Chevrolet and GMC pickups, some large SUVs, the Chevrolet Impala and Pontiac Vibe, G3, G5, G6 and G8 models. GM also is offering zero percent financing for up to 60 percent on several other vehicles. (Reporting by  David Bailey ; Editing by Phil Berlowitz)
