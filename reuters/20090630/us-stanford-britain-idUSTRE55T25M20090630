 LONDON  (Reuters) - British authorities have frozen $100 million linked to Texas billionaire and alleged swindler Allen Stanford following a request from the United States Department of Justice. 

 Britain's Serious Fraud Office (SFO) said on Tuesday it had obtained a restraining order on the assets which are believed to be held by financial institutions in London. "These funds were allegedly acquired in connection with a suspected $7 billion investment fraud scheme operated by Stanford," the SFO said in a statement. SFO Director Richard Alderman said he was determined such cross-border support for U.S. authorities became routine. "I am delighted that the SFO has been able to secure a freezing order of this magnitude and within five hours of it being requested," Alderman said. The freezing order was granted on April 7, the SFO said, adding that Britain's Crown Prosecution Service and London police had also assisted the U.S. authorities with their inquiries.
