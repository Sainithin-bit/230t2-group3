 BAGHDAD  (Reuters) - Iraq's Oil Ministry said on Tuesday it had received one bid from a consortium led by Edison EDN.MI for the 2.1 trillion cubic feet Akkas gas field. 

 Edison's partners included Malaysia's Petronas PETR.UL, China National Petroleum Corp CNPET.UL, Korea Gas ( 053000.KS ) and Turkish Petroleum Corp. The field was one of six producing oilfields and two undeveloped gas fields offered up to international energy firms in Iraq's first auction of major oil and gas contracts since the 2003 U.S.-led invasion.
