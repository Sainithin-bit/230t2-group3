 PHILADELPHIA  (Reuters) - St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank President James Bullard said on Tuesday that the danger the United States suffer a Japan-style period of sustained falling prices had eased, but had not vanished altogether. 

 "I think deflation risks are abating," he told reporters after a speech at a Global Interdependence Center event. He noted that inflation expectations implied by Treasury Inflation Protected Securities has recently risen back into positive territory, but said that financial markets still did not expect much inflation over the next couple of years. "I don't really think it has completely gone," he said. (Reporting by  Alister Bull , Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)
