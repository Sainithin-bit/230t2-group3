 (Reuters) - Belgium-based RHJ International, a former Opel suitor, moved closer to buying into the company after talks between parent General Motors and preferred bidder Magna International hit snags, the Financial Times reported. 

 Here is a summary of recent events at Opel, founded in 1863 and bought by GM in 1929: November 2008 - Opel asks Germany for state loan guarantees. March 4 - GM Europe head Carl-Peter Forster says Opel could slash 3,500 jobs and relaunch as an independent company. March 16 - Opel's hopes of getting state aid dealt a blow when a government enquiry finds it is not possible to completely separate it from GM. April 28 - Canadian-Austrian auto parts maker Magna presents outlines of an offer for Opel. May 12 - Russian carmaker GAZ confirms its interest in a joint venture with Opel and Magna. May 13 - Germany rules out temporary Opel nationalization. May 20 - GM Europe says three bids have been made; Fiat confirms it made a bid and a source says private equity investor RHJ International also made a bid. May 22 - Magna emerges as favorite after German officials say it has submitted a better plan than rival bidders. May 26 - Chinese carmaker Beijing Automotive Industry Holding Co (BAIC) emerges as a last minute contender for Opel. May 30 - Germany seals a deal with Magna, GM and the U.S. government to save Opel from the bankruptcy of its U.S. parent. -- Magna agrees to take over parts of the new European Opel activities from parent GM in a letter of intent. Germany is to provide 4.5 billion euros in loan guarantees and Magna will loan Opel 300 million euros to cover short-term liquidity needs. June 4 - Russia's Sberbank announces a 500 million euro ($708 million) cash injection for Opel. Sberbank and Magna, its partner in the winning consortium for Opel, will each commit part of the funds in proportion to their stakes. June 17 - GM and Magna have set a target of July 15 for agreeing on the sale deal, sources close to the talks say. June 26 - GM and Magna hope to close the sale of a majority stake in Opel by mid-September, an Opel supervisory board member says. -- Fiat Chief Executive Sergio Marchionne says he remains interested in a possible acquisition of Opel, since he heard talks between GM and Magna were "not going very well." But Fiat's current bid is the best it can do, he says. June 30 - Belgium-based RHJ International could sign a memorandum of understanding for an Opel deal this week, after talks between GM and Magna hit snags, the Financial Times reports. A GM Europe spokesman says talks with Magna are continuing: "It's typical in negotiations of this type that difficulties arise and we're committed to working through those difficulties to get a definitive agreement as soon as possible." The company is continuing negotiations with other potential partners including Ripplewood and Beijing Auto, the spokesman says.
