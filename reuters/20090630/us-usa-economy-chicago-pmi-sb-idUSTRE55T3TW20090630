 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Business activity in the U.S. Midwest contracted again in June but at a slightly less severe rate than expected, a report showed on Tuesday. 

 The Institute for Supply Management-Chicago business barometer rose to 39.3 from 34.9 in May. Economists had forecast the index at 39.0. A reading below 50 indicates contraction in the regional economy. The employment component of the index rose to 28.9 from 25.0 in May. Prices paid rose to 36.3 from 29.8 and new orders increased to 41.6 from 37.3. Production rose to 39.3 from 38.1. (Reporting by  Ros Krasny ; Editing by  James Dalgleish )
