 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Banks and the New York State Insurance Department are more likely to look for individual fixes for ailing bond insurers than an industrywide bailout, a person briefed on the matter said on Monday. 

 Sources last week said New York State Insurance Superintendent Eric Dinallo had pressed banks to put up cash to shore up bond insurers, whose expected losses from securities linked to subprime mortgages have mounted. Those losses are likely to trigger ratings downgrades, potentially forcing many investors to shed bonds insured by the insurers, and raising borrowing costs for city governments and individuals. Bond insurers guarantee more than $2 trillion of securities. A possible solution may in fact be for banks to provide lines of credit to the industry, the person briefed on the matter said on Monday, but at this point, the more likely solution is to selectively sort out problem companies. Bankers not involved in the deal have said that rescuing individual bond insurers may make more sense than rescuing the whole industry, since for some insurers the capital required to shore them up is not commensurate with the market harm that would ensue if the insurer lost its top rating. The New York State Insurance Department declined to comment on the matter. (Reporting by  Dan Wilchins ; Editing by  Tim Dobbyn ,  Richard Chang )
