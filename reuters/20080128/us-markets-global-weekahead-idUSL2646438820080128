 LONDON  (Reuters) - The question before investors this week will be whether a combination of government and central bank relief -- with more likely to come -- has signaled the go-ahead for a return to stocks. 

 The answer depends on whether they believe they are buying into a long-term, sustainable rally. After steep falls of 20 percent or more from 2007 peaks, many equities look cheap. There was even a hint of a rally in the latter part of last week when stock markets ended a roller-coaster ride of trading by eating up most of the sharp losses that hit earlier in the week. The S&P 500  .SPX  ended the week up 0.41 percent, having lost more than 4 percent at one stage. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 .FTEU ended down 2.07 percent for the week, but up from its earlier near 10 percent fall. Japan's Nikkei  .N225  lost 1.7 percent, but was at one point down more than 9 percent. All this came after an emergency 75 basis point cut from the Federal Reserve, a $150 billion fiscal stimulus plan from the White House and early discussions on how to bail out insurers whose underwriting of debt may yet trigger a new wave of losses. But rather than dive in, many economists and strategists are telling their firms and clients to remain cautious and that it is not yet time for a wholesale move into equities. "The concern is that any sort of rally we see is a bear market rally," said Sarah Hewin, senior economist at American Express Bank, meaning that upward moves would soon be wiped out by the general downward trend. "We may not have reached the bottom just yet. There are so many uncertainties at the moment," she said. Those uncertainties stem from the fact that the current market downturn is only partly related to equity prices and corporate earnings themselves. It is far more the result of a series of other shocks that have hit investors since mid-2007. First was the collapse of U.S. subprime mortgages and their derivatives, which spilled over in the credit market and dried up lending. That spilled over into the U.S. economy, threatening to turn a slight slowing of growth into a recession. U.S. economic woes are now threatening to drag down other economies. Debt losses are also by no means cleared away, with the focus now on insurers. "Company balance sheets are in great shape. Corporate liquidity is high. Corporate debt is low," said Bob Parker, vice chairman of Credit Suisse's asset management arm. "We haven't got the 2000-2001 corporate problems," he said, referring to the peak of the last stock market boom when firms borrowed heavily and many collapsed under the weight of paying it back as profits shrank. Parker does not expect corporate earnings growth in this corporate cycle to slow until the fourth quarter. FED TO THE RESCUE With this as a backdrop, investors have been looking to central banks and other authorities to take the steps needed to ease the underlying causes of the market turmoil -- the credit-related problems and the deteriorating U.S. economy. And it makes the Fed's meeting on Wednesday an even more crucial focus for markets that it normally is, despite the fact that it comes only a little over a week since an emergency meeting took rates down to 3.5 percent. Interest rate futures show the market is expecting another 25 or 50 basis points in cuts, possibly taking rates as low as 3.0 percent. Last week's cut, however, was not greeted with much long-lived ebullience on markets and cuts are by no means guaranteed to lift equity markets. Furthermore, the depths of some of last week's equity losses are being laid at the door of unusual position unwinding linked with Societe Generale's disclosure of a $7 billion fraud. That could mean that the end-of-week gains were simply recovering losses from a one-off event. The point for many investors may just be that the authorities are showing willingness to tackle the situation. "They will have to show action because none of the serious economic problems has been resolved. Neither the housing market nor the financial crisis has gone away," said Franz Wenzel, a senior strategist at AXA Investment Managers. WAITING GAME Bond and currency investors will be equally focused on the Fed as on equity markets themselves. Equities have been as much a driver of other markets recently as economics and policy. Yields on government bonds have fallen as investors have bought the safe-haven debt as protection against a slowing economy and a deteriorating corporate outlook. Currencies have fluctuated sharply as investors switch between high and low yielders, tracking economic sentiment that has waxed and waned along with equity prices. Both bonds and currencies are likely to remain hostage to the big picture. None of this is to suggest that investors are keeping completely away from equities. Wenzel's AXA, for example, likes what it sees as more defensive stocks in the telecoms and healthcare sectors. It also thinks that the time has come to stop selling. Parker at Credit Suisse, meanwhile, also reckons investors should be defensive and likes companies with high dividends, good cash flows and little debt. The issue is whether the worst is over for financial markets and many investors appear to think it is not. "Equities are super cheap, but I think it is going to take another two to three months for us to form a base before we get a sustained rally," Parker said. (Editing by Ruth Pitchford)
