 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Merrill Lynch & Co MER.N said on Monday co-President Ahmass Fakahany will leave the company as the brokerage builds a new management team following a credit implosion that triggered $12 billion in net losses in the second half of 2007. 

 Fakahany's departure is effective February 1. No replacement was announced. Before his promotion in May to co-president, Fakahany duties included responsibility for market risk management as Merrill's build-up of risky collateralized debt obligations surged. Exposure to the subprime-laden debt vehicles backfired. Soured CDO positions were mostly to blame for Merrill's $24 billion in write-downs last year and huge net losses. Company insiders told Reuters in late October they expected Fakahany to resign as Merrill's CDO problems mushroomed. Inside the company, he was seen as a close ally of ousted Chief Executive Stan O'Neal. Fakahany oversaw Merrill's market risk management from March 2005 until May 2007, when he was named co-president with Greg Fleming, a star investment banker at the company. Fakahany was seen as an adept administrator who played a key role in molding Merrill's tax structure and overseas growth. He joined Merrill Lynch in 1987 and served in a variety of senior roles, including chief financial officer. In a statement, Merrill Lynch Chief Executive John Thain described Fakahany as a "consummate professional." "Upon my arrival, Ahmass informed me of his intention to transition out of Merrill Lynch in the first quarter and pursue other interests," Thain said. "He provided leadership during this challenging period and has transitioned the new team." Analysts and investors blame poor risk management for Merrill's exposure to securities underpinned by risky subprime mortgages. CDOs are debt instruments that can be backed by different pools of collateral, including subprime mortgages. Fakahany was a rising star under O'Neal, who last year was ousted as chairman and chief executive after Merrill's CDO problems began to emerge. When Merrill's board ousted O'Neal in October, Fakahany's duties for overseeing business segment operations were consolidated under Fleming. At that time, Merrill Lynch insiders expected Fakahany to resign. Meanwhile, Thain has moved quickly to  bring in new senior executives to mop up the CDO mess and stabilize the company. New hires include Chief Financial Officer Nelson Chai, who worked with Thain at NYSE Euronext NYX.N, and Goldman Sachs veteran Noel Donohoe as co-chief risk officer. Merrill also has struck deals to raise up to $12.8 billion in capital, largely from foreign investors. (Reporting by  Christian Plumb ; editing by Mark Porter/Andre Grenon)
