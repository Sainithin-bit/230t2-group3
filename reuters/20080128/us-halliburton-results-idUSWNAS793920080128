 HOUSTON  (Reuters) - Oilfield services company Halliburton Co ( HAL.N ) said on Monday that fourth-quarter net profit rose 5 percent, helped by growth in the its Eastern Hemisphere markets and a lower tax rate. 

 Net income in the quarter was $690 million, or 75 cents per diluted share, compared with $658 million, or 64 cents per share, a year earlier. Revenue in the quarter was $4.2 billion, up 19 percent. (Reporting by  Anna Driver ; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn)
