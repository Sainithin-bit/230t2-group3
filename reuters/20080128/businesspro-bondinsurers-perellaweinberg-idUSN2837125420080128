 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The New York State Insurance 
Department has hired Perella Weinberg Partners to advise on 
bond insurers, a spokesman for the department said on Monday. 

  A Perella Weinberg spokesman was not immediately able to 
comment.  Bond insurers, who guarantee more than $2 trillion of 
securities, have suffered write-downs of bonds and derivatives 
linked to subprime mortgages. The losses are big enough to 
potentially trigger ratings downgrades, forcing some investors 
to sell securities guaranteed by the bond insurers.  Last week, New York State Insurance Superintendent Eric 
Dinallo met with banks to encourage them to put up cash to 
support bond insurers.  Perella Weinberg is looking at ways to protect 
policyholders of the major bond insurers, the Wall Street 
Journal reported. Some of the major insurers include MBIA Inc 
( MBI.N ) and Ambac Financial Group Inc ABK.N.  (Reporting by  Dan Wilchins ; Editing by  Braden Reddall )
