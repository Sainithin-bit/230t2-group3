 PARIS  (Reuters) - French President Nicolas Sarkozy said on Monday that highly paid Societe Generale bosses including chairman Daniel Bouton must face up to their responsibilities after a fraud scandal that has shaken the bank. 

 "When there is an event of this nature, it cannot remain without consequences as far responsibilities are concerned," Sarkozy told reporters at a visit to a university. "Everybody must think about their responsibility." Asked whether his comments referred to Bouton, Sarkozy said: "I do not want to make a personal judgment on people but when someone is highly paid, and there is a big problem, they can't duck their responsibilities." Bouton offered his resignation after the scandal emerged but it was turned down by the board. On Monday, he said the resignation offer was still on the table. Sarkozy said he hoped that the future of Societe Generale could be guaranteed. "I hope above all that we can ensure the future of this network, he said.
