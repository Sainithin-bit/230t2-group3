 PARIS  (Reuters) - Doubts are growing whether top managers at Societe Generale can survive the huge blow to their credibility from the bank's $7 billion fraud scandal and keep its successful investment banking unit growing. 

 SocGen maintains Jerome Kerviel, 31, who handed himself over to the authorities on Saturday, three days after the venerable bank unveiled the biggest investment banking fraud in history, was a low-ranking dealer who acted all on his own. But with the government openly expressing frustration at not being warned that trouble was flaring, and as public skepticism mounts over the official version of events, the bank's executive chairman, Daniel Bouton, and heir-apparent Jean-Pierre Mustier face a very uncertain future. "The old adage is you are damned if you don't know or if you do know. There is very little escape from this and it involves looking outside for new blood," said Ian Harnett, head of Absolutely Strategy, who used to work for SocGen in London. Bouton told a French newspaper over the weekend that Kerviel was able to keep one step ahead of his supervisors for months by manipulating fictitious trades and evading checks like "a mutating virus." But a growing number of people are openly challenging this account of what happened. "No one can believe one person could run up losses and that no one else would have known," said Simon Maughan at MF Global in London. "There is a real risk of this escalating a good deal further from here." NEGLIGENCE A lawyer acting on behalf of small shareholders said it was impossible Kerviel could have acted without any trace of his activities being spotted. He accuses the bank of negligence. "Traders' positions are limited according to seniority. He had a junior rank and every evening you have about 10 people involved in checking up everything that has happened," Frederik-Karel Canoy told Reuters. Canoy said it was only a matter of time before more people were drawn into the police investigation. "The investigators start with the little people and work their way up, that's how the financial police work," he said. Bouton, 57, who has run the bank for more than a decade, offered his resignation to the SocGen board last week but was asked to stay on. His predicament is compounded by the fact that Mustier, 10 years his junior and until now considered the man most likely to succeed him, has also been badly damaged by the scandal. Mustier runs SocGen's investment banking business, headquartered in Paris's flashy high-rise office district of La Defense, where Kerviel worked. The unit accounted for 40 percent of the group's net income in the first half of 2007. Mustier also led SocGen's bold expansion into financial derivatives, hiring mathematicians from elite French universities to dream up increasingly complex instruments based on futures and options contracts. "I would have thought there is more pressure on Mustier than on Daniel Bouton. It's his department and he is CEO of the Corporate and Investment Banking divisions. He would be very much in the firing line," Harnett said. Mustier confirmed in a conference call with financial journalists on Sunday that he would forego his 2007 bonus and take 50 percent salary cut. Critics say the crisis deals another blow to the confidence placed in France's highly educated power elite -- both Bouton and Mustier went to prestige schools. Anyone succeeding Mustier, if he goes, would be likely to be much more cautious about developing the derivatives business in future. The investment bank is already under pressure and sources at SocGen say that bonuses, a key part of a bank's strategy of securing high-flying staff, are already being cut. "The management that comes in will be more risk averse," Harnett said. In an interview with the Financial Times in early September, Mustier gave an upbeat message, saying he was optimistic about SocGen's investment banking business and that he expected it to carry on growing at about 10 percent a year. He also said he was confident that demand from investors for structured investment products, in which SocGen also specializes, would not be undermined by the credit-market turmoil.
