 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Alliance Data Systems Corp ( ADS.N ), a credit card transaction processor, became the latest leveraged buyout to encounter turmoil on Monday, as it said a $6.76 billion buyout by private equity firm Blackstone Group LP ( BX.N ) was in jeopardy for regulatory reasons. 

 Alliance Data shares plummeted 35 percent, or $23.12 to $42.48 by the close of trading on the New York Stock Exchange, nearly half the $81.75 per share Blackstone agreed to pay last May for the Dallas-based firm. If the merger falls apart, it would join a growing list of buyouts to collapse after last summer's tightening in credit markets, which made it more difficult and costly for private equity firms to obtain financing. But the problem with the Alliance Data deal is over regulatory issues and not a function of the price, a source familiar with the transaction said. In a statement released before the market opened on Monday, Alliance Data said the buyer notified it on Friday the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency was demanding extraordinary measures be taken that would give the buyout firm operational and financial burdens that "cannot be reasonably assumed." It said Blackstone was unwilling to satisfy the OCC requirements for the merger. Blackstone said in a statement the OCC's minimum series of requirements included "unprecedented and unacceptable financial and operational requirements that would impose an unlimited and indefinite liability" on Blackstone and its funds. These were "far in excess of any obligation" Blackstone has under the merger agreement. But it said it informed ADS that it stood ready to work with the company to complete a deal, including resubmitting its proposal to the OCC. A telephone call to the OCC was not returned. The source familiar with the deal said the regulator had asked in November for an unlimited guarantee from the buyout firm, rather than the modest guarantee that had been expected. The buyer had been working to no avail for about eight weeks to come to a mutual resolution with the OCC. Alliance Data said in its statement it believes Blackstone has the ability to close the deal and strongly disagrees with its assertions related to the OCC. It also said Blackstone's notice did not assert any breach of the merger agreement by Alliance Data. Alliance Data said its board of directors and a special committee are evaluating possible courses of action. Twice this month, Alliance Data has tried to quell market concerns about the deal by saying the buyout was not being renegotiated and it believed deal-financing remained fully committed. Alliance Data had said it was working with Blackstone to close the deal as quickly as possible. The deal agreed in May includes a break-up fee of $170 million that Alliance Data would pay the buyer under certain circumstances, such as a higher offer being received. It was also agreed that Blackstone would pay Alliance Data a fee of $170 million if the deal failed under specified circumstances. The source familiar with the deal said that, if the conditions of the merger were not satisfied by a date of April 17 and assuming there was no breach of the agreement, neither side would pay a break-up fee. DEAL NERVES SPREADS The Alliance Data deal problem had a knock-on effect on other stocks, such as U.S. radio operator Clear Channel Communications Inc ( CCU.N ), which fell 7 percent to $31.42. That is significantly below the $39.20 a share, or $20 billion deal it struck in 2007 to be bought by private equity firms Bain Capital Partners and Thomas H. Lee Partners. "I think on the heels of the Alliance Data (news) it probably made people a bit nervous (about Clear Channel)," said David Bank, RBC Capital Markets analyst. "You can't know the answer to the question unless you happen to be sitting with Bain and T.H. Lee." He added, however, that public comments from the private equity buyers had been positive. Other large buyouts that fell through include audio equipment maker Harman International Industries Inc ( HAR.N ), as the buyers said a "material adverse change" had occurred in Harman's business; and equipment renter United Rentals Inc ( URI.N ), which was blamed on uncertainty in the credit and financing markets. On Monday, Sallie Mae, the student lender known formally as SLM Corp SLM.N, said it settled a lawsuit over its $25 billion buyout, which has now been canceled.
