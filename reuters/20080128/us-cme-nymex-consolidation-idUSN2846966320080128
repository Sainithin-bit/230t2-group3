 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Top derivatives exchange CME Group Inc's CME.N $11 billion offer for energy and precious metals mart Nymex Holdings Inc NMX.N sends a clear message to the remaining smaller players in the sector: your days are numbered. 

 Pressure to expand across assets and regions has led to rampant consolidation among exchanges. That has resulted in a dwindling number of larger exchanges such as CME Group, created last year by the $9 billion merger of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT), and transatlantic NYSE Euronext NYX.N -- which is buying the American Stock Exchange. "It's a scramble to collect all the important properties -- like on a Monopoly board," said Fox-Pitt Kelton analyst Edward Ditmire. "A lot of consolidation has already happened and only a few new exchanges have been successful. The field of targets is thinning with every passing deal." If the CME-Nymex takeover happens, by many accounts the hottest remaining financial exchange target would be Atlanta- based IntercontinentalExchange Inc ( ICE.N ) -- which competes in energy derivatives with Nymex and last year made its own run at CBOT. "There was always the sense that whoever failed with CBOT would be vulnerable," said Sang Lee, managing partner of consultant Aite Group. "ICE would stand out more than ever if CME picks up Nymex." ICE, an electronic energy marketplace and soft commodity exchange, has substantial transatlantic operations and lists one of the primary global benchmarks for crude oil. The company trades at about 40 times estimated 2007 earnings per share, according to Reuters data. By comparison, Nymex trades at about 45 times estimated earnings. "ICE would have a lot of scarcity value as a derivatives platform that could be bought operating across North America and Western Europe," said Fox-Pitt's Ditmire. "The NYSE and other large consolidators such as Deutsche Bourse would definitely take a look." ICE shares closed down over 3 percent at $140.25 on Monday -- possibly on speculation ICE may counter with its own bid for Nymex, or that potential bidders for ICE were growing limited as consolidation takes its course, according to an analyst who asked to be unnamed. POSSIBLE BIDDING WAR Large exchange operators such as NYSE Euronext or Germany's Deutsche Boerse AG ( DB1Gn.DE ), which last year bought U.S. options market International Securities Exchange, could also make a bid for Nymex. "A bidding war is a definite possibility," said Lee of Aite Group. "Nymex's name has consistently come up in terms of talks with NYSE Euronext. I would definitely not be surprised to see them, or another group, step in with their own bid." Of course some exchange operators may be more concerned with digesting what is on their plate than making another deal. "It's not inconceivable that a group like NYSE Euronext would open up talks with Nymex," said Cubillas Ding of consultant Celent. "But with so many deals going on, there needs to be a focus on merger integration. I'm not sure if this will spark more deals." But as the number of targets dwindles, potential suitors may ultimately put integration on hold in the hope of snapping up another target. "The exchanges are still compelled to participate in consolidation," said Aite's Lee. "They feel that, otherwise, they could still wind up in the game -- but as a target."
