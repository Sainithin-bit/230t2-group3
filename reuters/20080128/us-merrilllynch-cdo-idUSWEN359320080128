 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Lang Gibson, a member of the team that helped Merrill Lynch & Co Inc MER.N become the No. 1 issuer of collateralized debt obligations, has resigned, people familiar with the situation said, as a CDO-related credit implosion roils banks worldwide. 

 Gibson, who headed Merrill's U.S. CDO research, resigned last week, people familiar with the situation said on Monday. Merrill Lynch declined comment. (Reporting by  Tim McLaughlin , editing by Gerald E. McCormick)
