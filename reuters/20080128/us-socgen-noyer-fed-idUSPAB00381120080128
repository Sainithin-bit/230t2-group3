 PARIS  (Reuters) - The massive fraudulent position unwound by bank Societe Generale last week did not influence the  U.S. Federal Reserve's decision to slash its rates, Bank of France Governor Christian Noyer said on Monday. 

 SocGen unwound positions totaling 50 billion euros into falling markets last week. Some market analysts have questioned whether these heavy sales played a part in the market slump -- a drop that helped convince the Fed. to cut rates last Tuesday. "Truly, I believe that this affair has nothing to do with the monetary policy of the Fed," Noyer told BFM radio. (Reporting by  Crispian Balmer ; editing by  James Mackenzie )
