 PARIS  (Reuters) - Shares in Societe Generale continued to fall on Monday on the back of the fallout from an alleged trading fraud at the French bank. 

 SocGen shares were down 3.7 percent at 71.13 euros in early morning trade, giving the bank a stock market value of around 33 billion euros ($48.35 billion). France's benchmark CAC-40 index and the DJ Stoxx European banking index were both down by roughly 2 percent. SocGen has for long been France's second-biggest listed bank by market capitalization, but its recent share price fall has meant that its market capitalization is now roughly the same as that of French rival Credit Agricole SA. U.S. investment bank Citigroup also cut its rating on SocGen to "sell" from "buy". (Reporting by  Sudip Kar-Gupta ; Editing by David Cowell)
