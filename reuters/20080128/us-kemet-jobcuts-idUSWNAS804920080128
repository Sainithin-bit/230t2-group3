 (Reuters) - Kemet Corp ( KEM.N ) said it would cut its global workforce by 385 employees, including about 120 in the United States and about 250 in Mexico, leading to annual cost reduction of about $16 million and an one-time cost of about $7 million. 

 The maker of passive electronic components also said it met trade unions to discuss restructuring plans in Italy, which could lead to 340 employees losing jobs and closure of its Vergato factory. "Meetings have also occurred between Kemet and its employees in the Towcester factory to explain Kemet's intentions to consolidate the Towcester activities into other Kemet facilities, which will affect 80 employees," the Greenville, South Carolina-based company added. These consolidations are planned to begin in June, and once fully implemented by the end of fiscal 2009 will result in annual savings of about $18 million, Kemet said.
