 LONDON/HONG KONG  (Reuters) - Incredulous derivative and equity traders still wanted answers on Monday after Societe Generale explained how a rogue trader built up a $73 billion position and caused the French bank to lose $7 billion. 

 Societe Generale said the trader, 31-year-old Jerome Kerviel, created fictitious accounts to make it look as though his unhedged positions had been covered, and falsified documents to cloak his actions. "I think most people are just astonished that someone could get away with that kind of trade for so long without being noticed," said Matt McKeith, head of equity dealing at First State Investments in Hong Kong. "I'd always be slightly suspicious of the company line in these circumstances." Derivative and equity traders were foxed by the explanation, especially since Kerviel appeared to have made no personal profit from his gamble. "It doesn't quite seem to hang together," said a London derivatives trader with several years' experience processing trades in a bank's back office, just like Kerviel. "People are still retaining a healthy sense of skepticism." Traders variously speculated whether the relatively lowly Kerviel had a grudge against the bank, or was frustrated that he could not deal in bigger volumes, or that he was a fall guy for systemic failure at SocGen, and many still questioned whether he could have acted alone. "Even a very small deal cannot go undetected for more than two days if it was not reconciled," said an equity trader in Seoul, who was not authorized to speak to the media about the matter. "It's not a matter of one trader's methods." A second derivatives trader in London who also declined to be named agreed, while acknowledging that some derivative trades were sometimes confirmed weeks after an actual deal took place. "Until it's signed, it doesn't appear within the bank as a closed trade, although it's in your book," he said. "Still, that's always flagged out to people internally. So it's all pretty weird, really." LEESON'S LESSON SocGen said Kerviel set up fictitious trades that cancelled out the risk from his huge bets on European stockmarket futures, thus covering up his true exposure to market movements. But traders said they could not understand why he was not tripped up either by a call for margin payments -- a deposit required on his positions required by the futures exchange's clearing house and recalculated daily -- or by the bank's internal system for managing its collateral. The first derivatives trader said it was the job of a bank's collateral department to aggregate the present value of all trades across the bank by counterparty. "Then you'll have a net figure positive or minus, and you'll pay or receive collateral against that number," he said. "And that happens on a daily basis, every night." Futures exchanges eliminated counterparty credit risk but were also part of the collateral management system and subject to daily margin calls direct from the exchange's clearing house. A spokesman for LCH.Clearnet in Paris, one of the world's biggest clearing houses, said it was even possible to have more than one margin call during the day. "The margin calls would be at least the amount of loss," said Francis Lun, general manager at Fulbright Securities in Hong Kong. "The long position was 50 billion euros, and if you need 5 percent coverage, that's 2.5 billion euros." SocGen, which released a note on the case at the weekend, said it covered margin calls for Kerviel's portfolio. "Insofar as these instruments were actually purchased and considered as such by Societe Generale, the margin calls were checked and settled by or paid to the bank," SocGen said. It also said the financial instruments in the portfolio were consistent with the volumes traded by a large investment bank. One dealer said SocGen's trading systems were similar to those of other banks', but several bank compliance officers contacted by Reuters declined to comment, saying they had been instructed not to discuss the case. SocGen's rogue trader has drawn parallels with Nick Leeson, who brought down Britain's Barings bank in 1995. "People had these completely opposing bits of information, and they didn't put them together," the first derivatives trader said. "It seems, if its explanation is correct, that the same thing has happened with SocGen." SocGen's version of events had to be taken at face value, mind-boggling though the size and circumstances of its loss were, the second derivatives trader said. "There is an ongoing investigation. There's going to be a lot of scrutiny, and if it turns out that they have hidden something or made it up, their reputation would be destroyed, and it's pretty shaky already," he said.
