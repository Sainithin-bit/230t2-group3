 PARIS  (Reuters) - Bank of France Governor Christian Noyer said on Monday it was not up to him to judge top executives at Societe Generale, but he praised the way the bank had unwound huge fraudulent positions last week. 

 "It is not my responsibility to pick the chairman of Societe Generale," Noyer told BFM radio. "I want to add one thing. The way Societe Generale has handled its affairs to unwind positions in a very short space of time, and without moving the markets, contrary to what has been said, because they remained within normal trading limits ... was very professional."
