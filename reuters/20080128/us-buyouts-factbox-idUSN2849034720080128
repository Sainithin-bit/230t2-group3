 (Reuters) - Tight credit markets, fears of a recession and a 
global selloff in stocks has put several planned mergers under pressure. 

 The proposed $6.76 billion acquisition of Alliance Data Systems Corp 
( ADS.N ), a credit card transaction processor, on Monday became the latest 
leveraged buyout to face possible failure. Alliance Data said its purchase by 
private equity firm Blackstone Group LP ( BX.N ) was in jeopardy for regulatory 
reasons. The first list below ranks the largest buyout deals that have been 
withdrawn since 2004, according to research firm Dealogic. The second list ranks the arbitrage spreads for some high-profile takeover 
deals, based on Monday's stock prices. Historically, the wider the spread, the 
more investors doubt a deal will close. Arbitrage spreads measure the 
difference between the offered takeover price and the target company's current 
trading price.
