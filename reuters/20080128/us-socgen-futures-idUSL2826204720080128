 LONDON  (Reuters) - Banks are re-checking their risk systems in the wake of the Societe Generale scandal and there is no need for a hasty regulatory reaction, a trade body said on Monday. 

 "We all know that banks and financial institutions will be checking and re-checking the system they already have in place," said Anthony Belchambers, chief executive of the Futures and Options Association (FOA) in a phone interview. Deutsche Bank, a member of the FOA, has been reviewing its risk management systems after the SocGen losses, a bank spokesman said at the weekend. "Everybody is double checking. Therefore, there is no need for kneejerk reactions," said Belchambers. The FOA, which has some 175 members ranging from investment houses to exchanges, expects regulators and financial institutions to tighten controls on over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives trading. "For listed derivatives, the kind of transactional flow information that goes through an exchange to its members -- margin calls, trade confirms, transactional information -- makes internal reconciliations pretty straightforward," Belchambers said. Officials at Eurex, a derivative exchange owned by Deutsche Boerse, warned SocGen, France's second-biggest bank, about junior trader Jerome Kerviel's deals in November, according to French prosecutor Jean-Claude Marin. SocGen accused the 31-year-old trader of creating fictitious accounts to make it look as though his aggressive bets that European shares would rise had been covered. The bank said the junior trader was able to cover his tracks partly because SocGen's risk systems do not check up on unregulated over-the-counter contracts straight away if no deposit is required. "If you are talking about OTC trades, you don't get all those third party information flows. They are more vulnerable to these kinds of malpractice," said Belchambers. Belchambers, however, urged regulators not to act too quickly. The UK Financial Services Authority has urged banks to reduce the backlog in trade confirmations in the OTC derivatives markets.
