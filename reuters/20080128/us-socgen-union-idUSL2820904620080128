 PARIS  (Reuters) - The CFDT union, one of the largest in France, said on Monday that it feared the weakened position of Societe Generale could lead to a bid for the bank and risked causing job losses. 

 "The staff of Societe General and the entire sector is shocked," it said in a statement, in response to the rogue trade scandal engulfing the bank. "On top of the understandable confusion of staff that see years of work reduced to nothing come the legitimate questions about the circumstances of the alleged fraud, worries about the future of the company and jobs, and uncertainties about the workings of the financial sector as a whole," it added. "The weakening of the Societe Generale raises fears of a takeover bid and creates risks for the work of 120,000 staff of Societe Generale in the world," it added. CFDT said many staff members had meantime suffered losses on their shares in the company. France's second-biggest bank was forced to unwind unauthorized trading positions amounting to some 50 billion euros ($73.63 billion) built up by the junior trader. The positions were unwound early last week as markets fell, compounding losses at a cost to the bank of 4.9 billion euros. (Reporting by  Marcel Michelson ; editing by Rory Channing)
