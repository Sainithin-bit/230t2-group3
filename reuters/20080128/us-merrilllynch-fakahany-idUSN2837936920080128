 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Merrill Lynch & Co MER.N Co-President Ahmass Fakahany is set to resign on Monday, CNBC television reported, without citing sources. 

 Fakahany oversaw Merrill's market risk management from March 2005 until May 2007, when he was named co-president with Greg Fleming, a star investment banker at the company. Merrill Lynch was not available for comment. Analysts and investors blame poor risk management for Merrill's exposure to securities underpinned by risky subprime mortgages. Merrill recorded about $24 billion in write-downs during the second half of last year, mostly because of its exposure to subprime mortgage-related assets.
