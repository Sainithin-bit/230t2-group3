 HOUSTON  (Reuters) - Oilfield services company Halliburton Co ( HAL.N ) said on Monday that quarterly net profit rose 5 percent on strength in its Eastern Hemisphere business and a lower tax rate. 

 A push to expand business in regions such as the Middle East and Asia helped offset weakness in North America, where oilfield services companies have suffered from a slowdown in drilling in Canada and falling prices in the United States in pressure pumping. Pressure pumping is used to extract oil and natural gas from hard-to-reach pockets in substances like shale. "I think it was a solid international performance," said Pierre Conner, oilfield services company analyst with Capital One Southcoast. Shares of Halliburton rose more than 2 percent, or 71 cents, to $33.80 on the New York Stock Exchange. In the Middle East and Asia, revenue soared 30 percent to $762 million, and operating income rose 25 percent to $172 million. "We will continue to grow our already strong position in the international market while optimizing our position in the U.S.," Halliburton Chief Executive Officer Dave Lesar said on a conference call with Wall Street analysts. For 2008, Halliburton forecast a 20 percent increase in revenue for its international markets, a figure in line with analyst expectations. Fourth-quarter net income increased to $690 million, or 75 cents per share, from $658 million, or 64 cents per share, a year earlier. The latest results included an after-tax charge of $22 million to write down the value of an oil and gas property in Bangladesh and $8 million in executive severance expenses, said the company, which has headquarters in Houston and Dubai. Halliburton's results topped analysts expectations for a profit of 69 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates, which initially calculated that the company had earned 77 cents on a comparable basis, but later revised that calculation to 71 cents to exclude a widely discounted tax boost. The company said it had benefited from a lower tax rate as increased international profits allowed it to recognize additional foreign tax credits. Revenue rose 19 percent to $4.2 billion, topping analysts' expectations of $4.05 billion. Operating income for Halliburton's completion and production unit fell 4 percent to $571 million, hit by higher costs and pricing weakness for some of its services in the United States. Revenue rose to $2.29 billion from $1.94 billion. In the drilling and evaluation unit, operating income rose 5 percent to $403 million, while revenue rose to $1.89 billion from $1.57 billion. Revenue in North America rose 12 percent to $1.87 billion, while operating income fell to $497 million from $535 million. Looking ahead, Halliburton said it sees pricing declines in its U.S. pressure pumping continuing in the first quarter, but said some relief may come later in the year. Still, Halliburton said it is not planning for a recovery in the Canadian drilling market in 2008. So far this year, Halliburton shares are down about 12 percent, in line with a 13 percent decline in the Philadelphia Stock Exchange oilfield services index .OSX. (Editing by Phil Berlowitz)
