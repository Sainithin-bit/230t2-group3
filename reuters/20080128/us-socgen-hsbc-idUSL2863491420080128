 PARIS  (Reuters) - Citigroup said in a research note that British-based bank HSBC might be interested in bidding for Societe Generale, the French bank hit by a rogue-trading scandal. 

 "Overall, we think HSBC would be among the most convincing bidders for SG (SocGen)," Citigroup said in the research note. The note was dated January 25 but received on Monday. "The emerging Europe focused international retail unit and the CIB (corporate and investment banking)/derivatives unit would fill two holes in the HSBC footprint." "Also, the acquisition would be manageable (HSBC market capitalization is around 3.3 times that of SG today) and given SG's low valuation the goodwill/capital impact would be relatively small," added Citigroup. HSBC bought French CCF in 2000, and Citigroup said a SocGen acquisition could fit well with HSBC's existing French operations. (Reporting by  Sudip Kar-Gupta ; Editing by Quentin Bryar)
