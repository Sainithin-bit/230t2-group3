 LONDON  (Reuters) - Derivatives exchange Eurex said its processes and control mechanisms worked at all levels, including in the case of Societe Generale's derivatives trades carried out by trader Jerome Kerviel. 

 The Deutsche Boerse owned exchange said in a statement that it was "aware of the incident concerning Societe Generale's derivatives transactions" but was unable to comment on individual participants and their trading activities. "However, we would stress that the risk management at our exchanges and at Eurex Clearing adheres to strictly defined procedures designed to ensure market integrity as well as financial security," Eurex said. "These processes and the control mechanisms at the exchange functioned correctly at all levels, also in this case." Earlier a French public prosecutor investigating the rogue trading scandal facing Societe Generale said that Eurex had warned the French bank of Kerviel's trading in November 2007.
