 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Private equity group Blackstone Group ( BX.N ) said on Monday it stands ready to work with Alliance Data Systems Corp ( ADS.N ) on a buyout of the company, after the transaction, credit and marketing services firm said the deal was in jeopardy. 

 Alliance Data earlier said the potential buyer notified it after the market closed on January 25 that it does not expect to win regulatory approval from the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency for the merger. It also said Blackstone is unwilling to satisfy OCC requirements for the merger. Blackstone said in an e-mailed statement that it stands ready to work with the company to consummate a transaction, including resubmitting its proposal to the OCC. But it said the OCC's minimum series of requirements would impose an "unlimited and indefinite liability" on Blackstone and its funds, which it said was far in excess of any obligation Blackstone has under the merger agreement.
