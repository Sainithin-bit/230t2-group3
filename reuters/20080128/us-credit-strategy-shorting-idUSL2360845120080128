 LONDON  (Reuters) - Many investors in derivatives are now hunting the best way to go short on credit based on the expectation that corporate defaults will rise this year. 

 "This year the story will be about default risk and recovery risk more than volatility," said Albert Gallo, managing director for credit derivatives strategy at Bear Stearns. "This is what investors told us in a (December) survey", with 88 percent saying they were concerned about defaults in 2008. Speculative-grade defaults globally are forecast to reach 3.8 percent, according to the median estimate in a Reuters poll, up from a historically low 1.2 percent in 2007. At the bearish end, Royal Bank of Scotland forecast 10 percent. "What is the best way to short credit over the next three to six months? This is a question we have been asked repeatedly in recent days," Lehman Brothers analysts wrote in a recent note. The simplest way to go short is to buy protection on a market index via a credit default swap. That trade has been profitable so far this year as spreads have widened on fears of a U.S. recession, but it lost money last week. Some strategists who specialize in complex credit products suggest other, more sophisticated ways to short the market for their potential to push returns higher. These strategies employ standardized tranches of three indexes -- investment-grade and high-yield debt in the United States and investment-grade in Europe. Tranches are slices of the overall portfolio with varying exposure to defaults. The riskiest slice, known as the equity tranche, is exposed to the first few defaults from any of the companies in an index. It is completely wiped out when losses reach 3 percent of investment-grade portfolios and 10 percent of the high-yield. CORRELATION "If you expect one of the names in the index to go into default, it makes sense to buy equity protection, because it gives you immediate jump-to-default exposure," said Gregorios Venizelos, a Royal Bank of Scotland structured credit strategist. "If you have a strong conviction that defaults are imminent, this is the place to buy protection," he added. He recommends the equity tranche also for an investor who wants to take advantage of a shift in correlation. Correlation is a measure of the market's fear that a few bad apples will default, which would mean losses in the equity and other lower, or junior, tranches, versus an economic cataclysm, which would extend pain to the higher, or senior, tranches. Over the credit crisis, fears about the stability of the entire financial system combined with a low default rate to mean the equity tranche gained value relative to the senior tranches. Now in what is known as a correlation trade, the investor would combine equity tranche protection with a delta hedge on the index, which removes exposure to market-wide spread moves. Lehman analysts did not include the equity tranche in their analysis, because the tranche is expensive; a change in spreads can alter its leverage, reducing its effectiveness as a short; and it requires near-term defaults to be profitable. "If you hold the equity tranche, every passing day with no defaults hurts you," said strategist Gaurav Tejwani. Instead they recommend the next tranche -- junior mezzanine -- of the high-yield indexes for investors who see defaults soon and of the investment-grade indexes for those who expect mostly slowing earnings and widening spreads for the next few months. This trade has already significantly outperformed the index since Lehman first recommended it in mid-December, Tejwani said. BEAR STRATEGY Bear Stearns analysts Gallo and Abel Elizalde say the most attractive high-yield short is a couple of steps further up the tranche ladder at the mezzanine level, which is the 25 to 35 percent loss level on the five-year U.S. high-yield. "Tranches are like options on the amount of expected portfolio losses," Gallo said. "Like an out-of-the-money option, this tranche has the potential to make the greatest return for the money." Market spreads currently imply that high-yield losses are just below the lower limit of the mezzanine tranche. As loss expectations reach the lower level, known as the attachment point, "the tranche leverage goes up a lot as everybody focuses on the at-the-money tranche, which benefits the protection buyer", Gallo said. For investment-grade indexes, Bear's strategy is completely different: Buy protection on the equity tranche, with hedges against shifts in spreads. "Investors who believe that default risk will rise in investment grade should position for a snap back up in equity premiums and a sharp drop in correlation," the analysts wrote. During the credit crisis, many hedge funds and others have sold protection on the equity tranche and hedged it by buying protection on the index, profiting as spreads have widened. But chances are increasing of a default in the U.S. index, which includes mortgage lenders and homebuilders, and defaults could easily wipe out any returns from the trade, Gallo said. "At some point, this will go wrong, and it will blow up in your face," Gallo warned. As people rush to unwind the trade, value could shift rapidly out of equity to senior tranches. Bear also recommends that investors sell protection on the higher, triple-A rated tranches, along with a delta hedge. In the crisis, prices of high tranches have dropped due to systemic fears and forced sales, but they have miniscule risk of default. "This is the best buy-and-hold trade we have," Gallo said. "At some point, people will start buying back (selling protection on) senior tranches. It's screaming to be bought."    (editing by Elizabeth Fullerton)
