 LONDON  (Reuters) - Fund managers gave a lukewarm response to the arrival of Societe Generale's chairman in London on Monday as the fraud-hit French bank went on a charm offensive for an $8 billion cash call in a sinking market. 

 Daniel Bouton was in London to tout a planned 5.5 billion euro ($8.10 billion) capital increase, which the bank will use to shore up its finances after losses of 4.9 billion euros from an alleged fraud by junior SocGen trader Jerome Kerviel. However, many said they would snub the SocGen offer. Cavendish Asset Management's Caroline Vincent said she had sold off all her SocGen shares in early January and had no plans to buy back into the stock. "I wouldn't buy, not at this moment. Not until there's full disclosure," she said. Canada Life fund manager Mark Bon also said he would not be tempted into the buying the stock for the time being. "I have held it in the past but not at the moment. We'll have to wait and see how things develop," he said. Bouton's visit to London was further overshadowed by growing questions over SocGen's handling of the affair after a Paris prosecutor said that exchange officials had warned the French bank about Kerviel's deals late last year. SocGen's capital increase is fully underwritten by JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley. The bank's board is due to meet on Wednesday and some analysts have said they expect the board to discuss details of the capital increase. However, any rights issue would take place with worldwide stock markets falling and analysts last week said they saw a rights issue being priced at 50-65 euros a share, a deep discount to SocGen's recent share price. Asked whether she would sign up to a rights issue, Stratege Finance fund manager Valerie Cazaban said: "If a rights issue were to take place today, the answer would have to be no." "We have to wait and see how this affair evolves. We also have to wait and see if management acted in good or bad faith. Management must now prove its professionalism and assume its responsibilities." Cazaban said she holds a "small amount" of SG shares. Another Paris-based trader working for a British bank said there was "huge pressure" on SocGen's capital increase since a lot of hedge funds had already sold SocGen shares short. BID TALK CIRCLES AROUND LONDON SocGen officials in Paris declined to give precise details concerning Bouton's trip to London. Many London-based institutional investors said they were unaware of any meetings being held with the French bank. A senior hedge fund manager also said he did not think Bouton had been to Mayfair, the upmarket London district that houses many powerful hedge funds. However, many working in the City, Mayfair and Canary Wharf were aware of SocGen's status as a bid target. Guy de Blonay, manager of the 330 million-pound New Star Global Financials fund, said he intends to hold on to SocGen shares partly due to hopes of a bid or break-up. "You can hold the shares because you believe some sort of corporate activity might unlock some value. There are a very defined number of interested parties who could extract benefits," he said. "At the current price, whoever buys it now could make quite a significant return on their investment straight away." "We've done back-of-the-envelope calculations and there are some players who could pay up to 75 euros a share and still make a decent return in the same year. There is an M&A (mergers and acquisitions) premium that is justifiable." De Blonay reckoned there was a good chance that SocGen's French rivals, BNP Paribas and Credit Agricole, might already be examining the situation. "We're sure BNP or Credit Agricole have been contacted by the French government. The government has a moral duty to ask a French rival to have a look if it makes sense to form a French mega bank or national champion out of the accident." He added that the two French banks could even break up SocGen with the help of a foreign partner. "There are foreign players out there who see the accident as an opportunity to strike a deal. As long as it makes sense economically, there's no reason why it shouldn't be done." "There are synergies. Let's say BNP takes the retail, Credit Agricole takes the foreign bits, even Santander could consolidate its position in Europe." (Editing by Paul Bolding)
