 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Black & Decker Corp BDK.N and Stanley Works ( SWK.N ) on Monday gave dim forecasts for 2008 as a slowdown in the U.S. housing market has stifled demand for building equipment. 

 Black & Decker, which makes DeWalt power tools and Price Pfister faucets, offered a first-quarter profit outlook that was lower than Wall Street forecasts, and Stanley Works cited a "possible mild and short-lived U.S. recession," for its full-year sales growth forecast of flat to up 1 percent. In midday trading, Black & Decker shares slipped 1.7 percent, while Stanley Works shares were up 4 percent. Investors were worried about Black & Decker due to indications that home remodeling projects were declining more than expected, but less disappointed by Stanley Works' outlook after the company had earlier tempered investors' expectations for 2008, said analyst Nicholas Heymann of investment firm Sterne, Agee & Leach. "Certainly the headwinds are more than people expected," Heymann said in reference to Black & Decker. Black & Decker, which also makes Kwikset locks, forecast earnings of $1.10 to $1.20 per share for the first quarter, while analysts surveyed by Reuters Estimates, on average, were expecting $1.40. "We recognize that the U.S. economy is slowing, and we do not expect a housing recovery in 2008," Chief Executive Nolan Archibald said in a statement. "While our international momentum and new product pipeline remain strong, we are forecasting that organic sales will decline at a low single-digit rate in 2008." The company reported a fourth-quarter profit of $187.4 million, or $2.94 per share, up from $95.7 million, or $1.38 per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, however, profit fell to $1.06 per share from $1.38. The analysts' average forecast was $1.03, according to Reuters Estimates. Sales rose 3 percent to $1.7 billion, in line with forecasts. Analyst Heymann said investors were concerned about the home remodeling outlook. When the economy slows, remodeling picks up as people renovate their homes rather than build new ones, he said. But the credit crunch is making it more difficult for homeowners to get loans. "Remodeling isn't going to be as helpful during this downturn," he said. "It's basically a bit of a shock." Additionally, Black & Decker said it sees slowing in Europe, a market which makes up 21 percent of its sales, according to a securities filing. RECESSION TALK Stanley Works, which makes carpenter's hand tools, door hardware and hydraulic tools, reported a higher fourth-quarter profit, helped by new acquisitions, but warned of deterioration in North American markets. "We're anticipating a very mild and short-lived recession ... by definition that would mean two quarters of negative GDP growth in the U.S.," James Loree, chief executive officer, said in a conference call with analysts and investors. Net income rose to $92.3 million, or $1.11 a share, from $86.6 million, or $1.03 a share, a year earlier. Analysts on average were expecting $1.07. Sales jumped 15 percent to $1.2 billion, helped by acquisitions and international demand. Stanley said it was on track to meet its 2008 profit forecast of $4.20 to $4.40 per share. Analysts are expecting $4.35. Sales growth, excluding the impact of currency translations or acquisitions, is likely to be flat to up 1 percent, the company said. The outlook includes the impact of declining home building and remodeling markets in North America. Deutsche Bank analyst Nigel Coe called Stanley Works' 2008 outlook "clearly challenging," but said the company was still executing "very solidly" in a tough environment. Shares of Stanley Works, which makes tools under the Stanley, Husky and Jensen names, were up $1.42 at $48 and Black & Decker shares were off $1.54 to $68.44, on the New York Stock Exchange. Black & Decker and Stanley Works shares are selling for 11 times next year's expected earnings, compared with an average 13.7 times forward earnings for the Standard & Poor's 500 index  .SPX , according to Reuters data. Shares of Black & Decker have lost 18 percent over the past 6 months, while Stanley Works shares have lost 13 percent. The S&P 500 has declined 8 percent. (Editing by Lisa Von Ahn, Phil Berlowitz)
