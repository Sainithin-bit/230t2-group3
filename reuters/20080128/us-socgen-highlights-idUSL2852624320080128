 (Reuters) - Below are highlights of developments in the world's biggest trading scandal at French bank Societe Generale at  12:30 p.m. EST. (*new items) 

 * French President Nicolas Sarkozy said Societe Generale bosses must face up their responsibilities. Sarkozy said the future of SocGen must be assured.  * Chairman Daniel Bouton found a lukewarm response from fund managers in London, where he is touting a planned 5.5 billion euro ($8.10 billion) capital increase to shore up bank finances.  * Shares in the bank ended down 3.3 percent after trading more than 9 percent lower during the session. - Derivatives exchange Eurex said its processes and control mechanisms worked at all levels, including in the case of derivatives trades carried out by SocGen trader Jerome Kerviel. Eurex said it could not comment on trading by individuals  - French lawyer for 100 small shareholders said he had sued Societe Generale over the way it unbundled billions of dollars in allegedly fraudulent share deals.  - Frederik-Karel Canoy said he had also filed a separate complaint about the sale of a million shares by a SocGen director of shares on January 9 and 10, disclosed in a filing. - Paris prosecutor said Eurex exchange officials had questioned deals by trader Jerome Kerviel in November 2007  - Prosecutor Jean-Claude Marin said Kerviel confessed to hiding his activities from superiors but the trader said colleagues also broke bank rules. - Marin said Kerviel concealed trades to enhance his reputation, not to hurt the bank. The prosecutor said he had requested that Kerviel be held in temporary detention. - Bank of France Governor Christian Noyer said on Monday that he was informed of the crisis on Sunday, January 20 but delayed informing the government until the following Wednesday because he wanted to avoid the danger of leaks as the bank sold the position on the market.  - He also said decision to unwind a 50 billion euro ($73 billion) position taken by the trader was "probably" the only one possible. - The massive fraudulent position did not influence the U.S. Federal Reserve's decision to slash rates, Noyer said.  - French Economy Minister Christine Lagarde said there was no need for Societe Generale to merge with another bank.  - SocGen Chairman Bouton told Europe 1 radio station that an offer he had made to resign in light of the bank's trading scandal "remained on the table."  - Citigroup analysts said the bank's franchise was "severely impaired" and cut Societe Generale to a "sell" rating from buy.
