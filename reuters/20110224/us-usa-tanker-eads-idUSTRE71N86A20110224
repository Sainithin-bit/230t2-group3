 PARIS  (Reuters) - Airbus parent EADS expressed "disappointment and concern" at losing a bid to supply tankers to the U.S. Air Force but said the contract was "one business opportunity among many" in the United States. EADS North America said in a statement that it had good technology that would be invaluable to U.S. military forces. 

 The Pentagon said earlier that Boeing had won a fiercely contested contract worth over $30 billion to build refueling planes for the Air Force, beating out Europe's EADS. The EADS statement gave no indication whether the company would exercise its right to appeal the decision.
