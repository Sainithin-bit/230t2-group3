 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Boeing Co said on Thursday it is making headway toward certification of its long-delayed 787 Dreamliner, with nearly 80 percent of the conditions met for the first model featuring Rolls-Royce engines. 

 The company said it has completed more than 60 percent of the test conditions required by aviation regulators for the 787s with General Electric engines. The light-weight, carbon-composite airplane is nearly three years behind its original schedule. Boeing aims to deliver the first 787 in the third quarter of 2012. Boeing said it made its 1,000th test flight of the 787 on Wednesday and the plane "continues to behave well in testing." Earlier on Thursday, Wedbush Securities analyst Kenneth Herbert said in a research note that flight testing for the 787 was on track to meet its delivery target. Shares of Boeing were up 59 cents at $70.82 on the New York Stock Exchange. (Reporting by Kyle Peterson; Editing by Steve Orlofsky)
