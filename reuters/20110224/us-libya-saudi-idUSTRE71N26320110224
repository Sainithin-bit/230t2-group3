 RIYADH/LONDON  (Reuters) - Top world oil exporter Saudi Arabia is in talks with European companies affected by the disruption in Libyan supply and is willing and able to plug any gaps in supply, senior Saudi sources said on Thursday. 

 Oil industry sources said Saudi officials have been in touch with Spanish and Italian oil firms -- among those hit by the Libyan shutdowns. The companies were assessing their needs and have yet to ask for any more Saudi oil. The Saudi sources said Saudi Arabia was able to pump more of the kind of high-quality crude produced by OPEC member Libya and that it could be shipped quickly to Europe with the help of a pipeline that crosses the kingdom. Oil prices have surged toward $120 a barrel because of the unrest and disruption to supply in Libya. Refineries in Europe import about 80 percent of Libya's 1.3 million barrels per day (bpd) of exports, analysts say. "We are in active talks with European refineries to find out what quality they want and we are ready to ship it as soon as they need it. This is the way buyers and sellers work. We need to find out what they want before we take any action," a senior Saudi source told Reuters. "Some OPEC countries have started looking at ways to divert their crude to Europe." Analysts have said the loss of virtually all Libya's production is particularly serious because it is high-quality and easy to refine, in contrast to the heavier crudes often associated with OPEC countries. But the Saudi sources said the kingdom had the right kind of crude available. "Saudi is willing and capable of supplying oil of the same quality, either Arab Extra Light or through blending," one of the sources said. QUALITY ISSUES Industry sources said European oil companies have yet to ask for more Saudi oil and were also doubtful whether Saudi crude would be a suitable alternative because of quality differences. Spain's Repsol and Italy's Eni are among the oil companies working in Libya that have had to slow or shut their Libyan oil output. "If you need, ask and we will consider it," an industry source said Saudi officials had told his company. "We are evaluating the situation at the moment. It is not a matter of quantity, more of quality." While Saudi Arabia had indicated a willingness to supply extra oil, it has not specified the particular crude grades that may be on offer or the quantities, or how long any arrangement to pump more would last. "There is nothing very concrete," said one of the industry sources. Another industry source said Saudi Arabia had large amounts of light crude, although he added state oil company Saudi Aramco had not yet issued new instructions to increase the rate of pumping. For European customers, the advantage of Libya is that it is only a short journey away across the Mediterranean. The Saudi sources said Saudi Arabia could shorten the journey time for its crudes by shipping them through its East-West pipeline and then to the Mediterranean and on to Europe. Some West African OPEC crude, such as from Angola could also be redirected to Europe, the sources said, while Saudi Arabia temporarily could send extra oil to Asia to compensate. Despite the Saudi moves, OPEC has yet to make any changes to its formal output policy. Saudi Arabia said at talks this week the oil market was still adequately supplied, but it was always ready to tap some of its roughly 4 million bpd of spare capacity on to the markets in the event of a shortage. The kingdom and other members of OPEC -- some of whom have smaller amounts of unused capacity -- have held bilateral talks with big customers this week and EU sources said European Commission experts were in contact with OPEC. OPEC has held its formal output policy steady since December 2008 when it agreed to a record supply curb of 4.2 million bpd. As prices and demand have risen, OPEC has unofficially increased the amount it produces.
