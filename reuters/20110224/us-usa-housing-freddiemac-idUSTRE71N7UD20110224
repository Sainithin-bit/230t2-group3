 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - A top executive at mortgage finance giant Freddie Mac ( FMCC.OB ) received a "Wells Notice" from the Securities and Exchange Commission that the agency was considering filing an enforcement action against him, according to an SEC filing released on Thursday. 

 The filing said Executive Vice President Donald Bisenius, who heads the single-family mortgage unit, may have violated federal securities laws and related rules in 2007 and 2008. (Reporting by  Corbett B. Daly  and  Rachelle Younglai ; Editing by Leslie Adler)
