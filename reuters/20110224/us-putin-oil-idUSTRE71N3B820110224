 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - Surging oil prices, now at their highest since August 2008, threaten world economic growth, Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin said on Thursday. 

 "Today, Brent reached $118 (per barrel). This is, of course, a serious threat to economic growth in the world," he told a briefing in Brussels. Russia is the world's largest oil producer and a major exporter. But Putin, speaking after meeting European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso, said Russia would be hurt if foreign demand were crushed by high prices. "We understand that if the world's economic growth starts to slow down, this will badly influence our economy," he said, citing estimates from analysts that oil could spiral to $220 per barrel. "That's why we will do everything, in contact with our European partners, not to allow such a negative development." Oil surged more than 7.5 percent to its highest since August 2008 on Thursday on concern unrest in Libya could spread to other major oil producers in the Middle East, including Saudi Arabia. Brent crude futures for April spiked by $8.54 per barrel to a peak of $119.79 before easing back to around $115.00. Putin said unrest in North Africa and the Middle East underlined the importance of Russia as a reliable supplier of energy, and in particular natural gas, to Europe. He took aim at EU energy rules, known as the third energy package, that impose limits on the ownership of EU pipeline infrastructure by gas suppliers, saying they were tantamount to "confiscation." Such restrictions would hand a role to intermediaries in the gas trade, resulting in higher prices to end users, Putin said. He nonetheless predicted that the EU and Russia would eventually reach an understanding on the matter. "It is in the long-term interest of our European partners that supplies are stable," Putin said. "We intend to prove the superiority of our position." (Reporting by Darya Korsunskaya; writing Vladimir Soldatkin and Douglas Busvine; editing by Toni Vorobyova)
