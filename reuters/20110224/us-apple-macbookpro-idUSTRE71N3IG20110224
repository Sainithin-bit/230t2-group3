 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Apple Inc released its new lineup of MacBook Pro notebook computers, which will run twice as fast as the previous generation and feature a new high-definition video camera and improved graphics. 

 The new MacBook Pros will be powered by the latest dual-core and quad-core chips from Intel Corp. Intel also supplied the MacBook Pro with a faster, compact input/output technology called Thunderbolt, which supports high-resolution displays and devices through a single port. The price of a 13-inch MacBook Pro, with a full-size keyboard, seven-hour battery life and an aluminum casing, will start at $1,199. The 15-inch starts at $1,799 and the 17-inch is priced at $2,499.
