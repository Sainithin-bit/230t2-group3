 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The governors of Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana wrote President Barack Obama on Thursday in support of a bid by Europe's EADS to build 179 refueling planes for the U.S. Air Force, saying the company's bid would provide a needed boost for the Gulf Coast region. 

 In the letter, the governors insisted that Airbus parent EADS would build the new A330-based tanker planes in Mobile, Alabama -- not Europe as supporters of the rival Boeing Co bid have said. "This will create a much-needed economic ripple effect across a Gulf Coast region still reeling from natural and man-made disasters," said the letter, signed by Alabama Governor Robert Bentley, Mississippi Governor Haley Barbour and Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal.
