 TOKYO  (Reuters) - The Bank of Japan on Friday offered to inject a further 3 trillion yen ($37 billion) into the banking system, joining efforts to restore market calm as G7 nations agreed to act jointly to stem sharp yen rises. 

 The offer came on top of 34 trillion yen already offered in same-day operations this week in the aftermath of last week's devastating earthquake and tsunami that hit northeast Japan. The fund supply will boost current account deposits financial institutions hold with the BOJ to 34.2 trillion yen, the biggest since February 2006 -- the period when the central bank was pursuing its quantitative easing policy that targeted the amount of funds in the financial system.
