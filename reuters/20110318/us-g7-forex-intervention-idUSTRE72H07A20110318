 TOKYO  (Reuters) - The Group of Seven advanced nations will intervene jointly in the foreign exchange markets at the request of the Japanese authorities struggling with the yen's rise and a deepening nuclear crisis, finance chiefs from the group said on Friday. 

 The G7 finance chiefs held a teleconference around 7 a.m. Japan time on Friday (10:00 p.m. GMT on Thursday) to discuss the financial and economic impact of last week's massive earthquake and unfolding nuclear crisis. Japan would intervene in dollar/yen markets from 12:00 a.m. GMT on Friday, Japanese finance minister Yoshihiko Noda said. Traders spotted the Bank of Japan buying dollars. The dollar spiked 2 yen to above 81 yen after the statement. KEY POINTS: -- G7 said authorities from the United States, United Kingdom, Canada and European Central Bank will join in the joint intervention from March 18 -- BOJ Governor Masaaki Shirakawa said the central bank will continue power monetary easing -- The G7 issued a statement saying they will continue to monitor FX markets closely COMMENTARY: NAOKI IIZUKA, SENIOR ECONOMIST, MIZUHO SECURITIES, TOKYO: "This is a strong stance by global governments and central banks that they cannot tolerate volatile forex moves. "It seems that they want to keep the yen from firming beyond 80 yen and as long as dollar/yen stays in its range of before the quake, around 80-85 yen, there may not be additional intervention. But if the yen firms again below 80 yen, there will probably be either joint intervention or sole intervention by Japan, which the international community would tolerate. "Japan's government and the BOJ are responding quickly to the micro economy, considering their implementing joint intervention with other nations, the central bank providing ample liquidity and more easing steps. "The most pressing issue is fixing the nuclear problems and securing electric power or alternative energy for Japan. If we see such kinds of news, the markets' focus will return to normal such as the U.S. jobs data and its monetary policy." MITSURU SAHARA, CHIEF FX MANAGER, BANK OF TOKYO-MITSUBISHI UFJ, TOKYO: "It is a positive surprise because market expectations were for the statement to just suggest their readiness to intervene, not an actual intervention accompanying the statement right away or naming specific central banks that are participating. "The impact will be there, as it is difficult now to sell the dollar below 80 yen. It is good timing before the Japanese three-day weekend, given fears that the yen could test fresh highs against the dollar on Monday when Japan markets will be closed. It is also good timing as much of the positions below 80 yen had been cleared (by yesterday's dollar/yen drop). "The question is whether this is a smoothing operation, or with an aim to follow up with successive interventions to prop up dollar/yen higher. I think it is aimed at preventing a sharp plunge and bringing dollar/yen back up to levels before it started plunging, rather than trying to push it higher above 85 yen. I don't expect follow-up interventions to the upside. "With the effect of the intervention, the market may enter into a range between 80-82 yen sooner than expected." IMRE SPEIZER, WESTPAC BANK SENIOR STRATEGIST, WELLINGTON: "It was as clear as it could be and it was huge. They said they will intervene and the whole world will intervene. This is much bigger than before earlier expected." "It came out of Bank of Japan. This is huge and it's having commercial effect. There can be a lot more upside in dollar/yen before the next 24 hours is over "Global coordinated intervention is very rare, but when it occurs it is usually very successful." KOJI FUKAYA, CHIEF CURRENCY ANALYST, CREDIT SUISSE, TOKYO "The intervention is expected to be powerful and effective as it is a rarely seen joint effort, instead of Japan going at it alone. The yen could weaken to as much as 82 or 83 yen against the dollar due to the BOJ's accommodative stance. The financial markets should regain some calm -- for example the Nikkei is rising -- as they see a bottom for the dollar." STEPHEN ROBERTS, ECONOMIST, NOMURA, SYDNEY: "That's good news. "It (intervention) will have a very good chance of working. The market was fearing large scale repatriation and there hasn't been much evidence of that. The fear was probably overblown in the first place and now with central banks intervening they have got very good chance of success." DAVID FORRESTER, CURRENCY STRATEGIST AT BARCLAYS CAPITAL, SINGAPORE: "There are three reasons that is going to make it effective: This is a joint market action, it is conspicuous in its timing and it is across currencies. What is lacking however is the size of the proposed intervention and the fact that markets were expecting something along these lines. Hence the positioning was a bit light going into this. "In terms of dollar/yen, it is probably going to remain around 79-80 levels for about a while, unless we go above 81.50/60 which is around the levels it broke down on Monday. If it goes back above those levels then we will see more upside in dollar/yen. "Intervention is designed to slow things down. The move down in dollar/yen was quite sharp and historically intervention is designed to slow things down rather than mark a turning around point. VASSILI SEREBRIAKOV, CURRENCY STRATEGIST, WELLS FARGO, NEW YORK: "It's certainly very significant from G7 in that it marked the first coordinated action on currencies in over 10 years. "It's a surprise relative to market expectations. There was some anticipation of perhaps verbal support for Japan, or for unilateral intervention from Japan, but multilateral action on currencies is very significant by the standards of recent G7 meetings. "We have already seen some confirmation that the Bank of Japan and Ministry of Finance have intervened. It appears that other central banks may follow. The reaction is dollar/yen, while notable, is still perhaps not as strong as one would expect given the significance of the move. So in the short run, we can see some further yen weakness." FREDERIC NEUMANN, CO-HEAD OF ASIA ECONOMICS RESEARCH, HSBC, HONG KONG: "This is a huge surprise. Joint intervention by G7 central banks will tie in the Japanese Yen. This also suggests that the Bank of Japan my further expand its monetary easing program, increasingly buying risky assets. "Announcing before intervening is a normal sequence if international coordination is involved. This provides a bigger bang for the buck "Markets may doubt the effectiveness of individual central banks' intervention, but if several central banks step into the market in a coordinated fashion it will undoubtedly have an effect. "But the real news here is not necessarily the coordinated FX intervention, but the Bank of Japan's indication it will possibly expand asset purchases including buying of reconstruction bonds. It's not clear yet, whether the Bank of Japan will sterilize its asset purchases, but it appears that the Bank of Japan is embarking gradually on quantitative easing." KATHY LIEN, DIRECTOR OF CURRENCY RESEARCH, GFT, NEW YORK: "This is the first coordinated intervention that we have seen since 2000 so it's going to have a very huge resonating effect on the market. Because the only type of intervention that actually works is coordinated intervention and it shows the solidarity of all central banks in terms of the severity of the situation in Japan." "Because it's coordinated intervention, I do think that it's enough to basically to cement a bottom in dollar/yen as well as the other yen crosses." JOHN WOODS, CHIEF ASIAN STRATEGIST, CITI PRIVATE BANK, HONG KONG: "A powerful - albeit somewhat surprising - statement committing the G7 to coordinated intervention. Given the circumstances I see it as entirely appropriate, reflecting the devastation caused by the earthquake and tsunami" ROBERT RYAN, FX and INTEREST RATE STRATEGIST, BNP PARIBAS, SINGAPORE: "We think this joint action was warranted as Japan was clearly running out of options at this point with further fiscal spending likely to hurt confidence in the JGB market. "In the medium term, I think they will try to hold dollar/yen around these levels and not let it go below the 80 mark. Once investors become convinced that authorities have put a floor around that level, that may encourage them to seek higher yields elsewhere. But for a significant rise in dollar/yen, we must wait for the 2nd half of the year when the U.S. economy will start to turn around." ROBERT RENNIE, CHIEF CURRENCY STRATEGIST, WESTPAC BANK "We've not seen coordinated intervention from central banks for many  years. Intervention is more successful when it's coordinated, and that clearly is the case here. Intervention is also more successful when it works hand-in-hand with monetary policy and that's the case here. The BoJ earlier announced it would buy reconstruction bonds from the MOF, this is essentially QE. The last thing Japan needs right now is a significantly stronger yen and this is a very important message." ROB HENDERSON, CHIEF MARKETS ECONOMIST AT NATIONAL AUSTRALIA BANK "It was a strong statement, I didn't quite expect a coordinated intervention right now. The objective was to lower the yen and that's exactly what they've got." HIDENORI SUEZAWA, CHIEF STRATEGIST, NIKKO CORDIAL SECURITIES, TOKYO: "Because the surge in the yen was due to the crisis, the United States and Europe understood Japan's need for intervention in the foreign exchange market. "We can expect some impact from intervention, with 80 yen against the dollar and 110 yen against the euro as psychological levels. But the stabilization of the nuclear reactor situation and concrete recovery plan are needed for financial market stability. "JGB moves are limited after the announcement as yields haven't fallen much in the past few days amid cautions over the Japanese government's fiscal position. Stock and forex markets are reacting more strongly as their moves were much sharper than JGBs' after the earthquake." BACKGROUND: -- The yen surged to a record high against the dollar of 76.25 yen on trading platform EBS this week. On Friday morning in Asia, dollar/yen was trading around 79.30 yen before the G7 statement and suspected dollar-buying by the Bank of Japan pushed it above 81. -- The yen has seen steady buying since last week's earthquake, as Japanese and international investors closed long positions in higher-yielding, riskier assets such as the Australian dollar, funded by cheap borrowing in the Japanese currency. -- Expectations that Japanese insurers and companies will start bringing money home to pay for claims and reconstruction may also have helped boost the yen. -- Japan is scrambling to avert a catastrophic release of radiation at a stricken nuclear plant where fuel rods are overheating, following last week's devastating earthquake and tsunami that killed at least 10,000 people. -- The G7 comprises Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and United States.
