 (Reuters) - The shutdown of a quarter of Japan's refining capacity and 11 of its 54 nuclear reactors following Friday's earthquake and tsunami has boosted global prices for fuel and natural gas. 

 The expectation of higher Japanese demand for diesel and fuel oil has boosted refinery margins as well as differentials for crudes that yield a high amount of distillates. Differentials for fuel also rose on expectations of higher Japanese imports. In addition, natural gas prices rose on forecasts Japan's demand for liquefied natural gas(LNG) would increase for power generation. Below are details of the impact on energy markets: NATURAL GAS * UK gas for summer delivery rose 8 percent on Monday, hitting 64.60 pence per therm at 1400 GMT. Spot gas was up 7 percent at 63.50 pence, the highest since a December cold snap boosted gas heating demand. * U.S. natural gas futures traded up nearly 4 percent in early activity, before erasing gains on expectations that milder weather in the United States would limit demand. 7] REFINED PRODUCTS * Front-month Asia gas oil crack premium eased 85 cents to $23.16, as Japan's supply crunch looked set to ease after the country managed to secure around 4.5 million barrels of oil products from South Korea and a few refineries boosting output to plug the country's supply gap after last week's earthquake and tsunami. * Asian jet fuel's prompt crack lost $1.05 to $24.31 a barrel, while its premium to gas oil slipped 20 cents to $1.15 a barrel. * Fuel oil's prompt crack weakened $1.44 to a discount of $10.46 a barrel. * Profits from refining Brent crude into naphtha - continued to recover $3.55 to $110.70 a tonne premium. * The spread or crack between ICE gas oil and Brent futures moved to a 26-month high of nearly $17 a barrel as the market anticipated higher demand for distillates and fuel oil from other regions in the wake of the Japanese earthquake and tsunami. * European low-sulphur fuel oil barge prices rose to 30-month highs on Monday as traders anticipated the country would need alternative power sources due to nuclear plant closures. * U.S. Gulf Coast jet fuel and ultra-low sulfur diesel each rose more than a cent per gallon in early Monday trade on expectations of more exports to Japan. * Diesel differentials in the Los Angeles market climbed 2 cents a gallon. PHYSICAL CRUDE * The premium of Nigerian Qua Iboe to benchmark dated Brent stayed near a the 32-month high of around $4 that was reached on Friday, according to Reuters data. * The premium on Nigeria's other benchmark Bonny Light over Brent also hovered around $4, a level last reached in July 2008. * Azeri Light, already buoyed by the supply disruption in Libya, saw its premium to dated Brent rise further to around $3.75. The Azeri crude differential has pushed steadily higher from around $1 in November 2010. * The differential on Brent to dated Brent was just below $1, a level last reached in January this year.
