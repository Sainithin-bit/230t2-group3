 TOKYO  (Reuters) - The Bank of Japan likely spent around 2 trillion yen ($25.4 billion) intervening in the currency market in the morning, Jiji news agency quoted a market source as saying on Friday. 

 Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda said Japan would buy dollars for yen from the outset of Tokyo's trading on Friday, although he did not say how much Tokyo was planning to spend on intervention. (Reporting by  Leika Kihara ; Editing by  Nathan Layne )
