 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. Bancorp, one of the 10 biggest banks in the United States, boosted its annual dividend by 150 percent and said it was buying back stock after receiving regulatory approval to return capital to shareholders. 

 The bank said it did not expect to buy back many shares until it knows the final capital guidelines under Basel III, which are expected to come out later this year. The Federal Reserve on Friday approved plans for several major banks to start returning capital to shareholders, in the latest sign that the banking system is recovering from the financial crisis. U.S. Bancorp said it was boosting its annual dividend to 50 cents a share, up from its current 20 cents. The bank also said its board approved its repurchasing up to 50 million shares of its outstanding common stock. As of Jan 31, it had about 1.92 billion shares outstanding.
