 FRANKFURT/BELGRADE  (Reuters) - The European Central Bank said it had begun intervening in euro/yen currency markets on Friday, in an action dubbed exceptional by an ECB policymaker. 

 "We confirm the ECB took part in the joint foreign exchange intervention mentioned in the G7 statement," an ECB spokesman said. ECB Executive Board member Gertrude Tumpel-Gugerell said later in Belgrade the current situation required drastic action, the first time in a decade there has been a joint currency intervention. "ECB has participated in the current action," Tumpel-Gugerell said at the Serbian central bank. "Exceptional times require exceptional actions."
