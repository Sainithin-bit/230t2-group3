 BOSTON  (Reuters) - Bank of New York Mellon said it planned to increase its dividend and resume share repurchasing after getting approval from the Federal Reserve. 

 The New York-based bank did not indicate how much it would increase its dividend. "We are pleased that, after a review of our capital plan, the Fed has no objection to the execution of our plan to return capital to our shareholders by increasing our dividend and resuming our share repurchase program," Chief Executive Officer Robert Kelly said in a statement. The announcement came as JPMorgan Chase & Co, Wells Fargo & Co and other large U.S. banks announced plans to boost their dividend payments after passing the Federal Reserve's second round of stress tests.
