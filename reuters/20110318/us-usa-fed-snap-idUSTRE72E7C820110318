 (Reuters)- The U.S. Federal Reserve on Tuesday held its monetary policy steady but said the economy was on a firmer footing. 

 Some key points on changes in the statement: * The Fed sounds more upbeat about the economy than in January. It said it now considers the economic recovery is "on a firmer footing". * Policymakers are more optimistic about the U.S. labor market. * The Fed is no longer qualifying the growth in household spending. Last meeting it noted four issues that were constraining household spending. * It adds a number of references to rising commodity prices and says this is putting upward pressure on inflation. * It expects these effects to be "transitory" but reassures that it is paying attention to inflation and inflation expectations. * It now calls underlying inflation "subdued". At the last meeting it said it was "trending downward." Below is a side-by-side comparison of the U.S. central bank's March 11 and January 26 policy statements. Fed policymakers changed the following words: MARCH: Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in January suggests that the economic recovery is on a firmer footing and overall conditions in the labor market appear to be improving gradually. JANUARY: ... met in December confirms that the economic recovery is continuing, though at a rate that has been insufficient to bring about a significant improvement in labor market conditions. MARCH: Household spending and business investment in equipment and software continue to expand. JANUARY: Growth in household spending picked up late last year, but remains constrained by high unemployment, modest income growth, lower housing wealth, and tight credit. Business spending on equipment and software is rising. MARCH: Commodity prices have risen significantly since the summer, and concerns about global supplies of crude oil have contributed to a sharp run-up in oil prices in recent weeks. Nonetheless, longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable, and measures of underlying inflation have been subdued. JANUARY: Although commodity prices have risen, longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable, and measures of underlying inflation have been trending downward. MARCH: Currently, the unemployment rate remains elevated, and measures of underlying inflation continue to be somewhat low, relative to levels that the Committee judges to be consistent, over the longer run, with its dual mandate. JANUARY: Currently, the unemployment rate is elevated, and measures of underlying inflation are somewhat low, relative to levels that the Committee judges to be consistent, over the longer run, with its dual mandate. MARCH: The recent increases in the prices of energy and other commodities are currently putting upward pressure on inflation. The Committee expects these effects to be transitory, but it will pay close attention to the evolution of inflation and inflation expectations. The Committee continues to anticipate a gradual return to higher levels of resource utilization in a context of price stability. JANUARY: Although the Committee anticipates a gradual return to higher levels of resource utilization in a context of price stability, progress toward its objectives has been disappointingly slow.
