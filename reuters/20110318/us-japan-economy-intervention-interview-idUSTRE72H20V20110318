 (Reuters) - The Group of Seven rich nations are ready to "act decisively" again if currency market speculation persists, Japanese deputy finance minister Fumihiko Igarashi said on Friday after the G7 agreed to intervene together to restrain the soaring yen. 

 Igarashi told Reuters in an interview he was satisfied with the impact the rare joint action had on Japanese markets, helping boost stocks and weakening the yen. The G7 show of solidarity came as a surprise to many because Tokyo had indicated it was looking for moral support for its attempts to calm markets while it scrambled to prevent a meltdown at a nuclear plant rather than concerted intervention. "The yen's rise was driven by speculators," Igarashi, one of the finance minister's two deputies, said. "If we caved into such speculators that took advantage of people's misfortunes, the Japanese economy would be ruined and the whole world economy would be harmed," he said. The U.S. dollar surged two full yen to as much as 81.83 yen, leaving behind a record low of 76.25 hit on Thursday as the Bank of Japan kicked off the joint action. Media reported it bought more than $25 billion. Asked how much Japan spent on its yen-selling intervention, Igarashi said he was not sure how much it has amounted to. Japan's Nikkei share index climbed nearly 3 percent, recouping some of the week's stinging losses as Japan reeled from an earthquake, tsunami and the nuclear power plant crisis. The last time the G7 agreed on joint intervention was a decade ago to turn a slumping euro following its 1999 launch. The G7 comprises Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and United States. (Reporting by  Tetsushi Kajimoto  and Yuko Yoshikawa; Editing by  Tomasz Janowski )
