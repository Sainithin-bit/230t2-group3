 TOKYO  (Reuters) - The Group of Seven rich nations agreed on Friday to join a rare concerted intervention to restrain a soaring yen to help Japan cope with the triple blow of a massive earthquake, a tsunami and a nuclear crisis. 

 Following are Japanese officials comments on the decision. FINANCE MINISTER YOSHIHIKO NODA: "In the teleconference we discussed the impact of the earthquake on the economy and markets, and movements in the financial markets. At the beginning I expressed my gratitude toward other countries and international organizations for expressing their regrets and sympathies and providing various support. "I also stressed that the Japanese society has maintained order and calm despite the difficult situation, and that the Japanese economy remains sound and we are tackling this situation with strong will." "Based on the agreement, the government and the Bank of Japan will conduct intervention in the foreign exchange markets from 9 a.m. Other authorities will act in concert in their own times in sync with Japan's move. When Japan is in such a state, it's extremely meaningful for G7 countries to cooperate and take coordinated action to stabilize financial markets." Asked whether the intervention was targeting the dollar/yen rate, Noda said: "Yes, that's right." "(The intervention) is basically in dollar/yen, but in some cases the ECB may do it in euro. But I cannot say definitely." On the possibility of BOJ underwriting bonds issued for post-quake reconstruction. "A cautious debate would be needed on whether to have the Bank of Japan directly underwrite JGBs. The 20-year bond auction has been conducted smoothly so the market is smoothly digesting JGBs. I'm aware that various people have various opinions on this, but the government is not specifically considering it." ECONOMY MINISTER KAORU YOSANO: "G7 made a right decision at the right time...We won recognition internationally that the yen's stability is important. "Excessive currency volatility negatively affects consumer sentiment. The significance of intervention is to limit share price and currency moves to within markets' expectations. "After all, the foreign exchange market is expected to settle at levels that reflect economic fundamentals." BANK OF JAPAN GOVERNOR MASAAKI SHIRAKAWA: "The BOJ expects cooperation with other countries will help stabilize the currency market. "The BOJ will promote powerful monetary easing and continue to supply ample funds to ensure stability in financial markets."
