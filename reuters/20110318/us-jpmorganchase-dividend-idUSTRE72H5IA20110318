 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co raised its quarterly dividend to 25 cents per share from 5 cents per share and authorized a $15 billion share repurchase. 

 The Fed on Friday said it would allow some of the largest U.S. banks to boost or restart dividend payments as it notified them whether they had passed a second round of stress tests. JPMorgan Chase will pay the new higher dividend at the end of April, the company said on Friday. The Federal Reserve told the bank it could repurchase up to $8 billion in shares during 2011 as part of the new $15 billion share buyback program. (Reporting by  Maria Aspan ; editing by John Wallace)
