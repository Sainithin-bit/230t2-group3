 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. ( 7011.T ) and U.S. conglomerate General Electric Co. ( GE.N ) are set for a tie-up on nuclear and wind power generation, the Nihon Keizai Shimbun (Nikkei) reported on Saturday. 

 The move is aimed at strengthening Mitsubishi Heavy's overseas business, it added. As part of their plans, the two companies are expected to jointly place a bid as early as next month on a roughly $300 million project to expand capacity by around 20 percent at the 1,360 megawatt Laguna Verde nuclear plant in Mexico. General Electric, which made the plant's two boiling-water reactors, will provide reactor equipment, while Mitsubishi Heavy will provide steam turbines. For wind power, Mitsubishi Heavy will supply General Electric with gears that are a fundamental component for wind turbines, with shipments possibly starting in 2008, the paper said. Mitsubishi Heavy officials were not available for comment.
