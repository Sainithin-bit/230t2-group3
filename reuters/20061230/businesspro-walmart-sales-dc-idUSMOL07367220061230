 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ( WMT.N ) estimated 
on Saturday that December sales rose 1.6 percent at its U.S. 
stores open at least a year, beating its forecast, in the 
heaviest shopping period of the year. 

  The world's biggest retailer had expected same-store sales 
to be flat to up 1 percent. Wal-Mart and most other major U.S. 
retailers will release final December sales data on Thursday.  Wall Street is watching holiday sales particularly closely 
this year for clues on how consumer spending is holding up in 
the face of a slowing housing market.  Analysts have been bracing for disappointing holiday season 
sales, particular among clothing chains, after unusually mild 
December weather in many parts of the country crimped demand 
for winter apparel.  For November, Wal-Mart posted its first same-store sales 
decline in more than a decade, despite aggressive discounts on 
products ranging from food to flat-panel televisions.  The poor November showing cast doubt on Wal-Mart's 
fourth-quarter earnings prospects. The retailer is expected to 
update its profit forecast on Thursday.  Wal-Mart's closest competitor, Target Corp. ( TGT.N ), said 
on December 18 that its December same-store sales were on track 
to meet its forecast for 3.5 percent to 5.5 percent growth.
