 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Canon Inc. ( 7751.T ) and Toshiba Corp. 
( 6502.T ) are considering delaying or scrapping their plan to 
build a $1.7 billion display panel plant in Japan due to a 
patent dispute with Nano-Proprietary Inc. NNPP.OB, a source 
close to the matter said on Saturday. 

  Canon and Toshiba formed a joint venture, SED Inc., in 2004 
to develop and make surface-conduction electron-emitter display 
(SED) panels, which are thinner and consume less energy than 
liquid crystal display (LCD) and plasma panels.  But Texas-based Nano-Proprietary brought a lawsuit against 
Canon in 2005, claiming that the use of its patented flat-panel 
technology at SED Inc. is not covered under a license agreement 
with the Japanese maker of cameras and office equipment.  Canon, which has high hopes for SED TVs as a generator of 
growth, and Toshiba could announce their decision on the plant 
in January, the source said. Construction of the plant was 
slated to start early next year.  Canon and Toshiba said in March they would delay the launch 
of SED TVs by more than a year to the last quarter of 2007 to 
improve cost competitiveness in a market known for steep price 
erosion, which has cast a shadow over the product's commercial 
feasibility.
