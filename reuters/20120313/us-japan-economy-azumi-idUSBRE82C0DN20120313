 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japanese Finance Minister Jun Azumi said on Tuesday he welcomed the Bank of Japan's decision earlier to hold off on additional monetary policy easing and to expand a scheme intended to boost loans to industries with growth potential. 
 The BOJ surprised markets last month by easing monetary policy and setting a 1 percent inflation goal, signaling a more aggressive monetary policy stance to beat deflation, partly in response to political pressure on the central bank to act. (Reporting by Stanley White)
