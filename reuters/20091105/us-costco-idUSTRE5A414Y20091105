 (Reuters) - Costco Wholesale Corp reported a 5 percent increase in October same-store sales, helped by a weak U.S. dollar that helped push up international sales. 

 Analysts on average were expecting a rise of 4.7 percent in same-store sales, including the impact of fuel prices and foreign exchange, according to Thomson Reuters data. Same-store sales at U.S. locations rose 2 percent, while international division sales surged 17 percent, the company said. October net sales rose 7 percent to $5.68 billion. Excluding the impact of gasoline prices and foreign exchange, the company said U.S. comparable sales rose 3 percent, while on a local currency basis international same-store sales rose 7 percent.
