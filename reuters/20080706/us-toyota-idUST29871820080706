 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp ( 7203.T ) plans to install solar panels on its next-generation Prius hybrid cars, becoming the first major automaker to use solar power for a vehicle, the Nikkei business daily reported on Monday. 

 The paper said Toyota would equip solar panels on the roof of the high-end version of the Prius when it redesigns the gasoline-electric hybrid car early next year, and the power generated by the system would be used for the air conditioning. Toyota plans to use solar panels made by Kyocera Corp ( 6971.T ), the Nikkei said. A Toyota spokeswoman could not immediately confirm the report. The Prius, the world's first mass-produced gasoline-electric hybrid car, first went on sale in Japan in late 1997 and in other markets in 2000, and its cumulative sales have topped 1 million units worldwide. Toyota remodeled the Prius with an improved hybrid system in 2003 and is expected to launch a third-generation version by next year. (Reporting by Sachi Izumi; Editing by  Chris Gallagher )
