 MIAMI  (Reuters) - Clients of Banco Santander SA ( SAN.MC ) have asked a U.S. judge to scuttle its plan to compensate customers for losses linked to accused swindler Bernard Madoff, saying it falls far short of a bigger potential payout. 

 An emergency motion for an injunction to block the proposed settlement was filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida on Friday. According to court documents, it was filed on behalf of the same investors who filed a class-action lawsuit against Santander on Monday of last week because of losses they suffered through the Spanish bank's Madoff-hit Optimal Strategic U.S. Equity Fund. The plaintiffs in the lawsuit are Chilean company Mar Octava Limitada and Marcelo Guillermo Testa, a Buenos Aires resident. Santander said last week it would compensate all individual clients who invested in Optimal through the issuance of 1.38 billion euros ($1.77 billion) in preferential shares with an annual coupon of 2 percent. In the injunction motion, a copy of which was obtained by Reuters, investors demand that the share issue be halted immediately because the proposed settlement is "coercive" and threatens to undermine the class-action lawsuit. It would also cost the Eurozone's biggest bank less than the 2.33 billion euros ($2.99 billion) it has acknowledged its clients may have lost to Madoff via its alternative investment fund manager Optimal, lawyers for the plaintiffs said. The lawyers contend that Santander had failed to disclose the lawsuit in Florida, even though it was filed before the bank's proposed settlement was made public. "Santander International has launched a misleading and coercive campaign to pick off putative class members, one-by-one, by pressuring them to release their claims based on incomplete and misleading information," the injunction request says. "Nor does Santander disclose that the settlement offer is for less than the amount sought in the class-action," it adds. "Even the face amount of Santander's offer is illusory, as it is to be paid not in cash but in coupons that are not assured to be liquid or tradeable ... These coupons are virtually certain to have a value which is far less than the face value." Legal experts who have viewed the documents in the Santander case have said the U.S. judge was likely to schedule a hearing on the injunction motion within a week or 10 days. Santander declined to comment on the call for an injunction on Monday, but the bank has not accepted any liability in its proposed settlement, saying it acted at all times with due diligence in its management of clients investments in Optimal.
