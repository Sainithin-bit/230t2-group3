 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Dallas Federal Reserve President Richard Fisher warned on Monday against "Buy America" provisions in a proposed congressional fiscal stimulus law and said it could lead to devastating protectionism. 

 "Protectionism is the crack cocaine of economics ... (it) leads to economic death," Fisher told C-Span television in an interview for its Washington Journal program. "We just cannot afford to go down that path," said Fisher, who is not a voting member of the Fed's policy-setting committee this year. (Reporting by  Alister Bull ; Editing by )
