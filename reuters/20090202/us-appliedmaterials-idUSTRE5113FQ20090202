 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Applied Materials Inc ( AMAT.O ) warned it would post a quarterly loss due to charges for restructuring, inventory and financial problems at its clients, as demand fell for semiconductor and display products. 

 The No. 1 supplier of semiconductor manufacturing equipment on Monday also forecast net sales for its first fiscal quarter that ended January 25, of $1.33 billion, at the low end of its previous target range and below the average Wall Street forecast of $1.41 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. Piper Jaffray analyst Jesse Pichel said the charges were "par for the course in the worst downturn in the history of the semiconductor industry," but he worried about how much worse the market would get before it improves. "The bigger question is how low can sales go in this downturn where there doesn't seem to be any glimpse of a recovery," Pichel said. "The stock has been buttressed by their early success in the solar market. How will its solar business fare given that the solar industry is highly dependent on credit and is suffering a downturn as well." Shares of Applied Materials, which has pushed aggressively into the solar equipment business to seek new growth, were flat at $9.37 amid a chip rally that saw the Philadelphia semiconductor index .SOXX rise 1.23 percent. Analysts said that while there were no clear signs for optimism, some investors who have already punished chip shares see the bad news as a sign that things may be near bottom. Applied Materials' share price has halved in the last year, while the chip index is down almost 55 percent. Like others in the industry, Applied Materials has been suffering from a glut of chip manufacturing capacity, while the economic recession has hurt demand for chips used in everything from personal computers to cell phones. Other manufacturing gear makers that have announced weak results include KLA Tencor ( KLAC.O ) and LAM Research ( LRCX.O ). DETERIORATING CUSTOMERS Applied Materials had warned in November that profit would fall far short of analyst expectations and announced 1,800 job cuts, or 12 percent of its workforce, in a restructuring plan to be completed by the end of the current 2009 year. It said on Monday that it would take a charge of 6 cents per share for the restructuring, as well as a 2 cent-per-share provision for doubtful accounts receivable related to some customers' deteriorating financial condition, and a 1 cent per share additional inventory charge due to a decline in semiconductor demand. As a result, it expects to post a net loss per share of 9 cents to 11 cents for the quarter, compared with its previous target of break-even to a profit of 4 cents a share. Analysts were expecting a profit of 2 cents per share excluding the charges, according to Reuters Estimates. While the company did not name its problem customers, financials analysts noted that memory chip maker Qimonda AG QMNDQ.PK had started insolvency proceedings last month, and that the entire memory chip industry was having difficulties due to weakening computer demand. "The worst of this is coming from the memory companies particularly DRAM," said Pacific Crest Securities analyst Twigg Weston, referring to dynamic random access memory used in computers. "There's a huge amount of overcapacity." Applied Materials said it intends to continue to implement cost-reduction programs, including shutdowns and additional restructuring activities, to meet what it called unprecedented business conditions. Its preliminary results statement gave no more details. The company is set to post final results on February 10. Global semiconductor sales fell 22 percent in December to $22.3 billion. with the steepest revenue declines seen in the memory chip sector, according to the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) on Monday. It also cited falling demand for automotive products, personal computers, cell phones and corporate information technology products.
