 BORDEAUX, France  (Reuters) - A Ford Motor Co ( F.N ) factory in Blanquefort, western France, will be acquired by HZ Holding France SAS, the French subsidiary of a Germany company, Ford said on Monday, saving 1,600 jobs at the plant. 

 The site, which makes gearbox components had been due to close next year. The government will also put 12 million euros ($15.3 million) into the plant over three years, on condition that no jobs are cut. "Ford intends to sell its automatic transmission plant to French company HZ Holding," John Fleming, chief executive of Ford Europe, told a news conference. "Consultations with the works council will now begin. Depending on how these consultations progress, the sale can be completed by the end of April. The offer provides for no changes to levels of staff." French Economy Minister Christine Lagarde welcomed the planned move, saying in a statement it meant her aim of safeguarding jobs and industrial activity had been met. Ford will continue to source automatic transmissions through the plant until 2011. "This can provide a helpful buffer until the new projects are in place," said Markus Ziegler, chief executive of HZ Holding France. "We know that the economy world wide is in a very difficult situation," said Fleming. "The majority of the transmissions made here go to the North American market. It's extremely difficult to predict even next week, next month or next year, the condition of the market." ($1=.7827 euros) (Additional reporting by  James Mackenzie ; Editing by Greg Mahlich)
