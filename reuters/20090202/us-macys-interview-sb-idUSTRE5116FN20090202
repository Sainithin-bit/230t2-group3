 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Department store operator Macy's Inc sees its sales and earnings rebounding in the middle of 2010, its chief executive Terry Lundgren said in an interview on Monday. 

 His comments came after the company said it would slash 7,000 jobs, cut its quarterly dividend and forecast fiscal 2009 earnings far below Wall Street's expectations. "The initiatives we are putting in place will be in place in the second quarter of this year. As we execute against our strategies, my guess is that in the middle of 2010 we should see improved performance, at least versus our competitors," CEO Terry Lundgren said, referring to its sales and earnings. Macy's, which is planning its inventory and expenses conservatively, is doing so, Lundgren said, because he believes the economic stimulus package being considered by U.S. Senate may take time to show results. "I believe its going to take time for consumers to believe that they are secure in their jobs, secure in their homes... and that they can return to a spending pattern that perhaps is not what it was two years ago but more than in the past year." U.S. retailers are still recovering from a choppy holiday sales season, which turned out to be the worst in nearly four decades, as consumers curtailed spending or sought deep discounts for items they wanted to buy. The desire for value persisted in January, Lundgren said. "Its been very promotional for sure," Lundgren said. "They are buying some full-priced products but they are certainly continuing to looking for value." The home furnishings segment, which has suffered in recent months, will continue to be challenged in 2009, Lundgren said, but added that Macy's did not have plans to exit the segment. "A great deal of traffic is generated through home furnishings," Lundgren said. "Furnishings generates traffic through promotions in store, and those customers often buy apparel, accessories and cosmetics." The company announced a cash tender offer for $950 million in senior notes maturing in 2009, but Moody's Investors Service said it may cut Macy's ratings into junk territory, citing its high debt load and doubt that it could maintain credit metrics to stay an investment grade company. Macy's shares were down 7 cents in after-hours trading from their close of $8.59 on the New York Stock Exchange. (Reporting by Aarthi Sivaraman; editing by Gunna Dickson)
