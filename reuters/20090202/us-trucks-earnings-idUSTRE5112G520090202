 STOCKHOLM  (Reuters) - Europe's heavy truck makers are expected to post sharply lower profits after a collapse in demand in the fourth quarter, and they should brace for even worse conditions in the coming year, analysts believe. 

 With emptying order books, an ailing construction equipment unit and overcapacity looming, Sweden's Volvo ( VOLVb.ST ) is likely to be hit the hardest among Europe's top players, according to Reuters polls. Volvo's pretax profit is seen down 96 percent at 231 million Swedish crowns ($28 million) in the quarter, including restructuring costs that analysts expect will come in at 269 million crowns. Truck sales are seen down 15 percent and the company is also expected to cut its dividend in half. The firm, the world number-two by truck sales, reported close to zero order intake in the third quarter and shut production for much of December. "The fourth quarter will be affected by an under-absorption of fixed costs, and the big question is whether Volvo Trucks really can manage to make profit under these conditions," said Hampus Engellau, analyst at Handelsbanken. Germany's MAN ( MANG.DE ) and Swedish rival Scania ( SCVb.ST ) are expected to fare less badly as they have more flexible labor forces and can adapt more easily. Analysts expect Germany's MAN to report a 27 percent drop in year-on-year pretax profit, while Scania's profit is seen down 35 percent. Median estimates indicate there will be no cuts in MAN's dividend, while Scania's dividend is seen falling 20 percent. The truck industry, a bellwether for the wider economy as it reflects changes in international trade, was one of the first to feel the sting when the financial crisis hit last year. Orders plummeted as customers, heavily dependent on ready credit to finance their truck investments, were stranded with no means of financing purchases and had to cancel orders. Demand fell further when Europe's industrial activity slowed dramatically. Registrations of new heavy trucks fell by more than 18 percent to 73,406 vehicles in Europe in the fourth quarter, according to industry data from ACEA. "One has the impression that there has been a total halt in many industries from the end of November through December, and the truck industry has been among those most severely hurt," said Michael Andersson, analyst at Evli. RECORD DROP? Truck makers have been reluctant to forecast what 2009 might bring in terms of demand, although MAN Chief Executive Hakan Samuelsson said in early December he expected the company's truck output to fall 30 percent. Analysts say that a drop of 40 percent in just one year -- which would be a record for that timeframe -- could be a reasonable scenario given all the economic uncertainty. "The risk is definitely on the downside ... and it is possible we could face the biggest drop ever in a single year," said one analyst. "The outlook for 2009 is uncertain -- we will not receive a lot of information concerning the market because there basically is no visibility," said Engellau of Handelsbanken. Scania's fourth-quarter earnings report is due on Tuesday, February 3. Volvo's report is scheduled for Friday, February 6 and MAN will report on February 19. (editing by John Stonestreet)
