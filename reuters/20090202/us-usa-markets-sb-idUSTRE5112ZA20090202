 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. consumers cut spending for a sixth straight month in December and their incomes shrank, according to a government report on Monday that underscored the rapid deterioration in the economy. 

 KEY POINTS: * The Commerce Department said spending decreased by 1.0 percent after falling by a revised 0.8 percent in November. * That figure was previously reported as a 0.6 percent drop. * Incomes fell by 0.2 percent after November's 0.4 percent decline, previously reported as a 0.2 percent decline. * Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast spending falling by 0.9 percent and incomes slipping 0.4 percent. * For the whole of 2008, spending rose 3.6 percent, the smallest increase since 1961. * Incomes increased 3.7 percent, the smallest advance since 2003. COMMENTS: SCOTT BROWN, CHIEF ECONOMIST, RAYMOND JAMES & ASSOCIATES, ST PETERSBURG, FLORIDA: "The numbers are pretty close to expectations. I would note the increase in the savings rate. This gets into the idea that if people start saving more they will be spending less, so the downturn will be more severe and long lasting." MARKET REACTION: STOCKS: U.S. equity index futures add to losses after personal income, spending data. BONDS: U.S. Treasury debt prices extend gains. DOLLAR: U.S. dollar trims losses versus the euro.
