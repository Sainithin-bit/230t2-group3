 Here is a list of some of the key deals signed by NBC: July 1994 - The UK's Independent Television News (ITN) signs a multi-million dollar deal to supply news coverage to NBC.

August 1995 - Acquires Outlet Communications Inc., which owns three television stations in top-50 markets, for about $397 million.

The deal is said to be worth $350 million.
