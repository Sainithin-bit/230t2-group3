 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - New orders received by U.S. factories posted their first drop in five months in August, government data showed on Friday, going against Wall Street expectations that they would rise. 

 Orders fell 0.8 percent after rising 1.4 percent in July, which was originally reported as a 1.3 percent increase, according to the Commerce Department. Analysts polled by Reuters were expecting them to gain by 0.3 percent. The drop was the first since March, when they fell 1.9 percent. Factory orders were also down when compared to August 2008, by 22.5 percent. Unfilled orders dropped 0.4 percent in August. They have now fallen for 11 months in a row, which is the longest streak of consecutive monthly decreases on records dating to 1992, the Commerce Department said. Inventories fell 0.8 percent. They have decreased for 12 months in a row, the longest streak since 2002. Durable goods orders had their steepest drop, of 2.6 percent, since January, when they fell 7.8 percent. Orders of durable goods -- big ticket items meant to last -- were originally reported as declining 2.4 percent in August. (Reporting by  Lisa Lambert , Editing by Andrea Ricci)
