 BOSTON  (Reuters) - Shares of U.S. staffing firms fell on Friday, after government data showed a sharper-than-expected drop in employment in September, raising concerns about a potentially anemic economic recovery. 

 Temporary staffing firm executives said they still expect U.S. unemployment to edge higher than the 9.8 percent it reached last month, but said demand for temps could begin to rebound by early next year as the economy pulls out of its worst downturn since the Great Depression. "We're still shedding jobs, which is bad, but things are less bad than they were three to six months ago," said Scot Melland, chief executive of Dice Holdings Inc, which runs specialized websites focused on technology and financial services. U.S. employers cut 263,000 jobs in September, more than analysts had expected, pushing the unemployment rate to its highest level since June 1983, according to Labor Department data. But analysts and executives said the sharper-than-expected drop does not necessarily signal a break in the trend of mild economic recovery.

So far this year, the sector is up 25 percent, outpacing the 14 percent rebound of the S&P 500 index. "As staffing stocks have rebounded significantly in recent months, we prefer to wait for a pullback before becoming more constructive on these names," wrote BMO Capital Markets analyst Jeffrey Silber, in a note to clients. LIGHT FOR TECH, FINANCE WORKERS? While demand for workers in the construction, manufacturing and retail trades continued to drop steadily, staffing executives said employers were looking for more temps with finance and technology skills. "They're restarting projects that were on hold," said Tig Gilliam, CEO of the North American operations of Adecco SA. U.S. CEOs, having slashed millions of workers from their companies over the past year, remain jittery about employment prospects. A Business Roundtable survey released on Tuesday showed that 40 percent expected more layoffs over the next six months, compared with 13 percent who looked to add jobs. Having lived through a brutal downturn, corporate America will be reluctant to start adding permanent staffers even when the economy shows signs of recovery, Gilliam said. "This is an absolute consistent theme among our clients," Gilliam said. "Every single one of them I've talked to has said, 'Look, I've had to cut people I never thought I had to cut because of the depth of this recession. I don't want to ever do it again. I want to come into this with a much more flexible approach.'" Among U.S. staffing stocks, Dice was down 2.4 percent at $6.13 in midday trading; Monster Worldwide Inc was down 3.1 percent at $16.04 and Manpower Inc slipped 1.9 percent to $52.00.
