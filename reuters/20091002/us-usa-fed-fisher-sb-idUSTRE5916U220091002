 DURHAM, North Carolina  (Reuters) - The U.S. economy has been weakened so severely by the deep recession that the job market is unlikely to recover for a while despite an anticipated return to growth over the last half of the year, Dallas Federal Reserve President Richard Fisher on Friday. 

 "I call it ... post-traumatic slack syndrome," he said at Duke University's Sanford School of Public Policy. "We have so much slack in the economic system, we are seeing deflating or disinflating prices." As businesses seek to cut costs, they will keep payrolls trim, said Fisher, who will not be a voter on the Fed's policy-setting panel until 2011. "I would say it's going to be some time before we get back to decent employment numbers," he said. Growth is currently being generated by government spending and tax cut programs, not private sector investment, Fisher said.
