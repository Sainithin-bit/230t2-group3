 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - CIT Group Inc's ( CIT.N ) proposed debt exchange would give bondholders about 92.5 percent of the company, the company said Friday morning. 

 Current preferred shareholders would end up with 5 percent of the company's equity and voting rights, while current stockholders would get 2.5 percent. The plan offers bondholders new debt in the company as well. Investors holding notes maturing in 2009 would get more new debt than those holding debt maturing between 2013 and 2018. The company is also looking for votes for a prepackaged bankruptcy, should the exchange offer prove unsuccessful. Under the terms outlined on Friday, most debtholders would get 70 cents of new debt on the dollar, plus new common stock. (Reporting by  Dan Wilchins , editing by Gerald E. McCormick)
