 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A holder of CIT Group Inc's ( CIT.N ) subordinated bonds is seeking better terms from the company in order to participate in its debt exchange plan, claiming that the offer burdens the junior noteholders with disproportionate losses. 

 Little Bear Investments said on Friday that CIT's plan to exchange its subordinated debt for preferred shares, but not new secured debt, is unfair. CIT on Thursday launched the debt exchange offer in the hope that it would help prevent the struggling lender to small and mid-sized companies from filing for bankruptcy. "Over one hundred classes of debt are being asked to take a write down of 10 to 30 percent of the face value of their debt," Zachary Prensky, managing director of Little Bear, said in a statement. "However, holders of subordinated debt are being asked to voluntarily surrender 100 percent of their valid, existing claim against CIT solely in consideration of a small amount of new preferred whose ultimate recovery or liquidating value is unknown," he said. The exchange offers are conditional upon achieving an aggregate debt reduction of at least $5.7 billion, with specific targets for the periods from 2009 to 2012. Some $1.89 billion, or around a third of the debt CIT is seeking to extinguish, is subordinated, Little Bear said. "In our opinion, this is extremely unfair to the subordinated debt holders and needs to be adjusted in order to ensure our full participation in the bond exchange," it said. Little Bear said it plans to hold a conference call with other owners of CIT's subordinated debt on Tuesday to discuss the bond exchange.
