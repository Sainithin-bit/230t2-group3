 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Vice President Joe Biden called unemployment figures released on Friday "tough news" but said the administration was doing the right things to get the economy moving again following the worst recession in decades. 

 Asked whether a second stimulus package was needed to boost economic recovery, Biden told reporters at the White House, "We are still working on finishing the first one and doing it right."
