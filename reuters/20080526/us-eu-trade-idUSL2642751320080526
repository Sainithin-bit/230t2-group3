 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - France and some other European Union states protested on Monday that new proposals for a global trade deal ask too much of the bloc, but Europe's trade chief said he had "overwhelming support" to press on with the talks. 

 The World Trade Organisation's Doha negotiations to lower global barriers to exports are now in their seventh year but face a crucial test in the next few weeks, after which the U.S. presidential election might cause years of further delay. Ahead of an expected meeting of ministers from WTO countries in June or July to push for a breakthrough, mediators last week published proposals they hope can help close the gaps. France, Europe's biggest food producer and long the most vocal critic of Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson, renewed a campaign to counter what it sees as a bad deal in the making. Anne-Marie Idrac, France's junior trade minister, said the new WTO proposals were "less ambitious and balanced than ever". "We think the conditions are less in place than ever for a ministerial meeting to take place in June that would be in Europe's interests," she told reporters after Mandelson briefed EU foreign ministers on the state of the negotiations. France, Ireland and other states with big farm interests have accused Mandelson of offering too many farming concessions in return for a WTO deal that helps EU makers of goods such as cars, textiles or chemicals and service providers. But European manufacturers have also slammed the new WTO proposals, saying they would expose them to competition from developing economies such as Brazil, India or China while those emerging markets remained largely closed. VERY SMALL MINORITY? Mandelson said he got backing at Monday's ministerial meeting to press on to try to secure improvements for the EU. "The view expressed that the conditions do not exist for the round to be concluded successfully was a very small minority view," he told reporters. "Overwhelmingly, the view of the member states was that we must continue to negotiate hard in order to get a balanced outcome in the round." Mandelson said he would be talking to counterparts from other WTO powers this week and he hoped for positive signs. "The priority needs to be industrial goods. This is now becoming the big political question of this round," he said, adding that the negotiations would be heading for failure if big developing countries did not open up their markets more. But he said he did not share the view of Europe's manufacturing lobby that the WTO industrial goods proposals represented a step backwards from opening up global trade, because so many options remained on the table. "Still amongst a few, DDA seems to stand for Don't Do Anything," Mandelson said, referring to the round's official name of the Doha Development Agenda. "I agree with the Swedish foreign minister who said it's the Day of Delivery has Arrived." (Additional reporting by Yves Clarisse; Editing by  David Fogarty )
