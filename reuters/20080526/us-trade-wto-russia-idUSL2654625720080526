 GENEVA  (Reuters) - The World Trade Organisation (WTO) agreed on Monday to pursue Russia's accession talks, but a political row between Moscow and Georgia still threatens a veto over the whole process. 

 Russia is by far the biggest country still outside the 152-member WTO, which umpires the world trading system. Membership would put Russia on an equal footing with other trading powers including the United States, which would then need to lift Cold War-era trade provisions tying economic relations to emigration rights for religious minorities. But former Soviet Georgia has since last month blocked Russia's 15-year-old bid to join the group because of Moscow's ties with two breakaway Georgian regions. Under WTO rules a candidate country must reach agreement with the entire WTO membership, represented by a working party which any existing member can join, as well as agreeing separate bilateral deals with any member that seeks them. Georgia objects to Russia's support for its rebel regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, and the two countries have come close to fighting over the dispute. The United Nations said on Monday that Russia had shot down an unmanned Georgian spy drone over Abkhazia last month. The Russia accession working party met on Monday at the WTO to decide the next steps. Iceland's EU ambassador Stefan Haukur Johannesson, who chairs the accession talks, said it would meet again in the week of June 16 to tackle outstanding issues. But the meeting will officially be informal because of Georgia's stance. Final approval by the working party, whenever that happens, will need to take place at a formal meeting. Johannesson said there was no deadline to complete the accession negotiations. "This is a result-driven process and the end will come when the end will come," he told a news conference. "There's enormous work ahead of us." REMAINING WORK The three remaining areas to be negotiated with Russia govern state trading enterprises, export duties and agriculture. "We work on these sections continuously and I hope we are not very far from the end," said Russian WTO negotiator Maxim Medvedkov. Russia still needs to satisfy members that its state trading enterprises operate on commercial lines and settle differences with the United States over the scope of such organizations. He told the news conference Moscow was ready to comply with WTO rules on state trading enterprises, but still needed to resolve differences over them with the United States. On export duties, the main problem was duties imposed on timber to help Russia's wood-processing industries. These make EU rivals in Sweden and Finland uncompetitive by pushing up the price of raw materials. Other export duties, such as those levied on gas and crude oil, were intended purely to raise revenue, Medvedkov said. In agriculture, Russian domestic support for farmers will need to be brought into line with WTO rules. Besides Georgia, Russia must reach a bilateral agreement with Saudi Arabia, which objects to Russian restrictions on investment in its oil and gas industry. Medvedkov said Russian negotiators would be going to Riyadh next week for talks. He said Russia had not held bilateral talks with Georgia on this visit to the WTO as Georgia refuses to do so until Moscow rescinds rules stepping up ties with the breakaway provinces. "We don't see a connection between WTO rules and WTO accession in particular ... Our position is and will be that the WTO should not be used for political discussions. It's a trade organisation and should be oriented on trade," Medvedkov said. (Editing by  Catherine Evans )
