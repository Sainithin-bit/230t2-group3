 AMSTERDAM  (Reuters) - Drawing lessons from recent financial market turbulence is likely to take several years, European Central Bank Governing Council member Nout Wellink said on Monday. 

 "It is too early to provide a thorough analysis of the causes and characteristics of the recent financial turbulence," Wellink, who also heads the Dutch central bank, told a conference at the University of Groningen. "Apart from the fact that markets are still fragile, it will probably take several years before we are in a position to put these developments fully into perspective," he said, according to the text of his speech distributed by the central bank. Wellink was also quoted as saying on sidelines of the conference that financial markets should look past short-term data to form their views on the interest rate outlook. "(Financial markets) should not react to every change in the environment ... They should look through the information to see the underlying trends," he was quoted as saying by news agency Market News. Wellink said oil price volatility made it difficult to forecast consumer price inflation developments. "What is important is that inflation expectations are anchored at (a) low level," he added.
