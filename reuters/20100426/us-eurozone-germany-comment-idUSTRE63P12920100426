 (Reuters) - Greece has asked European partners and the International Monetary Fund for financial aid to help fund its crippling public debt, but polls show a majority of people in Germany oppose helping Athens. 

 Following are extracts from Monday's editorials and articles in influential German newspapers on Greece: BILD (Center-right, mass-circulation) "Crisis? What crisis?" Next to a picture of people sitting outside a bar enjoying themselves, Bild writes: "There was revelry as always in Athens' party district of Monastiraki at the weekend, no hint of crisis." DIE WELT (Center-right) "The emergency loans from the EU and the International Monetary Fund ... will only secure the ailing country's refinancing for the short term and reduce its interest rate burden by the odd interest rate point. "The debt mountain will also not be saved away easily -- especially as excessively strict cuts to wages and state spending greatly increase the risk of a depression in Greece. The problem is even more irresolvable this way. "There remains only the flight into devaluation, and that requires exiting the euro zone. This would make the country competitive again with its goods and services -- a crucial requirement to be able to really repay the loans." SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG (Center-left) "The crisis is still controllable but the situation could easily spin out of control, as soon as doubts arise about the solvency of Portugal, Spain or even Italy. The International Monetary Fund fears, for this scenario, not just a European crisis but a global one. "Now the (IMF's) experts can work there (in Greece) and will probably come to a conclusion within two weeks. In the meantime, there can be more doubts about EU help for Greece being available. Anyone in Berlin who still thinks they can delay the issue until after the state election in North Rhine-Westphalia (on May 9) is playing with fire. Every question mark behind the Greece program pushes up the interest rates and the financing costs. That could make the clean-up operation irresolvable." FINANCIAL TIMES DEUTSCHLAND (Business) "You could almost think that nothing had changed in the debate about Greece: the German finance minister continues to question the billions of euros in aid, politicians from the CSU and the FDP are calling for the exclusion of the country from the European Union, and the chancellor hesitates. "These tactics may help the election campaign in North Rhine-Westphalia. But they are unsettling markets, thereby damaging both the Greeks and the euro zone. "Instead of reacting quickly to the request for aid, coalition politicians are spending their time on theoretical proposals, for example the exclusion of Greece from the currency union: finance speculators would then straight away try to push other stricken EU states out of the euro zone. And if Greece rescheduled its debt ... it is true that Germans would not have to cough up aid. But it would get German financial institutions into a scrape, as they would have to write off part of their credit to Greece. "If the government wants to help the euro, it has to send a quick and clear signal that it will stand by the Greeks. And the EU must quickly find a solution to make sure that Spain and Portugal are not next. "That certainly won't be easy. A change in the EU treaty, that contains the no bailout clause, would take too long. A European Monetary Fund or issuing of euro bonds cover up considerable risks. But you can only solve these problems if you dare to tackle them, not with menacing gestures and delaying tactics." (Compiled by Paul Carrel and Sarah Marsh)
