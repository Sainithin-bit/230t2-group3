 PHILADELPHIA  (Reuters) - Bank of America Corp ( BAC.N ) has narrowed the contenders for chairman to directors Frank Bramble and Charles Holliday, according to The Wall Street Journal. 

 Although another candidate could still emerge, a decision is expected Wednesday following Bank of America's shareholder meeting, the newspaper said in its online edition. Bank of America could not be immediately reached for comment. Bramble, 61, is a former vice chairman of MBNA Corp, a credit-card issuer bought by Bank of America in 2006, while Holliday, 62, served as head of DuPont Co, the newspaper said. The Journal said Holliday is considered the favorite to become Bank of America chairman. Neither Bramble nor Holliday are expected to change the strategy of the bank's Chief Executive Brian Moynihan, the newspaper said. U.S. officials have been informed about the impending selection of a new chairman but haven't asked for control over the process, the newspaper said.
