 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - New orders at U.S. factories rose a greater-than-expected 3.1 percent in March on a rise in civilian aircraft orders, but were also greater for the first time since December when transportation orders were excluded, a Commerce Department report showed on Wednesday. 

 Analysts polled by Reuters were expecting factory orders to rise 2.1 percent. February orders were revised to show a 1.4 percent gain. Aside from transportation orders, factory orders rose 1.9 percent after being unchanged in February. February orders excluding transportation were first reported as a 0.4 percent decline. Orders for durable goods, items meant to least three years or longer, also rose a bigger-than-expected 3.7 percent in March. Analysts were expecting durables orders to gain 3.3 percent. In a sign sluggishness in business investment may have been short-lived, nondefense capital goods orders excluding aircraft, considered a proxy for business spending, rose 4.8 percent, the first gain in three months and the largest rise since September 2004. Transportation orders jumped 9.5 percent on a 38.1 percent increase in civilian aircraft and parts. Orders for metals, machinery, electronic products and electrical equipment all rose. Stripping out defense goods, orders rose 3.5 percent in March.
