 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Cablevision Systems Corp. ( CVC.N ) has agreed to an offer from the Dolan family to take the New York-area cable operator private in a deal valuing it at $10.6 billion, the company said on Wednesday. 

 Cablevision shareholders will receive $36.26 per share, a premium of 34 percent over the Dolans' initial bid of $27 per share, made last year, and a premium of 11 percent over Cablevision's closing stock price on Tuesday. The Dolans already own about 20 percent of Cablevision's common stock and control 70 percent of voting power, and have made at least three offers for the company -- only to be rejected by board directors looking for a higher price. This deal values Cablevision at over $5,000 per subscriber, higher than peers Time Warner Cable Inc. ( TWC.N ) and Comcast Corp. ( CMCSA.O ), whose customers are valued at $4,300 and $4,500, respectively, according to Sanford C. Bernstein. The Dolans believe Cablevision can compete more effectively as a private entity in the face of rising competition from telephone company Verizon Communications Inc. ( VZ.N ) in a saturated market, analysts said. The Dolans will pay for the deal by contributing their $2.1 billion equity stake in the company, and will raise $15.5 billion in debt refinancing. They will convert Cablevision common stock into cash and refinance bank debt at a Cablevision holding unit and Rainbow National Services unit. Around $6.5 billion in debt will remain outstanding after the transactions, according to Fitch Ratings. "This new structure and an entrepreneurial perspective will enable us to keep growing the business," the Dolans said in a statement. Charles Dolan is the chairman of the company and his son, James, is the chief executive. Cablevision shares closed up 9.9 percent to $35.90 on the New York Stock Exchange. 'VERY DECENT PRICE' Cablevision serves 3.1 million homes in the New York metropolitan area and owns major media and entertainment assets Madison Square Garden and the New York Knicks pro basketball team and the Rangers pro ice hockey team. There has been speculation for years that Time Warner Inc. ( TWX.N ) would be interested in adding Cablevision's cable systems to Time Warner Cable's New York assets. "I believe this is a very decent price," said Nancy Havens, president of Havens Advisory, a hedge fund that owns a small position in the cable operator. "The best you can hope for is that Time Warner make a public bid." Both Time Warner CEO Dick Parsons and Time Warner Cable CEO Glenn Britt reiterated on Wednesday they would look at Cablevision if it was put up for sale. Todd Mitchell, an analyst at Kaufman Bros., said the Dolans were keen to do the deal soon as it is unlikely the company's Wall Street valuation would hold up much longer. "Over the last two quarters, Cablevision's momentum has slowed because of the already high penetration of advanced services and increasingly aggressive competition from Verizon," said Mitchell. "Now they can hide that as a private company," said Mitchell. Bernstein analyst Craig Moffett said the deal shows the Dolan family's confidence in generating free cash flow from the company as slowing growth means less capital spending. Cablevision has invested heavily to upgrade systems and launch new products, such as digital phone and high-speed Internet services, about two years ahead of other companies and may have less spending ahead as a result. "The buyout also highlights the Dolans' confidence in the resiliency of their business in the face of rising competition from Verizon," Moffett said in a research report. The company said shareholders involved in a legal dispute over the buyout participated in negotiations with the Dolans. The parties have agreed to dismiss pending litigation, subject to court approval. (Additional reporting by  Kenneth Li  and  Paul Thomasch )
