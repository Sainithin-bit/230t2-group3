 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Ever since Clarence Barron persuaded his wife to invest $2,500 as a down payment on Dow Jones & Co. Inc. more than a century ago, the media company has been firmly controlled by one family. 

 His descendants, the Bancroft family, appeared to decide on Tuesday that it will take more than $5 billion to give up that control. Whatever price is offered for Dow Jones may be too little for the Bancrofts, who hold 64.2 percent of the voting stock and thus have final say over any takeover. Their stance has always been to resist approaches, viewing the media company, and particularly its flagship Wall Street Journal, as much a public trust as a publicly traded corporation. Early indications are that they will maintain that stance when it comes to the Murdoch overture. Dow Jones said the Bancrofts planned to vote shares constituting slightly more than 50 percent of the outstanding voting power against the bid. "In view of decades of their adamant resistance to anybody else owning Dow Jones and particularly the Wall Street Journal, I suspect that nothing will come of this," said John Morton, a longtime newspaper analyst. The Bancrofts have been alternately viewed as a blessing and a curse for Dow Jones. While they have been blamed for some strategic missteps, they have also being lauded for protecting the independence of the Wall Street Journal. "The Bancroft's biggest sin, if you want to call it that, has been supporting mediocre to bad management," said a reporter at the Wall Street Journal. But he added the family must "be commended for almost over a century preserving the institution of the Journal." The Bancroft family could not be reached for comment. The overture by Murdoch, which he called friendly and Dow Jones called unsolicited, comes at a time when newspapers are struggling with competition from the Internet for both readers and advertisers. That has put pressure on publishers like Tribune Co. to appease shareholders to consider sales. But Dow Jones is different because of its dual-class stock structure, which was put in place two decades after the company went public in 1963. In the mid 1980s, Dow Jones followed the lead of other family-controlled media companies like the New York Times Co. and issued Class B stock that gave those certain shareholder 10 times the voting power of others. Still, cracks in the family's control have appeared in the past. In 1997, Fortune magazine reported that two family members were discontent with the company's stock performance. The Bancrofts responded with a public statement saying they were unanimously committed to the company's independence. Then, in 2003, the New Yorker magazine reported that New York Times publisher Arthur Sulzberger Jr. met with Roy Hammer, a trustee to the Bancrofts, and proposed a merger with Dow Jones. The idea was rejected without being taken to the board, upsetting some independent directors. By 2005, the New York Post, a paper owned by Murdoch, reported that younger members of the Bancroft family were pushing for a sale. That report prompted rumors that either the Washington Post or Warren Buffett might make a bid. Soon after, Dow Jones broke with tradition by naming Richard Zannino to succeed Peter Kann as chief executive, making him the first non-journalist in charge at the company. Murdoch, 76, said in an interview with Fox News Channel's Neil Cavuto on Tuesday that he could yet win control of the media company. "There's plenty of time and we just take it calmly and hope they will take it calmly," he said. Some Dow Jones shareholders said it would be hard to turn down News Corp.'s highly priced offer, equivalent to a 65 percent premium to Dow Jones' Monday closing share price. "We're talking about a fairly significant premium to where the stock's been trading in recent years and I think they'll have to consider it seriously," said David Wallack, a fund manager at T. Rowe Price Group Inc., the largest institutional holder of Dow Jones stock. Jean-Marie Eveillard, whose First Eagle Global fund owns Dow Jones shares, said, "It will be hard for the Bancroft family to say no even though legally they have the option of doing so .... I think investors who own the shares will be almost unanimous in saying this is a price they cannot refuse."
