 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Walgreen Co. ( WAG.N ), one of the largest U.S. drugstore chains, on Wednesday posted a 9.2 percent rise in April sales at stores open at least a year, driven by strong sales of prescription medications. 

 Walgreen said that Easter being eight days earlier than last year did not affect its April sales results. Total sales rose 14.1 percent to $4.5 billion and pharmacy sales accounted for 65.1 percent of total sales. Same-store pharmacy sales increased 11.2 percent, while the number of prescriptions filled at comparable stores rose 7.3 percent. Walgreen said same-store pharmacy sales got a 2.1 percentage point lift from a shift in the calendar. Customers fill more prescriptions on weekdays versus weekends, and this year's April had one more Monday and one less Saturday than last year. Same-store sales of general, or "front-end" merchandise such as candy and cosmetics rose 5.6 percent. Walgreen, which is based in Deerfield, Illinois, opened 26 stores in April, including seven relocated stores. The company operated 5,693 drugstores as of April 30, up from 5,222 a year ago.
