 LONDON  (Reuters) - Rupert Murdoch's $5 billion bid for Dow Jones & Co DJ.N has highlighted the value of content owned by traditional media companies, but there are few similar trophy assets available among European companies. 

 Successfully securing Dow Jones would help Murdoch deliver a stream of real-time news from Dow Jones Newswires to the new Fox Business Channel, strengthen his Internet presence and provide analysis from the Wall Street Journal and Barron's. Yet the Bancroft family, which holds 64.2 percent of DJ's voting power, has resisted the $60 per share bid, raising the question of whether he could look elsewhere to expand his financial output. Such a calculation may have contributed to sharp rises in shares of Pearson Plc ( PSON.L ) and Reuters Group Plc RTR.L after the bid was revealed on Tuesday. Numis Securities analysts said the steep price Murdoch's News Corp NWSa.N was offering for Dow Jones highlighted the potential value of Pearson's Financial Times brand and could herald an unprecedented bout of competition in business newspapers. The bid was priced at some 16 times Dow Jones's forecast 2007 earnings. "We view News Corp.'s approach as driven by its desire to own a global business brand, with a premium brand and well-developed online footprint," Numis said in a note. But for Murdoch there are few alternative targets which would be as attractive as Dow Jones, with its combination of newswires, financial publications and growing online activities. "We see this as a very specific bid for very specific assets," said ABN AMRO media analyst Paul Gooden in London. Reuters' status as a potential bid target is not clear cut, given no shareholder can own 15 percent or more of the shares and a single golden share can be used to block a hostile bid. HIVE OF ACTIVITY Pearson's Financial Times has been long seen by analysts as a candidate for disposal given the company is primarily an educational publisher. But Chief Executive Marjorie Scardino has repeatedly stated her desire to keep the Financial Times, a view she highlighted when the annual results showed FT Publishing enjoying the strongest underlying sales growth and operating profit performance across the company's nine divisions. Irrespective of Murdoch's ability to win over the Bancroft family, the business news market, particularly in Europe, has been a hive of activity in recent months, as participants seek acquisitions, partnerships and new revenue opportunities. Last month, Dow Jones bought privately-owned financial publisher eFinancialNews for 26.1 million pounds ($52.3 million). Although a relatively small deal, it reflects Dow's push further into online subscription-based financial services. In the market for the distribution of corporate announcements, Pearson's Les Echos newspaper late last year announced a deal with United Business Media's ( UBM.L ) PR Newswire, while pan-European bourse operator Euronext ENXT.PA bought corporate news release service Hugin ASA. In data and financial news, Thomson Corp.'s TOC.TO Thomson Financial is close to launching its rebranded AFX news offering, targeting clients particularly in European emerging markets, with sector commentary and analysis across multiple asset classes. Credit Suisse analysts said Murdoch's move was likely to stimulate interest in the European media sector as a whole, which has underperformed the market by 5 percent over the past month. The broker singled out companies backed by strong brands -- including Pearson, Reuters and German publisher Axel Springer ( SPRGn.DE ), as well as content players such as Dutch television production company Endemol EML.AS. Other names in the frame included magazine and radio station owner Emap EMA.L and publishing and exhibitions group United Business Media ( UBM.L ), particularly given the high level of private equity interest in business-to-business companies.
