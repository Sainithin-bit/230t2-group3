 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Truck and engine maker Navistar International Corp. NAVZ.PK said on Wednesday it had filed an amended counter-complaint in its legal fight with Ford Motor Co. ( F.N ) that seeks damages of more than $2 billion from the troubled Detroit automaker. 

 Navistar, the exclusive supplier of diesel engines to Ford's Super Duty pickups since 1979, said the amended complaint was prompted by indications that Ford was planning to develop diesel engines of its own for introduction prior to 2012. The counter-claim is the latest twist in contract dispute that begin in January, when Ford sued Navistar over warranty costs and engine prices related to the contract for the F-Series, the most popular vehicles in their class. That prompted Navistar to briefly cut off diesel engine shipments to Ford -- though a judge later ordered the company to resume those shipments while the case proceeds.
