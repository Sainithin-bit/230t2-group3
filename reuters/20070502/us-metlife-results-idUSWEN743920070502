 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - MetLife Inc. ( MET.N ), the largest U.S. life insurer by assets, said on Tuesday earnings rose 38 percent in the first quarter, exceeding analysts' estimates, as premiums, fees and revenues from overseas all grew. 

 "They really hit the cover off the ball in international operations," said Rob Haines, an analyst with CreditSights. "Domestic results were also strong, but not eyepopping." International earnings were up 63 percent to a record $124 million from $76 million for the same period a year ago. The company credited growing business in Latin America and Asia for the spike. MetLife said net earnings were $983 million or $1.28 a share, up from $714 million or 93 cents a share in the year earlier quarter, when final net was affected by losses from investments and derivatives. MetLife said operating earnings, which analysts use to measure performance because it excludes investments, were $1.08 billion or $1.41 a share. Analysts, on average, had expected the insurer to earn $1.29 a share from operations, according to Reuters Estimates. In the year-ago quarter, the New York-based insurer earned $1.03 billion or $1.33 a share. MetLife said total premiums, fees and other revenue rose to $8.4 billion, up 6 percent from the previous year, and it reached a record $537.8 billion in total assets. "Some businesses did better than others, but it all averaged out to a good return," said Matt Nellans, an analyst with Morningstar. MetLife's shares closed at $65.86 on the New York Stock Exchange. In the last 12 months, MetLife shares have risen 26 percent or about twice the gain in the Standard & Poor's insurance index. Shares in MetLife's closest competitor, Prudential Financial Inc. ( PRU.N ), rose 21 percent during the same period. "There were a few question marks along with the bright spots," said Craig Weber, an analyst with Celent LLC. MetLife's individual business operating results, which included life insurance and annuities, were down 22 percent, as sales of universal life policies declined. "It's a tepid market," said Weber. "They will have to invigorate sales." Analysts have hinted that there may be more real estate transactions in pipeline. In 2006 MetLife sold Peter Cooper Village and Stuyvesant Town, two apartment complexes in Manhattan for $5.4 billion. It reported a $3 billion after-tax gain from the sale.
