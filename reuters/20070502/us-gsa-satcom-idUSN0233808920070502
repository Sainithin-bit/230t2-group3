 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The U.S. government chose AT&T ( T.N ) and 23 other companies on Wednesday for a contract worth as much as $750 million to provide federal workers with satellite communications. 

 The General Services Administration (GSA) said a compact satellite station that fits in a car trunk will provide all computer, e-mail and broadband Internet capability normally found in an office. The agency said the stations can also operate from aircraft and ships. The five-year contract, called SatCom-II, is designed to provide communication services for federal employees who work in areas where no cable and phone lines exist, like remote borders, and in emergency situations. GSA, which picked the companies, said more than a third of the awardees were small businesses. SatCom-II replaces the government's existing satellite contract and aims to keep pace with satellite technology.
