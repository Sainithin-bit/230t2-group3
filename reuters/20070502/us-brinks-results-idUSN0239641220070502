 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Brink's Co. ( BCO.N ) said on Wednesday that first quarter earnings fell from a year earlier, when it recorded a large one-time gain, but the results topped Wall Street expectations, and its shares rose. 

 "It was a very solid quarter, led by (slightly) better-than-expected results in home security and very strong performance in the armored car business in Latin America," said analyst Chris Marangi of Gabelli & Co. The company's performance in Europe was less encouraging, Marangi said, but expressed confidence in the company's "aggressive" approach to the problems there. "The operating environment in Europe continues to be our greatest challenge," said Chief Executive Michael Dan of the company's armored car unit during the conference call. A company executive said during the call that one of that unit's European divisions will lose a "significant" amount of business and that a response might include cost-reduction efforts. The Richmond, Virginia-based company, which operates armored cars and provides home security systems, said net income fell to $28.7 million, or 61 cents a share, from $403.4 million, or $6.92 a share, a year earlier. The year-earlier results included income from discontinued operations of $379.2 million from the sale of Brink's BAX Global unit. Operating earnings were 61 cents a share. Analysts on average had expected 56 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue rose 13.2 percent to $751.5 million, beating analysts' estimates of $726.3 million. Brink's shares were up $1.26 at $65.29 in afternoon trade on the New York Stock Exchange.
