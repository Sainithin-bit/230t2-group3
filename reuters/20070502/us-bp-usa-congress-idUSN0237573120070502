 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - BP Plc ( BP.L ) executives have been called to testify before a U.S. Congressional committee about corrosion and oil spills at its Alaska operations after again failing to turn over relevant documents, the committee said Wednesday. 

 Members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee said Monday the missing e-mails and other documents turned over by BP appeared to contradict executives' testimony in September that cost concerns had no bearing on corrosion management decisions at the giant Prudhoe Bay oil field in Alaska. "This material raises concerns that shortsighted cost-cutting may have led to the spills and corrosion problems in Alaska," wrote Rep. John Dingell, chairman of the committee, in a letter sent to BP Wednesday. The latest congressional hearing will thrust BP's troubled U.S. operations back into the spotlight and committee members are likely to attempt to draw connections between the oil spills in Alaska and the fatal explosion at a Texas refinery in 2005 that government investigators blamed in part on BP cost cuts. BP has already admitted failure to turn over relevant documents in the Alaska case, including papers related to a leak detection system ordered by Alaska authorities and plans to clean the insides of the pipelines that leaked. U.S. Department of Transportation investigators have said BP's decision to not regularly clean the inside of the pipelines does not follow best industry practices. The committee had originally set a hearing for Thursday to review BP's progress in replacing the corroded oil transit pipelines at Prudhoe Bay that led to largest ever onshore oil spill in Alaska in March 2006 and the partial shutdown of the 400,000 barrels per day field in August.
