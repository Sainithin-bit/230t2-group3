 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. government employment data has been expanded to better reflect the hours and earnings of workers in all sectors in addition to the monthly bonuses and other cash benefits they receive during the month. 

 The new series, which was initially released by the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics with the March employment statistics, includes the earnings and hours of supervisors in the service sector and it also includes more comprehensive information about bonuses. The expanded data is not included in the monthly employment report but is posted simultaneously on the BLS Web site, at  www.bls.gov/ces/cesaepp.htm. The current monthly employment report includes data on the average hours and earnings of production workers in the goods-producing industries and nonsupervisory workers in the service sector, who account for about 80 percent of all employment measured in the monthly survey. The new data includes all workers and this change is designed to better reflect a shift in the U.S. workforce to the service sector from manufacturing, officials at the BLS said. "In the past we've only collected for production workers but now we are going to report the hours and earnings series reported for all employees," a spokesman for the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics said. "The new all-employee hours and earnings series will provide more comprehensive information than the present series for analyzing economic trends," BLS explained in a note on its Web site. Because the data series is new, it will not be seasonally adjusted until 2010, but BLS officials hope the expanded data will still offer a better representation of the pay and hours of U.S. workers, the bulk of whom are now in the service sector. MORE INFO ON BONUS PAY In March 2008, BLS plans to release more expanded hours and earnings detail in limited industries by states and certain metropolitan areas. In addition to a broader range of worker hours, the new data includes more information about other pay and non-wage benefits workers receive. It will include cash payments made to workers, bonuses and exercised stock options. Information gathered in surveys on this information will be done during a broader time period than wage information captured in the monthly employment report. It will include workers who were paid at any time during the month rather than those working on the 12th of the month, as it is recorded in the regular monthly employment report.
