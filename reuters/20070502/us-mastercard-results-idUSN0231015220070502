 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - MasterCard Inc. ( MA.N ) said on Wednesday that quarterly earnings soared nearly 70 percent, as it processed more credit and debit card transactions globally. 

 The results trounced analysts' average expectations, and the company's shares jumped more than 8 percent in premarket trading. Economists are increasingly concerned about the health of consumer spending, which in March grew at its slowest rate in five months. Sales of homes and U.S. autos are declining, and the overall economy grew at a paltry annualized rate of 1.3 percent in the first quarter. But MasterCard's total dollar volume of transactions increased 16.4 percent, and the number of transactions processed rose 19.4 percent during the first quarter, as the number of MasterCard credit and debit cards grew 11.3 percent. MasterCard, which processes credit-card payments for merchants, said first-quarter earnings rose to $214.9 million, or $1.57 a share, from $126.7 million, or 94 cents a share a year earlier. Analysts had on average expected $1.16 a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue rose 24 percent to $915 million during the quarter. Advertising and market development expenses decreased to $178.5 million from $182.7 million a year earlier. MasterCard's shares rose to $124.20 in premarket trading from Tuesday's close of $114.85. The company went public in May 2006 at $39 a share.
