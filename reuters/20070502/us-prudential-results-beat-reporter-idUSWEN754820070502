 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Prudential Financial Inc., the second largest U.S. life insurer, said on Wednesday that earnings rose in the first quarter, helped by growth in assets under management and retail brokerage. 

 Prudential, with over $2 trillion of life insurance in force worldwide, said net earnings were $1.03 billion or $2.18 a share, up from $675 million or $1.38 a share in the year earlier quarter when they were reduced by lower investment gains and obligations from its joint venture with Wachovia Corp. WB.N. Newark, New Jersey-based Prudential said operating earnings, which analysts use to measure performance because it excludes investments, were $868 million or $1.85 a share. Analysts on average had expected the insurers to earn $1.65 a share on that basis, according to Reuters Estimates. In the year ago first quarter, Prudential earned $669 million or $1.36 a share from operations. Analysts are expecting the life insurer to perform well in 2007 after Prudential raised its earnings estimate for 2007 twice in only a little over a month at the start of the year. Its current guidance is that this year's earnings could reach as high as $7 a share.
