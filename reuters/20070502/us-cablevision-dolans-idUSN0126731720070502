 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The Dolan family, which controls Cablevision Systems Corp. ( CVC.N ), was in advanced talks with the Long Island, New York cable operator to take the company private, The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times reported on Tuesday. 

 The company could sell itself to the Dolans for about $36 a share or $10.5 billion in cash, the Times reported, citing people involved in the discussions. The Cablevision board is meeting to finalize the deal, and an announcement could come within the next several hours, the Times cited its sources as saying. The family has made at least two earlier offers to buy the company in the past few years. Cablevision declined to comment.
