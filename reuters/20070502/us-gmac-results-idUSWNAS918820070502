 DETROIT  (Reuters) - General Motors Corp.'s ( GM.N ) former finance arm, GMAC, posted a first-quarter loss on Wednesday as pressure on the U.S. mortgage market forced the company to take charges at its housing finance unit. 

 GMAC, in which GM retains a 49 percent stake, posted a net loss of $305 million, compared with a profit of $495 million a year earlier. GMAC's mortgage unit, ResCap, posted a quarterly loss of $910 million, more than offsetting gains from its insurance and auto finance divisions, which earned $605 million. GMAC said it had taken steps to lower the risks for ResCap by selling off subprime mortgages at a loss, marking down the value of its remaining portfolio and curtailing new loans to borrowers with weaker credit. Even so, the loss at ResCap prompted ratings agencies to cut their outlook on the GMAC unit, a day before GM was due to report its results for the first quarter. "Looking forward, you can't have any confidence in GMAC's overall numbers," said Brad Rubin, an analyst at BNP Paribas in New York. "I'm not comfortable with GMAC having positive results for the rest of the year." ResCap's difficulties follow the recent withdrawal by a number of lenders from the U.S. subprime mortgage market amid rising defaults and late payments in a slack housing market, and concern that conditions could worsen. GMAC said ResCap cut its subprime loan production to $3.3 billion in the first quarter from $9.1 billion a year earlier and increased reserves due to higher delinquencies. The finance company also injected $500 million into ResCap in the first quarter and another $500 million this month to shore up the equity base of the loss-making unit. That $1 billion infusion was funded by former parent GM in order to finalize the sale of GMAC to an investment group led by Cerberus Capital Management. GMAC said it expected a "considerable improvement" in ResCap's results in the second quarter, with "much-reduced" losses at its U.S. mortgage operations. But ratings agencies Moody's Investors Service and Fitch Ratings cut their outlook for ResCap to "negative" from "stable" following GMAC's results. "The negative rating outlook for ResCap reflects concerns about the execution risks of ResCap's strategic plan to return its residential finance group to sound and stable profitability," Philip Kibel, Moody's senior vice president, said in a statement. Kibel also said the ratings agency was concerned about ResCap's continued exposure to the subprime market. Fitch had similar concerns. "Although the company's exposure to this business has diminished significantly, the effects of higher delinquencies and depressed asset valuations continue to linger," the ratings agency said in a statement. Yields on ResCap's bonds rose relative to Treasury yields as investors demanded more compensation for risks. Yields on its 6.5 percent notes due in 2013 rose to 206 basis points over Treasury yields, up from 197 basis points on April 30, the previous significant trade, according to MarketAxess.
