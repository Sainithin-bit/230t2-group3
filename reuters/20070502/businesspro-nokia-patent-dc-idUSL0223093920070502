 HELSINKI  (Reuters) - New Zealand-based company Michael S 
Sutton Ltd. has filed a complaint against Nokia ( NOK1V.HE ) in 
the United States for infringing a data packaging technology 
patent and is seeking damages, court documents showed. 

  The complaint -- which says the world's top cellphone maker 
is using in its messaging applications technology patented by 
Sutton -- was filed in United States District Court for the 
Eastern District of Texas on April 30.  Nokia said it would actively defend its rights in the case.  "This case was previously filed against Nokia and then 
voluntarily dismissed by the plaintiff. We will analyze the 
details of the new case which was filed on 30 April, 2007 and 
actively defend the rights of Nokia," a spokeswoman said.  Legal rows in the wireless industry have increased as the 
complexity of technologies in phones grows.  Nokia is currently in a major dispute with U.S. Qualcomm 
( QCOM.O ) on a cross-licensing agreement between the two firms.
