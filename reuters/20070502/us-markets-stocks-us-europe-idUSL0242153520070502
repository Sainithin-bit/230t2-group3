 LONDON  (Reuters) - U.S. shares are seen up on Wednesday amid more corporate results and as the effect lingers of a surprise $5 billion bid for Dow Jones & Co. Inc. DJ.N by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp NWSa.N. 

 Results from Cigna ( CI.N ), Prudential ( PRU.N ) and Time Warner ( TWX.N ) among others will be in focus, after recent upbeat earnings have helped underpin stock markets. Stock index futures DJM7 SPM7 NDM7 were up 0.3 percent, pointing to a higher opening, after news of the News Corp NWS.N offer for the publisher of the Wall Street Journal helped the Dow Jones industrial average to set a new closing high in the previous session. Time Warner reported first-quarter profit that beat Wall Street expectations on Wednesday, boosted by a rise in new cable video, Internet and phone subscribers and AOL advertising sales. "The (earnings) numbers have been good and we also had some good economic numbers yesterday. I think at some stage the market is going to pause (because of) nothing more sophisticated than the fact that it's gone up a lot in a short period of time," said Jonathan Monk, senior portfolio manager at Aerion Fund Management. "You wonder whether once earnings are out of the way and people go back into concentrating on economic numbers, they might start to get more concerned about the economy." Recent U.S. data has been mixed, with releases on Tuesday showing manufacturing last month expanded at its fastest pace in almost a year but pending home sales in March fell to their lowest in four years. But there are fears that the slowdown in the housing market -- which is seen as a key engine of growth -- could eventually drag on other sectors of the economy. Investors will eye U.S. ADP employment report this session, only two days ahead of key U.S. jobs figures. Positive news on the earnings front has left sentiment largely unscathed while stock markets have also benefited from ongoing takeover talk and activity. Beckman Coulter Inc. BEC.N, which makes medical instruments and genetic analysis testing kits, posted a rise in its first-quarter profit and said earlier it had raised its bid for Biosite Inc. BSTE.O by $5 per share to about $1.67 billion in total. Fast-food company Yum Brands Inc. ( YUM.N ) reported a 14 percent rise in quarterly net profit after European markets closed on Tuesday and raised its 2007 earnings outlook. Meanwhile, the Dolan family, which controls Cablevision Systems Corp. ( CVC.N ), was in advanced talks with the Long Island, New York cable operator to take the company private, the The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times reported on Tuesday.
