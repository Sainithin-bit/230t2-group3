 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Clorox Co. ( CLX.N ) posted a better-than-expected rise in quarterly profit on Wednesday, driven by sales and volume growth in all of its businesses, but lowered its profit expectations for the current quarter due in part to increased commodity costs and spending plans. 

 Earnings rose 17.3 percent to $129 million, or 84 cents per share, in the fiscal third quarter ended March 31, from $110 million, or 72 cents per share, a year earlier. Clorox had forecast a profit of 74 cents to 80 cents per share, while analysts, on average, expected a profit of 77 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Sales rose 7.3 percent to $1.24 billion, topping analysts' average forecast of $1.2 billion. Volume, which excludes price fluctuations, increased 8 percent after falling 1 percent in the second quarter. Growth was driven in part by increased shipments of home care products such as Clorox disinfecting wipes, which are being promoted at stores in North America in response to stepped-up competition. The volume growth outpaced expectations. "The return of volume!" Bank of America equity analyst April Scee said in a research note. Scee rates the shares "neutral" and said they should rise despite "lackluster guidance." Shares of Clorox, known for its namesake bleach, rose less than 1 percent to a high after falling in early trading. NEW STRATEGY Chairman and Chief Executive Donald Knauss, who joined Clorox in October, is set to outline the company's strategy in a meeting with investors later in May. The company did not divulge details of that plan, but said it expects to bear costs in the fourth quarter and in fiscal 2008. Clorox said its fourth-quarter profit should also be pressured by higher prices for soybean oil and corn starch and spending on the bleach businesses in Canada and Latin America that it bought from Colgate-Palmolive Co. ( CL.N ). The company now expects fourth-quarter earnings of $1.05 to $1.11 per share, versus a prior target of $1.10 to $1.16 per share. Analysts, on average, called for earnings of $1.15 per share. Clorox still expects 3 percent to 5 percent sales growth in the quarter, including the impact of poor April weather on seasonal businesses such as charcoal and auto-care products. For the full year, Clorox narrowed its forecast for earnings from continuing operations to $3.21 to $3.27 per share from $3.20 to $3.28 per share and said sales should rise about 5 percent, versus a prior target of 3 percent to 5 percent. For fiscal 2008, Clorox forecast 3 percent to 5 percent sales growth and a slight hit from commodity costs. Clorox said that while resin costs should be favorable next year, costs are expected to increase for other commodities such as agricultural products. It also expects pressure in manufacturing and logistics costs. Such issues should be offset by cost savings, the company said. Clorox said it would give more details on its 2008 outlook during its May 24 meeting. Shares of Oakland, California-based Clorox were up 22 cents, or 0.3 percent, at $67.98 after hitting a high of $68.24 and falling as low as $65.76 in morning trade.
