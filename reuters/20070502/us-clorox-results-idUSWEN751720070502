 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Clorox Co. ( CLX.N ) posted a better-than-expected rise in quarterly profit on Wednesday, driven by sales and volume growth in all of its businesses. 

 The company, known for its namesake bleach, earned $129 million, or 84 cents per share, in the fiscal third quarter ended March 31, compared with a profit of $110 million, or 72 cents per share, a year earlier. Clorox had forecast a profit of 74 cents to 80 cents per share, while analysts, on average, had expected a profit of 77 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Last year, Clorox raised prices on several items, such as Brita water filters and Glad trash bags, to help offset higher commodity costs. Shares of Oakland, California-based Clorox hit a high of $68.15 on Tuesday. Chairman and Chief Executive Donald Knauss, who joined Clorox in October, is set to outline the company's strategy in a meeting with investors in May.
