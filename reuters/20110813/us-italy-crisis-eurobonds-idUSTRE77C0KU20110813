 ROME  (Reuters) - Italian Economy Minister Giulio Tremonti repeated his call on Saturday for common European bonds, saying they would be the best solution for a euro zone debt crisis which he said risked spreading to other countries. 

 Speaking a day after the government adopted a 45.5 billion euro package of spending cuts and tax hikes aimed at restoring confidence in Italy's public finances, Tremonti made a renewed plea for common debt issuance in the euro zone. "A greater degree of integration and consolidation of public finances in Europe is necessary," Tremonti told a news conference to explain the austerity package. "The best solution would have been the euro bond, with various possible models which could have been adopted," he said. (Reporting by  Gavin Jones  and  James Mackenzie )
