 OMAHA, Nebraska  (Reuters) - Berkshire Hathaway ( BRKa.N ) ( BRKb.N ) is looking at two large acquisitions on the scale of its $9 billion cash purchase of chemical company Lubrizol Corp LZ.N, Berkshire Chief Executive Warren Buffett said on Saturday. 

 Buffett said the conglomerate would not be looking at deals larger than that size for the moment. He said in late February that he was on the hunt for acquisitions to add margin growth to Berkshire's non-insurance businesses. (Reporting by  Ben Berkowitz )
