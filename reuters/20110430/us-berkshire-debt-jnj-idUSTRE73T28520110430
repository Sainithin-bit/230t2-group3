 OMAHA, Nebraska  (Reuters) - Warren Buffett criticized Johnson & Johnson, a large investment for his company Berkshire Hathaway Inc, for using too much of its own stock in a planned $21.7 billion takeover of Swiss medical devices maker Synthes Inc. 

 Speaking on Saturday at Berkshire's annual meeting in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett said he would like the acquisition more if Johnson & Johnson used only cash to make it. He said the stock component suggested that Johnson & Johnson management was undervaluing its own shares. The comments recall Buffett's criticism last year of Kraft Foods Inc, another large Berkshire holding, for using its own stock to fund a takeover of British chocolate maker Cadbury Plc, and sell a pizza business to Nestle SA. "I would have voted to keep my pizza and not do Cadbury," Buffett said at last year's Berkshire meeting. Berkshire said it ended 2010 with a roughly $2.79 billion investment in Johnson & Johnson common stock. (Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York)
