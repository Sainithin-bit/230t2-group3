 OMAHA, Nebraska  (Reuters) - Warren Buffett said he made a mistake not to ask when David Sokol was buying shares of Lubrizol Corp while the former top lieutenant was pitching the chemicals company as a possible takeover target for Berkshire Hathaway Inc. 

 Sokol was widely considered a top candidate to succeed Buffett as Berkshire's chief executive. But he resigned last month after it was revealed he had bought $10 million of shares in Lubrizol. Sokol got a roughly $3 million profit on that stake when Berkshire agreed to buy Lubrizol. When Sokol first revealed he owned Lubrizol stock, "I obviously made a big mistake by not saying, 'Well when did you buy it,'" Buffett told shareholders at Berkshire's annual meeting in Omaha. He said the Sokol situation, which has called into question Buffett's management style, is "inexplicable and inexcusable."
