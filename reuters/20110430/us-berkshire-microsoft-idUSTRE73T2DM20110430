 OMAHA  (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp is a value play at current levels but Berkshire Hathaway considers itself restricted from buying the stock due to close ties with founder Bill Gates, Berkshire Chief Executive Warren Buffett said on Saturday. 

 In an interview with Reuters Insider on Saturday, Buffett also said Standard & Poor's was premature in its recent market-shaking move to put U.S. government debt on a negative credit watch. (Reporting by  Ben Berkowitz )
