 SHARM EL-SHEIKH, Egypt  (Reuters) - Tecom Investments, a telecom investor owned by the ruler of Dubai, is mulling a joint venture with Dell Inc. DELL.O and said it expects to make up to three acquisitions in the Middle East and Africa this year, including in a mobile phone firm. 

 At least one of the purchases is likely to be in the United Arab Emirates, of which Dubai is a member, Abdullatif al-Mulla, chief executive officer of Tecom Investments, said in an interview in Sharm el-Sheikh, ahead of a World Economic Forum conference. Tecom has been in contact with Dell about a possible joint venture, Mulla said, declining to be more specific about Tecom's plans.
