 DETROIT  (Reuters) - General Motors Corp ( GM.N ) added $18 
million to its offer to American Axle & Manufacturing Holdings 
( AXL.N ) in the final hours of negotiations between the supplier 
and its major union late Friday, a United Auto Workers official 
said on Sunday. 

  Adrian King, president of UAW Local 235, which represents 
American Axle workers in Detroit, said GM's total offer aimed 
at brokering a settlement to end a three-month-long strike 
stood at $218 million.  "I know you heard $200 (million), but they came in with $18 
million to fund (supplemental unemployment)," King told 
reporters after a meeting with union workers to brief them on 
the contract. "That came in at the last hour of UAW 
bargaining."  He added: "That's $218 million that GM has put into this, 
so there's a lot of major players hoping we can bring this 
thing to closure."  American Axle and the UAW reached a tentative contract 
agreement late Friday. UAW workers in Detroit will vote on 
whether to ratify the cost-cutting contract on Monday.  Detroit-based American Axle has said it is under no 
obligation to repay the funds offered by GM.  (Reporting by  Kevin Krolicki , editing by Gerald E.
