 BERLIN  (Reuters) - Germany will not renegotiate Europe's fiscal compact on budget discipline and rejects measures to foster growth that would push up debt levels, a government spokesman said on Monday, a day after Socialist Francois Hollande won the French presidential election. 
 Hollande has said he wants a renegotiation of the so-called fiscal compact agreed by European leaders in March in an attempt to end more than two years of crisis. He has signaled that a new growth pact to complement the tougher budget rules could also be acceptable. "From our point of view a new negotiation of the fiscal compact is not possible," Chancellor Angela Merkel's spokesman Steffen Seibert said during a regular news conference. He added: "We don't want growth through new debt, rather we want growth through structural reforms." Seibert said Merkel's good relationship with France would continue under Hollande.
