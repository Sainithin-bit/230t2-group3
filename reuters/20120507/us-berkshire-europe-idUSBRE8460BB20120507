 (Reuters) - Billionaire investor Warren Buffett said it will be "very, very difficult to resolve" the problems currently facing Europe, though solutions are eventually likely. 
 In an interview on CNBC on Monday, Buffett also said he has been adding to his holdings of two U.S. stocks amid recent weakness. He declined to name the two. (Reporting By  Ben Berkowitz ; editing by John Wallace)
