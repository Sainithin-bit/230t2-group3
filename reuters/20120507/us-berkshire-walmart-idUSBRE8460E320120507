 (Reuters) - Billionaire investor Warren Buffett said a recent bribery scandal at Wal-Mart Stores Inc ( WMT.N ) has not changed his investment opinion about the stock. 
 In an interview on CNBC on Monday, Buffett characterized Wal-Mart's troubles in Mexico as being caused by a group of bad apples who don't represent the broader company's values. He said such an issue "scares the dickens out of me as a CEO" of Berkshire Hathaway Inc ( BRKa.N ) because it could happen to any company. As of December 31, Berkshire's 39.04 million share stake in Wal-Mart was worth $2.33 billion. (Reporting By  Lauren Tara LaCapra ; editing by John Wallace)
