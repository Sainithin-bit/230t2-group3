 VATICAN CITY  (Reuters) - Greece is a solvent country and it would be wrong for it to be given encouragement not to pay its debts, ECB Executive Board member Lorenzo Bini Smaghi said on Thursday. 

 "Incentivizing countries not to repay their debt would be disastrous for Europe," Bini Smaghi said at a conference in the Vatican. (Reporting by  Philip Pullella )
