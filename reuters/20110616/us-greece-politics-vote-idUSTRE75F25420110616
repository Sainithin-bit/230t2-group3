 ATHENS  (Reuters) - One lawmaker in Greece's ruling socialist PASOK party resigned on Thursday over disagreements on economic policy, an official in the lawmaker's office said. 

 The move will not affect Prime Minister George Papandreou's majority in parliament as the lawmaker will be replaced, a parliamentary source said. (Reporting by George Georgiopoulos and Angeliki Koutantou; Writing by  Hugh Lawson )
