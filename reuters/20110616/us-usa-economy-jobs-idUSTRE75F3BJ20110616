 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - New applications for jobless benefits dipped in the latest week but remained at levels too high to put a dent in the unemployment rate. 

 The Labor Department said on Thursday new jobless claims fell to 414,000 in the week ended June 11 from an upwardly revised 430,000 in the prior week. Economists polled by Reuters had been looking for a smaller decline, to 420,000. Claims have been above 400,000 for two months, reflecting a rough patch in the recovery that has led to renewed weakness in an already anemic job market. Continuing claims eased to 3.68 million from 3.70 million in the week to June 4, the most recent data available, while the total number of recipients on benefit rolls, including those receiving emergency benefits under a congressional extension, remained at 7.4 million in the week ending May 28, down about 200,000 from a week earlier. The economy produced just 54,000 new jobs in May and the unemployment rate rose to 9.1 percent from 9.0 percent, and the jobless claims figures indicated June's reading might not look much better.
