 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The White House said on Thursday that the Obama administration was staying in close touch with European leaders over the Greek debt crisis, but expected the common currency bloc to solve the problem. 

 "We're monitoring the situation and developments in Greece closely and we are in regular communication with our European counterparts," said White House press secretary Jay Carney. "We continue to believe that they have the capacity to deal with this and continue to believe it is completely within their capacity to do that and that they will," he told reporters. Financial markets have been rocked by the risk of a Greek debt default, as Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou faced down a revolt within in his party over EU/IMF-ordained austerity measures that sparked violent protests in Athens. "So far, Greece has made significant progress in terms of reforms, but it is important that the Greek government carry on with the fiscal measures and reforms that are frequently under discussion with the EU (European Union) and the IMF (International Monetary Fund)," Carney said.
