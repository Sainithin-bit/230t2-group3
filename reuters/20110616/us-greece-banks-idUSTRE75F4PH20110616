 LONDON  (Reuters) - Private sector investors need to participate in a restructuring of Greek sovereign debt, a group of influential bankers and investors said on Thursday. 

 The Institute of International Finance's Market Monitoring Group (MMG), which contains top executives from Goldman Sachs ( GS.N ), Societe Generale ( SOGN.PA ) and elsewhere, said some form of voluntary participation involving all private holders of sovereign debt had to be considered. "You can kick the can down the road in the hope that something is going to come along. Well, something isn't going to come along in this case, and our group thinks private holders of debt should be willing to look at doing something," said David Dodge, a senior advisor for law firm Bennett Jones and a former governor of the Bank of Canada. Dodge said such a move would share the burden of bailing out Greece and was the "least risky" solution. "The longer you let it go, the greater the chance that another event will come along and create a bigger problem." The MMG is an independent forum that was set up in late 2008 following the financial crisis for private sector participants to look at systemic risks and confer with governments and regulators. It met on Thursday in London. Attendees included Craig Broderick, chief risk officer at Goldman Sachs, Jerry del Missier, president of Barclays Capital ( BARC.L ), Michel Peretie, CEO of Societe Generale's investment bank and senior executives from UBS ( UBSN.VX ), Credit Suisse ( CSGN.VX ), Deutsche Bank ( DBKGn.DE ), HSBC Global Asset Management and elsewhere.
