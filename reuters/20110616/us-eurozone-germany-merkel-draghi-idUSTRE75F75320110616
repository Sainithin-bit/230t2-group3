 BERLIN  (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel has assured Mario Draghi, the anointed successor to Jean-Claude Trichet as president of the ECB, of her cooperation in his new office, a government spokesman said after the two met in Berlin. 

 The meeting between Merkel and Draghi took place in a constructive atmosphere, the spokesman added without providing any further details. It is believed that the euro zone debt crisis was a key subject of their meeting. Merkel will also meet French President Nicolas Sarkozy in Berlin on Friday. In the run-up to the EU summit next week, Europe's paymaster Germany is insisting that the banks, pension funds and insurance firms that hold Greek debt swap their bonds for new ones with maturities that are seven years longer. Fearful that this solution could create a "credit event" that would prompt rating agencies to label Greece in default, the ECB, European Commission and France all favor a softer option in which holders of Greek bonds would be asked to buy new Greek debt as their holdings mature. The Merkel meeting with Draghi was to try to resolve the impasse. (Reporting by Andreas Rinke; writing by  Erik Kirschbaum ; editing by  Diane Craft )
