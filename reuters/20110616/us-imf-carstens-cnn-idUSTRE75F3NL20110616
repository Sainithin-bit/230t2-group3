 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Mexican Central Bank Governor and contender to head the IMF Agustin Carstens said on Thursday that he supports a restructuring of Greek debt as a last resort if other stabilization efforts fail. 

 In an interview with CNN Carstens said from Beijing that aid for Greece should come not only from the International Monetary Fund but also the European Union, the European Central Bank and creditors. Carstens also said that that too much aid could become a burden on Greece. (Reporting by  Herbert Lash ; Editing by  James Dalgleish )
