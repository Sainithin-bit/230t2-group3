 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The International Monetary Fund said on Thursday continued financial support for Greece is subject to Athens adopting already agreed economic policy reforms and approval by the Fund's board of member countries. 

 "Progress is being made in the discussions to ensure the full financing of the program, and we anticipate a positive outcome on this at the next Eurogroup meeting," IMF spokeswoman Caroline Atkinson said in a statement. (Reporting by  Lesley Wroughton , Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)
