 ATHENS  (Reuters) - A second lawmaker in a day resigned from Greece's ruling socialist PASOK party on Thursday over disagreements on economic policy. 

 The move will not affect Prime Minister George Papandreou's majority in parliament as the lawmaker will be replaced, a parliamentary source said. "The future of our children is bleak, political leadership continues on a course of populism and irresponsibility," Hector Nasiokas told fellow lawmakers in parliament. "This is my last day in parliament." (Reporting by George Georgiopoulos; Writing by  Ingrid Melander )
