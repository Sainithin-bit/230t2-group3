 PARIS  (Reuters) - The International Monetary Fund is very concerned by the latest political turmoil in Greece but stands ready to help if the government can win consent for its austerity plan, a senior official said on Thursday. 

 Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou said on Wednesday he would reshuffle his cabinet and call a confidence vote in his government, in the face of continued resistance from the opposition and some members of his own party to an austerity package demanded by its international lenders. "I am concerned the situation has changed very dramatically in the past 24 hours," Zhu Min, a special advisor to the IMF's managing director said. "We have a team in Athens ready to conclude a review and move things forwards but now, given the situation, there is a lot of uncertainty so we are very cautiously, very closely monitoring the process. "We hope the Greek government will have consent in bringing its proposals and we will be able to conclude our review," he said. "We are ready to provide support because it is absolutely important for issue for Greece, for Europe and the whole global economy." (Reporting by  Daniel Flynn ; Editing by Mike Peacock)
