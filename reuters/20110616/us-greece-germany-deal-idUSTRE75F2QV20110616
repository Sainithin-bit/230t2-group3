 BERLIN  (Reuters) - Germany wants key elements of a second rescue package for Greece to be agreed in the coming weeks, but finalizing the deal will probably have to wait until September, a government source said on Thursday. 

 "We want to remove the obstacles to payment of the next tranche of the current aid package immediately," the source told Reuters. "This includes in particular that we agree on the foundation, the key elements and the conditions of a new Greek package. The details should then be finalized in time for the payment of the next tranche, in other words in September." (Reporting by  Gernot Heller ; Writing by  Noah Barkin )
