 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Boeing Co ( BA.N ) said on Monday that it had gotten approval from regulators in several countries for flight training campuses for its 787 Dreamliner, which is due for first delivery this year. 

 The world's second-largest plane-maker after EADS ( EAD.PA ) unit Airbus said its Dreamliner training devices -- including flight simulators -- were ready to be used with training courses. The company has training courses in Seattle, Singapore, Tokyo, London and Shanghai. Full-flight simulators and other flight training devices for commercial pilot training require approval from each airline's home country. The Dreamliner is about three years behind its original schedule, but Boeing is set to deliver the first plane to All Nippon Airways ( 9202.T ) in the third quarter. Shares of Boeing were down 0.3 percent at $72.40 on the New York Stock Exchange. (Reporting by Kyle Peterson; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn)
