 MADRID  (Reuters) - It is too soon to say how much Spain, which markets consider the euro zone's next weakest link after Portugal, has decoupled from the more troubled, euro zone peripherals. 

 As officials from the European Union and International Monetary Fund hold talks with the Portuguese government on a financial bailout, which could total around 80 billion euros, market focus is shifting to its much larger neighbor. The premium investors demand to hold Spanish over German debt fell after Portugal first said it would need a rescue plan in early April, suggesting sovereign bond holders had begun to distinguish Spain as being in a class of its own. But, after Finnish elections saw increased support for euro-skeptic parties, which may threaten to block Portugal's funding plans, and as speculation intensifies on an eventual Greek debt restructuring, Spanish yields have soared. The yield on Spanish 10-year bonds rose to around 5.6 percent on Monday, the highest level since a euro lifetime high of 5.75 percent November 30 after a Treasury bill auction that saw yields jump sharply. "The key driver here is peripheral contagion. Spain has performed really well over the last couple of weeks ... and obviously now looking at what is coming (investors) take this as an excuse to lock in some profits," Michael Leister, strategist at WestLB in Duesseldorf said. Meanwhile, the IMF, responsible for part of any bailout package, has been keen to applaud Spanish austerity efforts and draw a red line between Portugal and its neighbor. "We're talking about completely different cases. Policy action has been taken in the case of Spain," Jose Vinals, director of the IMF's Monetary and Capital Markets Department said April 13. SPAIN IS DIFFERENT The stakes are high in convincing investors that, as a popular tourism campaign in the country once boasted, Spain is different. If the euro zone's fourth largest economy -- Spain's gross domestic product is more than double that of Greece, Ireland and Portugal combined -- had to apply for an equivalent bailout, it would test the reach of the rescue fund and political nerves. The total cost of avoiding default in Greece, bank collapse in Ireland and maintaining untenably high refinancing costs in Portugal, mostly for the region's paymaster Germany, is expected to be around 280 billion euros. If forced down the same path, economists estimate Spain alone could need over 350 billion euros. Spain's Socialists have met the concerns of spooked markets head on by passing a number of unpopular austerity measures, including civil servant pay cuts and paralyzed welfare payments, and structural reforms to the labor and pension systems. The country also enjoys a public debt to GDP ratio of just over 60 percent, around 20 percentage points below the euro zone average and a long way below that of Greece, Portugal and Ireland. Spain's fortunes however hang on the reach of the reforms and the spectacular implosion of its property sector and the still-to-be-determined effect on its highly indebted banks, growth outlook and massive levels of unemployment. Spanish property prices have sunk by around 15 percent since the housing bubble burst in 2008, though with an estimated stock overhang of over a million unsold new homes, values have a lot further to fall analysts say. FAST-TRACK RESTRUCTURING The question mark hanging over property values has forced the Bank of Spain to fast-track a banking-sector restructuring which it says could have a capital shortfall of around 15 billion euros. Analysts' estimates vary wildly for the funding gap in the system when future losses from Spain's collapsed property market are taken into account, but rise as high as 120 billion euros. The banks have been ordered to increase capital ratios -- a measure of resilience -- to tough new levels via private sector funds, but the government has pledged that if banks cannot find the cash it will intervene through partial nationalization. However, public intervention in a worst-case scenario would still be manageable according to Deutsche Bank economist Gilles Moec in a research paper, "Spain is ticking the right boxes." "We recognize that in order to assuage market concerns 'once and for all', a 'shock and awe' strategy might be recommended and gauging the recapitalization needs on a more severe, if unlikely scenario, may make sense. "Even then, we reiterate our view that a buffer in the vicinity of 70 billion euros, i.e. 7.0 percent of GDP, would probably suffice in this case. This would still be consistent with a sustainable public debt trajectory," he said. The real test for Spain will come in the medium and longer term however. The Socialists must show that they are able to turn around an economy which was in recession until the beginning of 2010 and has been stagnant ever since. "When we're growing at 3.5 percent, everyone will be happy, because we'll be generating enough resources to pay what we owe and the worry will disappear, but until that day we'll be in the eye of the hurricane," said head of Madrid-based think tank Fedea Pablo Vasquez. Since the government, whose forecasts most economist believe are overly optimistic, sees GDP growth of 1.3 percent this year rising to 2.6 percent by 2014, markets are likely to be worried about Spain for some time to come.
