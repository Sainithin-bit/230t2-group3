 ATLANTA  (Reuters) - The President of the Dallas Federal Reserve Bank Richard Fisher said on Monday he expected to be at the front of the pack in pressing for monetary policy tightening at an appropriate time. 

 "I fully expect I will be at the front of the pack for advocating for tightening but you don't tighten until you have stopped loosening and we are still in the loosening process," Fisher told reporters. "I still think we have a self sustaining recovery but I expect to have some moments of hesitancy and that may well have occurred in the first quarter," Fisher said.
