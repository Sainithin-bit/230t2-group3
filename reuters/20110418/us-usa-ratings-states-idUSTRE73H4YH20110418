 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. states' and top-rated corporate credit ratings are not expected to change as a result of the outlook revision for the United States, Standard & Poor's said on Monday. 

 "We don't expect to change outlooks of U.S. states simply because we are changing the outlook on the U.S. government," an S&P analyst said on a conference call. The credit ratings agency on Monday for the first time revised its outlook on U.S. debt to negative from stable, citing the gaping U.S. budget deficit and a lack of clarity in the government's ability to improve its fiscal situation. It was the boldest and most dire statement on U.S. debt by a ratings agency so far and led to widespread selling of stocks. S&P also expects "very little" impact on top-rated U.S. corporate issuers, though there could possibly be some public financing and structured finance issues that could see an impact, David Beers, S&P's global head of sovereign ratings, said on the call. S&P will review issuers whose credit has "links" to the United States, and will be taking actions in the coming days, Beers said. "We could revise the outlook when there are individual rated issuers or issues in the U.S. with features meaningfully linking them to a potential weakening in the U.S. government's credit standing, but we do not currently expect many such actions," S&P said in a follow-up note on its website. "We also do not currently expect to revise the outlooks on any AAA rated corporate issuers as a result" of the negative outlook on the U.S., it added.
