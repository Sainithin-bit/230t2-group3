 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Shares of Tokyo Electric Power Co. ( 9501.T ) gained 2.7 percent to 481 yen, while KDDI Corp ( 9433.T ) fell 3 percent to 486,000 yen on Monday after the Nikkei business daily said TEPCO plans to sell its shares in the firm to help pay for costs stemming from the disaster at its Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. 

 Asia's largest utility holds about 360,000 shares in KDDI, or an 8 percent stake, which are worth about 180 billion yen ($2.17 billion) at current market prices, the daily said. (Reporting by Antoni Slodkowski; Editing by  Joseph Radford )
