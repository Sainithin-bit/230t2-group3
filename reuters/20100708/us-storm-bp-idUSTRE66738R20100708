 HOUSTON  (Reuters) - BP Plc said on Thursday that none of its crude oil production at the Atlantis, Holstein, Mad Dog and Thunder Horse platforms in the Gulf of Mexico was shut by a tropical disturbance, but nonessentials have been evacuated from those sites. 

 The company said nonessential workers would begin returning to those platforms as the disorganized disturbance passes on shore, which is forecast for Thursday. BP began evacuating the workers on Monday. (Reporting by  Erwin Seba )
