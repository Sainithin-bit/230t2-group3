 (Reuters) - Here are some of the austerity measures implemented by governments in the euro zone: 

 * GREECE: -- Greek lawmakers approved a pension reform bill which raises the retirement age and curbs early pensions, a key element of an EU/IMF bailout aimed at pulling the country out of a debt crisis. -- It plans to narrow its budget shortfall from 13.6 percent of GDP in 2009 to 8.1 percent this year, 7.6 percent in 2011 and 2.6 percent in 2014.

The vote triggers a process that converts the reform plan into a bill which can be debated and amended by lawmakers. The process can take a year. -- The government in May announced fresh spending cuts totaling 15 billion euros in 2010 and 2011. Spain's deficit targets are 9.3 percent of GDP in 2010 and 6 percent in 2011, compared to 11.2 percent in 2009.

Here are details of cuts and measures: -- Plans to raise the retirement age to 62 from 60 by 2018, make people work longer for a full pension and raise public sector contributions to private sector levels. -- Top rate of income tax will be raised to 41 percent from 40 percent to help fund the pension regime. -- Taxes on capital gains and investment income will also rise by a point. -- France said it will freeze all spending, except pensions and interest payments on government debt, between 2011-2013 and cut state operating costs by 10 percent over that period. -- Around 1,700 public buildings will be sold off. Total office space will be cut by more than 500,000 m2 in three years. -- State intervention spending such as subsidies and social support will be cut by 10 percent. -- France will make savings on its defense budget of 3.5 billion euros in 2011-2013, a source close to the issue said. * PORTUGAL: -- Portugal's parliament approved the government's austerity package in June to speed up a reduction in the budget deficit to 7.3 percent of GDP in 2010 and 4.6 percent in 2011, from 9.4 percent in 2009. The government said it aims to save 2 billion euros in 2010. -- Portugal ruled out drawing on the euro zone aid package, citing a successful bond sale and economic recovery in Q1. -- Prime Minister Jose Socrates and opposition leader Pedro Passos Coelho drew up steps in June to slash the budget deficit.

In May, Italy approved a 24-billion-euro deficit cut. Here are some of the measures: -- Delaying retirement dates by between three and six months, a state salary freeze and paycuts for high public sector earners. -- Regional and local governments will be pressed to contribute some 13 billion euros of spending cuts in 2011-2012. -- There will be a 10 percent cut per year in 2011 and 2012 in spending by all government ministries.

Ireland's public sector unions passed a pay deal in June, boosting government chances of pushing through further savings in the budget for 2011. The budget for 2010 presented in December projected a deficit of 11.6 percent of gross domestic product. Measures include: -- Cutting public service salaries by 5-15 percent in a 2010 budget that inflicted 4 billion euros' worth of cuts. -- The government has promised no further public sector pay cuts until 2014, looking for savings through public sector reform while trade union leaders agreed to try to prevent strikes and protests. -- Fiscal reform so far: three austerity budgets presented, in October 2008, April 2009 and December 2010, with the first two focused on tax rises. December's budget for 2010 delivered spending cuts of 4 billion euros, including a cut in public sector pay. (Writing by  David Cutler , London Editorial Reference Unit;)
