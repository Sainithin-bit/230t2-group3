 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court on Thursday ruled against the Obama administration and allowed deepwater oil drilling to resume in the wake of the BP Plc oil spill. 

 The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, based in New Orleans, made the ruling about an hour after hearing arguments over the administration's request to put on hold a lower court ruling that lifted the six-month moratorium. COMMENTARY PHIL FLYNN, SENIOR ANALYST, PFC BEST RESEARCH, CHICAGO "I don't think anybody in the oil industry is going to start drilling until this cleared up. But it definitely does not look good for the Obama Administration. This is the second time a court has ruled against them. The third time may be the charm. They may have to give in."
