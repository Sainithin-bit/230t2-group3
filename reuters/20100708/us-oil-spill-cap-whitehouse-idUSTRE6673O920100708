 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The White House is sending BP Plc a list of questions about its efforts to cap a gushing oil well in the Gulf of Mexico and is ordering the company to respond within 24 hours, a U.S. official said on Thursday. 

 The letter from the White House comes after Retired U.S. Coast Guard Admiral Thad Allen, the top official overseeing the spill response, said BP is ready to switch caps at the wellhead as part of an effort to capture more of the oil. (Reporting by  Caren Bohan , writing by Matt Spetalnick)
