 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court on Thursday ruled against the Obama administration and allowed deepwater oil drilling to resume in the wake of the BP Plc oil spill. 

 The news had no immediate impact on shares of BP, Anadarko, Transocean, Halliburton and other related companies. COMMENTARY JIM AWAD, MANAGING DIRECTOR, ZEPHYR MANAGEMENT "Tonight's decision is not conclusive. There are more battles to come. The Obama administration has stated that if they're defeated, they'll introduce a way around it. I think the Obama administration is committed to fighting it. It's not over yet. "They will introduce a new proposal that will negate whatever the legal reason was that they lost this round. "This is not a market-moving event at all. Investors will be more focused on earnings reports next week and what companies say about the outlook for the third quarter and the economy. This is not significant." PHIL FLYNN, SENIOR ANALYST, PFC BEST RESEARCH, CHICAGO "I don't think anybody in the oil industry is going to start drilling until this cleared up. But it definitely does not look good for the Obama Administration. This is the second time a court has ruled against them. The third time may be the charm. They may have to give in." ERIC MILITO, DIRECTOR OF UPSTREAM INDUSTRY OPERATIONS, AMERICAN PETROLEUM INSTITUTE "It's a positive ruling in the respect that they denied the government's request for a stay. If you look at all the actions of the government since the incident, we've seen them take a lot of steps and measures, in conjunction with the industry, to improve safety. That includes inspecting all the drilling rigs that are at work and coming out with new requirements for offshore operations. "Even though this is a positive ruling for the industry, we believe we're in a position to go back to work in a safe and responsible way. We hope the government is now looking at ways to quickly get the industry back in operation and preserve all those jobs that are central to the Gulf region." JOSEPH BATTIPAGLIA, MARKET STRATEGIST, STIFEL NICOLAUS "On balance, it was expected...It will have a positive effect, particularly on the drillers to the extent that operations can resume. "It is a welcome, positive development. "The situation is now to a degree murkier, in that you're still not out of the woods yet in terms of how they can operate in the Gulf...For the moment, the drilling can resume in the Gulf and keep the supply chain moving. Long term, costs of doing business in the Gulf will materially rise." GARY SHILLING, PRESIDENT, A. GARY SHILLING & CO, SPRINGFIELD, NJ "It's good news for the industry and people employed by it, but the government can still slow the drilling down by using regulations and demanding environmental impact statements. On the other hand, Obama is under pressure from governors to create jobs, so overall I expect the government to slow things only moderately." PETER KENNY, MANAGING DIRECTOR, KNIGHT CAPITAL MARKETS "I don't think there's a single energy insider who didn't expect this...This will be good for the market, good for the energy space. "If you think about the long-term implications of what might have been if it (the moratorium) had been left standing, it could've gone a long way to tightening supply and really driven up prices. "The lifting of this moratorium will go a long way in terms of keeping the deepwater drilling industry viable and reliable. "There will likely be a move higher in the space, but I don't expect a violent move higher. I think most energy insiders expected the Obama administration's efforts to be stymied." BILL STRAZZULLO, PARTNER AND CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, BELL CURVE TRADING IN BOSTON "The market will think that with no moratorium, this will take the pressure off crude oil prices, which would be good for the industry and a plus for the overall stock market." DAN PICKERING, HEAD OF RESEARCH, TUDOR, PICKERING, HOLT & CO "Effectively the government's getting what they want by default. It's too risky for companies to start up the deepwater drilling process when you know the rug could be pulled out from underneath you. In practical terms, the industry is still in the same holding pattern that it has been in." RICHARD SICHEL, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, PHILADELPHIA TRUST CO "You could look at it as fairly positive for less government intervention, well-meaning intervention, but people in the area will welcome it. "You could see some positive reaction, more likely drillers and service companies."
