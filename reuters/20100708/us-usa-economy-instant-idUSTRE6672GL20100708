 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - New U.S. claims for unemployment insurance fell more than expected last week, government data showed on Thursday, while the number of people continuing to receive benefits in the final week of June was the lowest in seven months. 

 KEY POINTS: * Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 21,000 to a seasonally adjusted 454,000 in the week ended July 3, the lowest level since early May, the Labor Department said. * Analysts polled by Reuters had expected claims to fall to 460,000 from the previously reported 472,000, which was revised up to 475,000 in Thursday's report. * The four-week moving average of new jobless claims, seen as a better measure of underlying labor market trends, fell 1,250 to 466,000. COMMENTS: JOHN CANALLY, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST AND ECONOMIST, LPL FINANCIAL, BOSTON: "The continuing claims are being impacted by the failure of Congress to pass the extended benefits, so it's hard to tell there whether it's really people falling off the unemployment rolls or if it's people who have lost their benefits. "On the weekly claims it appears to be a little bit of a holiday distortion and the Labor Department told us the fact that GM did not shut down was not in this data, so I expect next week's data to be even better. "There's a lot of distortions in the claims data, unfortunately -- holidays, the Gulf of Mexico spill, GM and the not extended unemployment benefits. It makes it messy but the market was oversold and due for a bounce so it might latch onto this  morning." ALAN LANCZ, PRESIDENT, ALAN B. LANCZ & ASSOCIATES INC., TOLEDO, OHIO: "I think they're better than expected, which is contrary to what we've seen in the last week and a half on the economic front, so it's conducive to today's (stock) rally and maybe a little bit of followthrough. Talk of a double-dip may be a little premature. Investors jumped on the double-dip bandwagon, but we don't really see (it)." TOM SIMONS, MONEY MARKET ECONOMIST, JEFFERIES & CO., NEW YORK: "On the surface it looks like a pretty decent data release. Obviously it's a good thing that claims are starting to fall here and 454,000 is the lowest we've had since May 8. "But there is a number of factors here that is kind of muddying the waters as far as trying to make an interpretation of how genuine this reflection of the labor market is in this data. "Part the cross-currents are census workers who may have elevated claims data in prior weeks. Some of them don't necessarily qualify for benefits but the only thing that really matters is the fact that they fill out an application. The initial jobless claims data doesn't measure how many people actually get unemployment insurance. All it measures is how many people file for it." CHRIS RUPKEY, CHIEF FINANCIAL ECONOMIST, BANK OF TOKYO-MITSUBISHI UFJ, NEW YORK: "Employment claims are spiraling downward. This is just the sort of thing you expected to see when activity in the labor market, hiring, could be picking up at this stage. What is especially telling is the fact that continuing unemployment claims or the total number of people receiving benefits have come down significantly. This could be due to the lack of extension of benefits, but generally this data looks very supportive of the economy going forward. "I think we are too quick in dismissing the potential for growth in the second half of the year, I don't think it is going to be as weak as earlier thoughts had it. The economy looks pretty solid here." DAN COOK, SENIOR MARKET ANALYST, IG MARKETS, CHICAGO: "The jobless claims looked a little better than expected, but we're still in this trend where we move around 450,000. It wouldn't surprise me if within a month we were back up at 472,000 or something. So I don't see us getting a lot of long-term action out of this, but equities have some momentum from yesterday, and while the IMF report gave a mixed message, it did suggest that maybe 2010 will be better than we were thinking. "Despite some of the retail numbers we've seen today, I have to believe that the consumer will remain stressed until the job market improves. I don't think we're going to see real growth for a while because right now there's nothing to support that."
