 (Reuters) - Here are some developments in BP Plc's Gulf of Mexico oil spill, the largest in U.S. history. 

 TOP DEVELOPMENTS * The Obama administration said on Thursday that it will immediately issue a revised ban on deepwater drilling if an appeals court bars it from reinstating the six-month moratorium it imposed in the wake of the BP spill. * The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in New Orleans, where government lawyers squared off for an hour against drilling companies before a three-judge panel considering the moratorium, said it hoped to rule on the matter by early next week. * Drilling on a BP relief well reached 12,780 feet beneath the seabed, or 220 feet from the bottom of BP's blown-out Macondo well, spokesman Mark Proegler said. MARKET IMPACT/COMPANIES * A Gulf of Mexico deepwater drilling ban has already cost offshore jobs in a nascent U.S. economic recovery and a lengthy moratorium would put the industry at peril, sector executives said on Wednesday. * Singapore state investor Temasek, whose energy and resources portfolio grew by $3.6 billion last year, on Thursday dismissed talk it had held discussions with BP for a strategic stake. * BP shares traded in New York closed up by 1.9 percent on Thursday and shares in London were up by 1.4 percent. * BP shares had lost around half of their value since the spill started after an oil rig exploded in the Gulf in late April, killing 11 men. POLITICS/POLICY * Florida Governor Charlie Crist on Thursday called for a special state legislature session to consider a constitutional amendment to strengthen the ban on oil drilling off Florida's coast. ENVIRONMENT * The U.S. government should halt the planned release of endangered sea turtles from an island off Texas because of the spill, a California-based conservation group said on Wednesday. CAPTURE/CONTAINMENT/CLEANUP * BP is ready to switch caps at the wellhead of the gushing leak as part of an effort to capture more of the oil, the top official overseeing the spill response said on Thursday. * Summer storms are pushing oil from the spill deeper into Louisiana's wetlands and temporarily slowing efforts to contain damage. * BP Plc said on Thursday that its oil-capture systems at the leak in the Gulf of Mexico collected or burned off 24,575 barrels of oil on Wednesday.
