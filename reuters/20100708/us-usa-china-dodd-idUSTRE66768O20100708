 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The Senate Banking Committee will hold a hearing on what steps the United States can take to help U.S. workers compete with China after the Treasury's decision on Thursday not to label Beijing a currency manipulator, Committee Chairman Chris Dodd said. 

 "For years, American workers have not been able to compete on a level playing field because of China's undervalued currency and now they are struggling to secure jobs in the midst of a painful economic crisis," Dodd said. "The committee will hold a hearing with Treasury Secretary Geithner to follow up on today's report and to determine what solutions we can deliver for American workers so they can secure jobs and compete," he added. No date was set for the hearing.
