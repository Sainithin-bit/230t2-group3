 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The Obama administration will "immediately" issue a revised drilling ban if a federal appeals court agrees with a lower court's decision to block the government's initial six-month moratorium on drilling in deep waters, an Interior Department official told Reuters on Thursday. 

 However, if the appeals court supports the administration's initial drilling moratorium, the department will not impose a new drilling ban, the official said. (Reporting by  Tom Doggett ; Editing by Sofina Mirza-Reid)
