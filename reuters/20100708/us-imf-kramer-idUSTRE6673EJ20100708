 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The International Monetary Fund does not anticipate a double-dip recession for the United States, the head of the Fund's North American division said on Thursday. 

 "We don't see a double-dip recession under our baseline forecast. The baseline forecast is maintained for a continued, although somewhat subdued expansion by historical standards," Charles Kramer told Reuters Insider in an interview. The IMF earlier released a statement saying that high foreclosure rates combined with high unemployment posed a risk of a "double dip" in housing.
