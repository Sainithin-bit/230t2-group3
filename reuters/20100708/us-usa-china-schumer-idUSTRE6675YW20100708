 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The Obama administration's decision on Thursday not to label China a currency manipulator means it is up to Congress to act, a leading critic of China's currency practices said. 

 "This report is as disappointing as it is unsurprising. It's clear it will take an act of Congress to do the obvious and call China out for its currency manipulation," Senator Charles Schumer, a New York Democrat, said in a statement. (Reporting by  Doug Palmer ; Editing by Leslie Adler)
