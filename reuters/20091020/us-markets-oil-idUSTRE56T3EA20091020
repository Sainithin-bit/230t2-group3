 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Oil prices fell on Tuesday, after hitting a one-year high above $80 a barrel, as disappointing U.S. data on housing starts and inflation weighed on markets. 

 New construction of U.S. homes rose less than expected in September, while U.S. producer prices declined unexpectedly, largely due to a drop in energy prices. U.S. crude for November delivery, which expired on Tuesday, fell 52 cents to settle at $79.09 a barrel after rising as high as $80.05, its highest since October 14 last year. Traders said the weak U.S. data spurred profit taking ahead of the November contract's expiry, snapping eight days of gains for crude. London Brent crude fell 53 cents to $77.24 a barrel. Crude prices have surged nearly $10 in October as strong corporate earnings have fueled optimism about an economic recovery. Oil traders have looked to equities and economic data for signs of a turnaround that could boost fuel demand. U.S. stocks fell Tuesday as the lackluster housing data outweighed positive results from bellwether companies such as Apple and Caterpillar. The dollar rebounded from a 14-month low against a basket of major currencies, with the euro falling below $1.49 after failing to breach options-related barriers around $1.50. "The dollar strengthening coupled with the stock market slide pulled crude lower after it hit $80. And there may be profit taking after eight straight sessions higher," said Dan Flynn, an analyst at PFGBest Research in Chicago. Analysts said that, if prices again surpass $80 a barrel, the rally could gather momentum because of a high density of call options -- a contract that gives traders the option of buying crude at a set price -- at around this level.

"Even $80 is making me nervous," he told the Reuters Washington Summit, adding the government of the world's top fuel consumer would prefer stable prices to volatile prices for the sake of the economy. OPEC Secretary-General Abdullah al-Badri said oil prices at $80 a barrel were "a bit high," but they had helped the group revive major upstream investment projects to create a larger supply cushion. The oil market was also awaiting direction from the U.S. inventory due later Tuesday from the American Petroleum Institute, and from the U.S. Energy Information Administration on Wednesday. An updated Reuters poll of analysts forecast the data will show a build in crude stocks of 1.8 million barrels last week, a drop of 1.3 million barrels in distillate inventories, and a decline of 1 million barrels in gasoline stockpiles. U.S. distillate stocks, which include heating oil, are near 26-year highs and are expected to be ample, even if forecasts for below-normal temperatures materialize in the United States this winter.
