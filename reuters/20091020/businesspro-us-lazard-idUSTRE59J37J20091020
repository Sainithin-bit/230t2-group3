 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Lazard Ltd's ( LAZ.N ) board has no plans to pick a new chief executive for the investment bank at its meeting next week, the board said on Tuesday. 

 Lazard CEO Bruce Wasserstein, 61, died last week. Vice Chairman Steven Golub is serving as interim CEO. The board said in a statement it plans to take a "measured and thoughtful, yet expeditious approach" to naming a new CEO. The next board meeting, scheduled before Wasserstein's death, is October 27.
