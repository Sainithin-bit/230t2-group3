 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A $6 billion purchase of Web advertising agency aQuantive Inc. may distract Microsoft Corp. from any potential merger with Yahoo Inc. ( YHOO.O ), but it does not derail the logic of such a deal, analysts said on Friday. 

 "We believe the odds of a deal happening over time actually increases," Goldman Sachs analyst Anthony Noto said in a note to clients after news of Microsoft's ( MSFT.O ) acquisition of online advertising company aQuantive AQNT.O. Several newspapers reported this month that Microsoft was considering a deal worth an estimated $40 billion to $50 billion to acquire Yahoo. A source close to the situation subsequently said at the time that any talks had cooled. Noto argued aQuantive does not plug the gap in Microsoft's Internet strategy, and "Yahoo remains the logical asset to fill the strategic hole." Shares of Yahoo leapt 4.1 percent, or $1.18, to $29.75 on Nasdaq on speculation in the Web advertising market and wider media business about an eventual Microsoft bid for Yahoo. Stifel Nicolaus analyst Scott Devitt was skeptical, however, saying Microsoft's $6 billion deal, its largest-ever acquisition, could be a prelude to a series of deals in which Microsoft assembles its own alternative to Yahoo. "It lowers the probability that Microsoft is buying Yahoo, at least in the near term," Devitt said after Microsoft's agreement to pay a hefty premium for aQuantive -- 85 percent above the online advertiser's closing price on Thursday. "Microsoft may be more interested in piecemealing together the highest-quality franchises that replicate what Yahoo already has," Devitt said in a phone interview. Yahoo is the world's biggest Internet media company, attracting roughly 500 million Web users monthly to its network of properties. It derives the lion's share of its revenue from a mix of corporate brand display ads and Web search marketing. Devitt pointed to Microsoft's move last week to buy a 4 percent stake in online jobs site CareerBuilder.com, which competes with Yahoo's own job search site, HotJobs. CareerBuilder is owned largely by U.S. newspaper groups. Assuming Microsoft is trying to create a "Yahoo on the cheap," the Stifel Nicolaus analyst speculated that Microsoft could be a buyer of smaller players in the mapping, online video, Web analytics and ad affiliate network categories. Noto countered that while aQuantive gives Microsoft access to additional advertising customers and Web publishers, it is nowhere near the 300,000 to 500,000 advertisers that Yahoo and Google Inc. ( GOOG.O ) have. "The deciding factor on Microsoft buying Yahoo is whether Yahoo is willing to sell," Noto said.
