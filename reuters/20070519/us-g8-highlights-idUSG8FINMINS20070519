 POTSDAM, Germany  (Reuters) - Following are highlights from the G8 finance ministers meeting in Potsdam, near Berlin. 

 (For G8 wrap, please click on) ROBERT KIMMITT, UNITED STATES ON WORLD BANK "I'm flattered to be associated with an institution like the World Bank. I have a day job as Deputy Secretary of the Treasury. I'm going to continue to do that as best I can." "Any discussion of names, mine or anyone else's, at this point in time is just speculation and premature. Secretary Paulson has begun a process of reaching out on a collaborative and consultative basis with colleagues. He is not at this time talking names of people but how best to run the process to end up with the best person to run this important institution." "On Thursday evening the Secretary said he thought the custom of having an American serve as the head of the World Bank has served the world well. "Secretary Paulson said he saw no reason that custom should change and, indeed, every reason why he thought it would be an important for the World Bank to continue to be run by an American. He starts from that position in this conversation but when you consult with people you listen to their views." KOJI OMI, JAPAN ON WOLFOWITZ "We included in the communique that we valued his work and appreciated it. For his successor, given the World Bank's importance, it is up to the World Bank's board to choose. We also need to take into account the U.S. is playing a significant role in the World Bank." ON CHINESE CURRENCY "We think China needs to boost flexibility in the yuan and we agreed on the view that further flexibility is needed. Asked if the G8 discussed a possibility of including China, Omi said: "We didn't discuss (the issue at Potsdam) but I expect related parties will discuss this point and its adequacy from now." ON DISCUSSION OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE "We did not discuss foreign exchange very much." ON THE JAPANESE ECONOMY "Under stable prices the Japanese economy is recovering favorably. As for the United States, there seem to be problems in the housing sector but overall I have a view that things are going smoothly." ON TAX REFORMS IN JAPAN "I have told (the G8 ministers) that starting from after this autumn, we are considering sweeping reform of the tax system, including consumption tax." ON JAPAN'S FISCAL SITUATION, INTEREST RATES "We have to thoroughly reduce national expenditures. At the same time, if you look at the fiscal situation going forward, we will see higher spending due to the ageing society... We will see higher interest rates. Whether we like it or not, we need to be braced that interest rates are going higher in the 5-10 year horizon. "If we see a one percentage point increase in interest rates, (Japan's) national debt will go up by 7 trillion yen." ALEXEI KUDRIN, RUSSIA ON GAS SUPPLIES "Of course," Kudrin said when asked whether he could give assurances Russian gas supplies to the outside world would not be interrupted. "It's linked to long-term contracts. We have no intention of interrupting supplies." PEER STEINBRUECK, GERMANY ON U.S. GROWTH "I know there was a little dampener regarding the first quarter but I guess at the end of the year the U.S. economy will grow by 3.5, 3.something percent." ON GERMAN GROWTH Steinbrueck said the government's 2.3 percent forecast for 2007 growth in Germany was conservative but it was better to be too cautious than raise excessive expectations. ON GLOBAL GROWTH Asked whether he and the other G8 finance ministers were less concerned about global imbalances such as the U.S. trade and budget deficits, Steinbrueck said: "We're less concerned because economic figures worldwide....fantastic." ON THE WORLD BANK "Sure we had discussions on the future of the World Bank. You heard yesterday and that was confirmed by the government spokesman that the Federal government continues to support the tradition that America has the right of first proposal." ON HEDGE FUNDS "The term "code of conduct" is not the term that we had disagreement about, what we couldn't agree about is if (politicians) initiate this approach and our supervisors check it, or do you leave everything to the market and deal with it on a dialogue level. That's the debate we're currently having." "Mario Draghi gets the same echoes that I get from discussions I have with hedge fund managers that there is a growing interest of the industry itself looking at guidelines to create better transparency for business partners, provide better protection for investors and to prevent a potential systemic risk from developing. This is a system that is developing and I believe it's a very positive thing." "I believe the proposals should lead to a code of conduct. "Colleagues from the U.S. and UK say it should not be politicians that mandate for a code of conduct even if it is a voluntary one. "When the industry itself is not mandated by policy and does not get its code of conduct from supervisors but adopts one voluntarily -- (Bank of Italy Governor Mario) Draghi said he can see the intention of the hedge funds to create their own guidelines for the quality of their standards -- we are approaching each other slowly."
