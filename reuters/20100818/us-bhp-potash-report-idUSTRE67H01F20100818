 SINGAPORE  (Reuters) - BHP Billiton may go directly to shareholders as early as this week with its $39 billion unsolicited takeover bid for Canada's Potash Corp, Bloomberg reported, citing two people with direct knowledge of the matter. 

 Potash Corp on Tuesday spurned an unsolicited takeover offer by BHP Billiton, raising the prospect that the Anglo-Australian miner could launch a hostile bid to take the top position in the global fertilizer industry. BHP is unlikely to raise the bid before discussions with investors, though a final decision has not been made, said the sources, who declined to be identified because the plan is not public, Bloomberg reported.
