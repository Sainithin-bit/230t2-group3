 SYDNEY  (Reuters) - With up to $190 million in potential fees up for grabs, BHP Billiton's bid for Canada's Potash Corp is the deal investment bankers globally had been hoping for. 

 However, there was a notable change in the mining giant's line up of advisers since its failed 2008 bid for rival Rio Tinto. BHP engaged Rio Tinto's former defense adviser JPMorgan to advise on the Potash deal. Goldman Sachs, which advised BHP on the Rio bid, may have been shunned by the miner this time round but has emerged on the defense in the Potash camp. BHP also appointed TD Securities, Banco Santander, Barclays Capital, BNP Paribas and The Royal Bank of Scotland Group as advisers. Potash is also being advised by BofA Merrill Lynch and RBC Capital Markets. Thomson Reuters/Freeman Consulting estimates the deal will yield potential fees of $170 million to $190 million.
