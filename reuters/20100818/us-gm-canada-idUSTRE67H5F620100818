 OTTAWA  (Reuters) - Canada's government may participate in General Motors' planned share offering with the aim of reducing its stake in the company, Finance Minister Jim Flaherty said on Wednesday. 

 "Canada may participate in an initial public offering by General Motors, but any decision we take is with the goal of maximizing the return for taxpayers while reducing our ownership in the company as quickly as is appropriate," Flaherty said. (Reporting by  Louise Egan ; editing by Rob Wilson)
