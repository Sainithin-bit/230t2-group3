 MELBOURNE  (Reuters) - Global miner BHP Billiton's Chief Executive Marius Kloppers said on Wednesday the company has not yet approached Potash Corp's shareholders about its $130 a share takeover offer. 

 But he noted that there is a fair overlap between BHP's shareholders in North America and Potash Corp shareholders. Commenting on BHP's upcoming earnings, Kloppers said: "We musn't forget that our results for the year is not yet public but will be in a couple of days. If you look at EBITDA and cash flow figures and I think the analyst consensus obviously accurately represent what we are going to present in a couple of days."
