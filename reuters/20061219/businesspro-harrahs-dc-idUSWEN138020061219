 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - The board of casino operator 
Harrah's Entertainment Inc. HET.N has voted to accept a 
$90-per-share buyout bid by private equity groups Apollo 
Management and Texas Pacific Group TPG.UL, the Wall Street 
Journal reported on Tuesday. 

  The deal, valued at about $16.7 billion, ends a takeover 
saga set in motion more than two months ago, when Harrah's said 
Apollo and TPG had offered to buy it for $81 a share.  The private equity firms will also assume $11 billion in 
debt, according to the newspaper, which cited "a person close 
to the matter."  The Journal said the two sides were expected to say they 
will close the deal within a year, and that the buyers will 
begin paying shareholders' interest expenses if the closing is 
delayed past 14 months.  The deal is subject to regulatory approvals. The new owners 
are expected to retain the top management at Las Vegas-based 
Harrah's, including Chief Executive Gary Loveman, according to 
the report.
