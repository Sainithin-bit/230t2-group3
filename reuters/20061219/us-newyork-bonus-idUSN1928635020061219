 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Wall Street's bonus babies -- expected to collect nearly $24 billion this year -- won't be the only ones crying tears of joy. Tax collectors expect the record payout to boost their coffers beyond projections. 

 Wall Street bonuses are expected to rise to a record $23.9 billion in 2006 from $20.5 billion in 2005, New York State Comptroller Alan Hevesi said on Tuesday. That performance is helping drive up state and city tax collections beyond the estimates made at the beginning of their fiscal years, he said. "When Wall Street does well, New York City and New York State do well," Hevesi said. And Wall Street did very well, thank you. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. led the charge, setting a record for net earnings of $9.5 billion. That works out to about $370,000 in profit per employee at the world's largest investment bank. Morgan Stanley and Bear Stearns Cos. also reported record earnings, churning out profits from hedge fund fees and merger-and-acquisition advice, commodities trading and underwriting debt offerings. Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. posted a 22 percent increase in fourth-quarter profit with strong gains in almost every business line. Goldman's stock is up about 58 percent this year, or more than three times better than the 14.2 percent gain in the Standard & Poor's 500 Index. One huge catalyst has been a dealmaking boom that spans the globe. The value of global mergers for 2006 is expected to top $3.8 trillion, beating the previous high of $3.33 trillion in 2000, according to research firm Dealogic. HOW DO YOU DEFINE BIG? 2006 marks the fourth straight year that Wall Street bonuses have increased. But since 1985, Wall Street bonuses have never increased five straight years, according to Hevesi's office. Hevesi estimated that the bonuses will generate $1.6 billion in tax revenues for New York State and another $500 million for New York City. Bonuses will average $137,580 in 2006, up 15 percent from last year. But you can throw averages out the window because Goldman Sachs Chairman Lloyd Blankfein's bonus could top $50 million this year. Figures provided by Hevesi's office do not include gains from stock option exercises, which could boost compensation "by billions of dollars," according to the comptroller's report. Hevesi said employment in the securities industry in New York City rose sharply in 2006, though the rate of growth has slowed since summer. One new job in the securities industry, creates two other jobs in the city and one job in the surrounding suburbs, according to the report. (Additional reporting by Tim McLaughlin in New York)
