 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Clothing retailer American Apparel 
Inc. is close to a deal to be bought by Endeavor Acquisition 
Corp. EDA.A for $244 million, the Wall Street Journal 
reported on its Web site on Monday. 

  Endeavor, a publicly traded special purpose acquisition 
vehicle, would also assume about $110 million of American 
Apparel's debt, the Journal reported.  Neither American Apparel nor Endeavor were available for 
comment.  Special purpose acquisition vehicles, or "blank check" 
companies, are set up with a management team in place but few, 
if any, assets.  The deal would benefit American Apparel because the retail 
chain would be able to go public without going through the 
lengthy and arduous process of an initial public offering, the 
Journal said.  Endeavor, based in New York, would acquire American Apparel 
for about 32 million shares of restricted Endeavor stock, the 
Journal said. The new entity would be named American Apparel 
and trade on the American Stock Exchange or another national 
exchange, the newspaper reported.  American Apparel executives would stay with the company 
which would remain in Los Angeles, the paper said.
