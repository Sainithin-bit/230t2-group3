 ZURICH  (Reuters) - Swisscom AG ( SCMN.VX ) will repurchase a 25 percent stake in Swisscom Mobile from Britain's Vodafone Group Plc for 4.25 billion Swiss francs ($3.5 billion) in a long-awaited deal to fortify its home market position. 

 The debt-financed purchase, which is more costly than analyst expectations of around 3.5 to 3.75 billion francs, will boost Swisscom's annual profit by around 180 million francs starting in 2007, Swisscom said in a statement on Tuesday. The deal will enable Swisscom, which is majority held by the government, to strengthen its domestic position after the government blocked foreign takeovers, while for Vodafone ( VOD.L ) the proceeds will allow it to reduce debt. The British-based mobile giant said it expected to record a gain on the sale of approximately 100 million pounds ($195 million) for the year ending March 31, 2007. Vodafone said the deal would not materially affect its mobile revenue and profit margin outlooks for this financial year, but could hit its cash flow outlook as it no longer received dividends from Swisscom Mobile. "The 4.25 billion Swiss franc cost is well ahead of expectations," said analysts at investment bank Bear Stearns. "However, with EPS increasing by 9.7 percent, the inefficient balance sheet repaired and returns set to increase in 2008, we believe the deal is broadly positive for Swisscom." WELCOME OUTLOOK Shares in Swisscom were up 1 percent at 457 francs by 1055 GMT. Vodafone's stock was down 0.3 percent at 144-1/2 pence in a weak UK market. "The purchase price at 4.25 billion francs is about 0.6 billion francs higher than we thought," said analysts at J.P.Morgan in a note to investors. Analysts also welcomed Swisscom's outlook for operating earnings of 3.9 billion francs for 2007. Vodafone acquired the 25 percent holding in Swisscom Mobile in early 2001 for 4.5 billion francs not long after the height of the telecoms boom. The group has already been exiting loss-making operations or shedding stakes in operators where it sees no clear path to control under a new strategy that will see it focus on its core western European markets and expand in emerging markets. Last August, it sold its 25 percent stake in Belgium's Proximus to partner Belgacom ( BCOM.BR ) for 2 billion euros ($2.63 billion). Before that, it sold its struggling Japanese business to Softbank ( 9984.T ), marking its first real retreat from an expansionist strategy which defined it for years. Swisscom has sought to retrench at home after a shock government decision one year ago blocking major foreign takeovers. Swisscom faces increasing competition, including from cable operator Cablecom, and falling prices, making it difficult for the cash-rich, state-controlled company to grow at home. Swisscom said the deal would result in an increase in net income and equity free cash flow annually of around 180 million francs net, after deducting financing costs. The Swiss government owns around 58 percent of Swisscom. Swisscom said its net debt limit would remain unchanged at 1.5 times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, thus guaranteeing a high level of strategic flexibility. The transaction will be debt financed and is expected to be completed on December 20. (Additional reporting by  Santosh Menon  in London)
