 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc. ( VZ.N ) and 
five Asian partners plan to build an underwater optical cable 
between the United States and China to meet rising demand for 
high-speed Internet access. 

  The cable, almost half the distance around the world, will 
have about 60 times the capacity of existing lines between the 
United States and China, and be capable of supporting the 
equivalent of 62 million phone calls simultaneously, Verizon 
said on Monday. Most existing cables between the two countries 
go through Japan, slowing service.  The project, called Transpacific Express (TPE), will cost 
the consortium more than $500 million, Verizon said.  Verizon, China Telecom ( 0728.HK ), China Netcom ( 0906.HK ), 
China Unicom ( 0762.HK ), Korea Telecom ( 030200.KS ) and Chunghwa 
Telecom ( 2412.TW ) ( CHT.N ) will start building the cable, which 
will extend more than 18,000 km (more than 11,000 miles), in 
the first quarter of 2007.  Construction is expected to be completed in the third 
quarter of 2008, Verizon said in a statement, adding that it 
would likely see a return on the investment from its first 
year.  "This state-of-the-art cable will support high-speed 
traffic to the world's fastest-growing region -- the 
Asia-Pacific," Fred Briggs, executive vice president of 
operations and technology at Verizon Business, said in a press 
statement. Verizon Business is the division of the No. 2 U.S. 
phone carrier that handles corporate sales.  China is one of the areas with the fastest Internet growth, 
with data showing 123 million current Web users. The country 
has 449 million mobile users, making it the largest cellular 
market in the world.  The cable will connect a point in Nedonna Beach, Oregon, on 
the U.S. West Coast, with landing points in Qingdao and 
Chongming, China. The cable will also branch out to landings in 
Tanshui, Taiwan, and Keoje, South Korea, Verizon said in its 
statement.  Verizon said it is involved in more than 65 undersea cable 
networks worldwide, with 18 in the Asia-Pacific region.  Telecoms competitors are also planning stronger networks to 
Asia.  No. 1 U.S. carrier AT&T Inc. ( T.N ) is in talks with Telekom 
Malaysia Bhd and Singaporean carrier Starhub Ltd. ( STAR.SI ) to 
build a cable line linking Southeast Asia and the United 
States, according to a Wall Street Journal report. An AT&T 
spokesman had no immediate comment.  Verizon shares rose 6 cents to close at $36.54 on the New 
York Stock Exchange.
