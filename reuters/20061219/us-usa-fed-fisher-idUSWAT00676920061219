 LONGVIEW, Texas  (Reuters) - U.S. inflation pressures have stabilized but are still too high and may warrant further interest rate hikes to bring them back down, Dallas Federal Reserve Bank President Richard Fisher said on Tuesday. 

 "I would have to say that the risk of unacceptably high inflation still outweighs the risk of substandard economic growth," said Fisher, who is not a voting member of the Fed's policy-setting committee this year. "On the inflation front, the good news is inflationary pressures appear to have reached a stasis, despite the labor shortages in certain sectors," he said. "The bad news is that the stasis is at too high a level for party poopers like me who will have no choice but to advocate tightening monetary policy further if inflation does not ratchet downward," he said. "We cannot yet say with conviction that we have turned the corner and have this problem fully contained," he said. A copy of his remarks was made available to the media prior to delivery. U.S. growth has been slowed by a substantial slowdown in the housing market, and Fisher warned this correction may not yet have run its course. But he said the service sector continued to grow well and was helping to offset this weakness. "I wouldn't be surprised if the economy proves to have grown at better than two percent, net of inflation, in the second half of this year, then picks up pace in 2007," he said.
