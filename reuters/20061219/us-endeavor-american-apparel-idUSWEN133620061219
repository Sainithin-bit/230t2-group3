 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Endeavor Acquisition Corp. EDA.A, a special purpose acquisition company, will buy casual clothing retailer American Apparel Inc. in a deal valued at about $244 million, the companies said on Tuesday. 

 The retailer, which manufactures all its T-shirts and other cotton basics at a factory in Los Angeles, will get 32.3 million shares of restricted Endeavor stock. Endeavor's shares closed at $7.58 on Monday. Endeavor will also assume $110 million of debt, create a merger bonus pool of $2.5 million and reserve as many as 2.7 million additional shares for American Apparel employees. Endeavor is a company formed specially to make acquisitions. Special purpose acquisition companies are often called blank check companies because when they sell shares to the public, the shareholders don't know what the company plans to buy. The combined company will operate as American Apparel. Plans call for it to trade publicly on the American Stock Exchange or another national stock exchange. American Chief Executive Dov Charney, who founded the company, will remain in that position. The deal is expected to close during the summer of 2007.
