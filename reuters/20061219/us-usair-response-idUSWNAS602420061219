 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - US Airways Group on Tuesday said it remains a bidder for bankrupt Delta Air Lines and that it had expected Delta to file a restructuring plan as a stand-alone company. 

 US Air Chief Executive Doug Parker said in a statement that he welcomes Delta's plan and that it will give the airline's creditors a "benchmark against which to evaluate the competing proposals."
