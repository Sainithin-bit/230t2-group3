 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. producer prices posted their largest gain in more than three decades last month as energy and vehicles prices jumped, while home building rebounded from a six-year low. 

 A spike in energy prices sent the producer price index up 2 percent, the largest increase since a matching rise in November 1974, the Labor Department said on Tuesday. At the same time, prices excluding volatile food and energy costs climbed 1.3 percent, the biggest gain since July 1980, as car and light truck prices bounced back from an October drop. However, stripping out vehicle prices, core producer prices were up just 0.2 percent and analysts said the report did not signal a sudden resurgence of inflationary pressures. "If you take the core PPI changes over the past two reports, they average a monthly 0.2 percent gain," said Michael Gregory, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto. "As such, there is nothing alarming in the underlying trend." Meanwhile, housing starts increased 6.7 percent in November after a sharp decline in October. But permits for future construction, an indicator of builder confidence, fell 3 percent, the Commerce Department said. Stock prices initially weakened and government debt prices fell as the bigger-than-expected gain in producer prices was seen as lessening chances the Federal Reserve would lower interest rates early next year. However, the blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average closed higher as investors shrugged off inflation concerns, while the value of the dollar fell on signs of strength in the German economy. Analysts took the producer price report with a grain of salt, noting that a report on Friday showed consumer prices held steady in November. In addition, over the past year producer prices were up only 0.9 percent, while core producer prices were up a still-contained 1.8 percent. "I don't think it changes the outlook. I don't think this one figure changes the Fed's stance," said Michael Metz, chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer & Co. of New York. The Fed, at its policy meeting last week, held benchmark U.S. borrowing costs steady at 5.25 percent for a fourth straight meeting, while reiterating that inflation -- not weak growth -- remained its main concern. "I still think they are on hold indefinitely," Metz said. Inflation appears to have reached "stasis," Dallas Federal Reserve Bank President Richard Fisher said in a speech Tuesday afternoon, but "the stasis is at too high a level". "The risk of unacceptably high inflation still outweighs the risk of substandard economic growth," he said. HOUSING STARTS STRONG, PERMITS WEAK On the housing data, while the rise in housing starts beat economists' expectations, permits to build new homes fell to their lowest rate in nearly nine years. November housing starts came in at an annual pace of 1.588 million units, up from 1.488 million units in October. Economists had forecast November housing starts to climb to 1.530 million units from October's originally reported pace of 1.486 million units. Still, housing starts were down 25.5 percent from the November 2005 pace of 2.131 million units. Permits for future groundbreaking fell 3 percent to an annual pace of 1.506 million units, the lowest since December 1997, from a 1.553 million pace in October. Economists had expected the Commerce Department to report November permits at a 1.540 million pace. Permits applications were down 31.3 percent from November 2005. The producer price report showed vehicle prices continued to zig-zag from month to month, a pattern analysts have tied to on again, off again sales incentives. In November, prices for light trucks shot up a record 13.7 percent, while passenger cars gained 2.2 percent, reversing October declines. "The auto numbers continue to be affected by new models and difficulties in adjustment for quality changes, so the reversal is not surprising," said Lynn Reaser, chief economist for Bank of America's Investment Strategies Group, Boston. In separate reports on Tuesday, the International Council of Shopping Centers and UBS Securities said U.S. chain store sales rose 1.6 percent last week to stand 2.4 percent above the year-earlier level, while Redbook Research said sales climbed 2.8 percent above last year. Both reports said  warm weather appeared to be weighing on sales of winter apparel. "Sales growth continued below plan at most key retailers," Redbook Research said.
