 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japan's Honda Motor Co. ( 7267.T ) said on 
Tuesday it was heading for a 5 percent rise in global car sales 
to a record 3.55 million units this year and predicted 
continued growth in most regions for 2007. 

  Japan's no.3 auto maker, known for building fuel-efficient 
vehicles and power products, is enjoying runaway demand for the 
remodeled Civic sedan and CR-V crossover, keeping supply 
chronically short of orders, particularly in North America.  To alleviate the bottleneck, Honda will begin production of 
the CR-V at its plant in Mexico from the fall of 2007, Chief 
Executive Officer Takeo Fukui told a year-end news conference, 
adding the auto maker would also double annual capacity at its 
Brazilian car plant to 100,000 units by mid-2007.  The Tokyo-based car maker has already announced a slew of 
new factories and expansions over the past year, including 
plans for a car plant in Indiana to start operations in late 
2008.  In the United States, its single-biggest market, Honda aims 
to increase sales by 3 percent to 1.56 million units in 2007, 
extending its record run to 11 straight years. Part of that 
will be fueled by an all-new Accord, which Honda said would hit 
North American showrooms next fall.  "Most customers around the world want value-for-money 
products, and in that sense we expect to sharpen our 
competitive edge and boost sales," Fukui said, playing down 
increasing competition from lower-cost South Korean and other 
brands.  Honda, the world's top motorcycle maker, also estimated its 
motorcycle sales to rise 3 percent to a record 12.7 million 
units this year, and power products to surge 15 percent to 6.4 
million units.  Honda did not provide a global sales forecast for 2007, but 
said it expected its European car sales to jump 13 percent to 
350,000 units, and sales in the Asia-Pacific region excluding 
Japan and China to also rise 13 percent, to 360,000 units.  In China, which most global car makers consider a 
strategically crucial market, Honda estimated its sales grew 23 
percent this year to 320,000 units, short of the 350,000-unit 
target due to a delay in the sales network expansion at its 
smaller local joint venture, Dongfeng Honda.  For 2007, Executive Vice President Satoshi Aoki said Honda 
would aim for sales of around 400,000 units in China, outpacing 
his forecast for overall market growth of 10-15 percent.  To become more competitive, Honda said its main China joint 
venture, Ghuangzhou Honda, is looking at establishing a local 
automobile research and development center.
  JAPAN MARKET TOUGH  Japanese auto makers are counting on sales expansion 
overseas to make up for tepid demand at home, where low-tax 
660cc minivehicles are stealing all the growth.  Despite integrating its three sales channels into a single 
network this March, Honda estimated its domestic sales would 
fall 2 percent to 700,000 units this year, betraying the 
company's expectations for a rise.  Honda said it would aim to reverse that trend by launching 
a new seven-seater vehicle next spring, while developing more 
competitive minivehicles through its beefed-up collaboration 
with auto parts and minivehicle maker Yachiyo Industry Co. 
7298.Q. Honda on Tuesday completed its purchase of more 
Yachiyo shares, boosting its stake to over half from 34.5 
percent.  Fukui said Honda would also consider introducing in Japan a 
clean-diesel engine currently under development, after 
promising the powertrain for the U.S. market within three 
years.  Honda also said it would invest 25 billion yen ($212 
million) to build a new engine plant in Saitama, north of 
Tokyo, with an annual production capacity of 200,000 units. The 
factory will employ about 500 people and supply Honda's car 
factories both inside and outside Japan.  Further out, Honda has said it wants to boost sales to 4.5 
million cars and 18 million motorcycles in 2010 globally.  Shares in Honda have gained 27 percent in the year to date, 
outperforming the transport sector's .ITEQP.T 17 percent 
rise.  Banc of America this month named Honda its top pick in the 
autos sector for 2007, ahead of Toyota Motor Corp. ( 7203.T ), 
citing its upcoming new product pipeline, volume leverage and 
defensive nature.  After the news on Tuesday, Honda ended down 0.9 percent at 
4,320 yen, in line with the main Nikkei average  .N225 .  ($1=117.92 Yen)  (Additional reporting by  Edwina Gibbs )
