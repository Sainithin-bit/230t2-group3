 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The Dow and the S&P 500 rose, while the Nasdaq pared most of its early losses, on Tuesday as higher oil prices lifted shares of Exxon Mobil Corp. ( XOM.N ) and investors said higher-than-expected inflation data was not necessarily going to lead to higher interest rates. 

 Still, gains were limited as technology stocks were hurt by disappointing financial results from industry bellwether Oracle Corp. ORCL.O and an unexpected quarterly loss from electronics retailer Circuit City CC.N sparked worries about retail store profits. Stocks turned higher, with all three indexes briefly in positive territory, toward the end of the trading session as investors said they thought data showing the sharpest rise in producer prices in 32 years was not likely to increase rates. "The big reassessment on producer prices was that the vast bulk of increase was autos and nobody is buying that there is inflation in the auto market -- there is an anomaly there and take that out and there is no inflation," said Stephen Massocca, co-CEO with San Francisco-based investment bank Pacific Growth Equities. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  was up 27.16 points, or 0.22 percent, at 12,468.43. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  was up 2.98 points, or 0.21 percent, at 1,425.46. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  was down 6.61 points, or 0.27 percent, at 2,428.96. Shares of Oracle fell 4.4 percent to $17.12.  Circuit City shares skidded 17.7 percent to $19.00 and topped the list of the NYSE's biggest percentage losers. Exxon Mobil shares were up 2.2 percent at $77.15. U.S. crude oil for January delivery CLF7 rose 94 cents settle at $63.15 on the New York Mercantile Exchange on expectations that U.S. crude inventories fell due to shipping delays along the coast of the Gulf of Mexico.
