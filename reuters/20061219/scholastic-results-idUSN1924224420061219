rise) 

 NEW YORK  Dec 19 (Reuters) - Scholastic Corp. ( SCHL.O )
reported a better-than-expected rise in quarterly profit on
Tuesday, fueled by improved margins from cost-cutting and
higher revenue from its children's book business.  The results pushed shares of Scholastic, publisher of the
Harry Potter series, up as much as 6 percent to a 12-month
high.  The publisher said it earned $75.1 million, or $1.75 a
share, in its fiscal second quarter ended Nov. 30, up 12
percent from $66.9 million, or $1.58 a share, a year earlier.  Revenue rose 6 percent to $735.5 million.  Analysts, on average, had expected a profit of $1.71 a
share on revenue of $703.2 million, according to Reuters
Estimates.  The stock was up 70 cents, or 2 percent, to $34.38 after
rising as high as $35.73 earlier in the session.  The company reported a boost in operating margin to 22.5
percent from 20.9 percent a year earlier.  "Cost reductions appear to have had a positive impact on
results with margins up ...," Stifel Nicolaus analyst Drew Crum
said in a note to clients. "Overall results for this seasonally
important period ... are another step in the right direction."  Scholastic said it continues to expect fiscal 2007 revenue
of $2.1 billion to $2.2 billion, and earnings per share of
$1.55 to $1.85.  Analysts expect $1.70 per share on revenue of $2.15
billion, according to Reuters Estimates.  But the forecast could change if British author J.K.
Rowling publishes another installment in the popular Harry
Potter series in 2007. Rowling has said the next book, the
seventh in the series, would be the last.  Scholastic has not said when the novel is expected to be
released. The series' UK distributor, Bloomsbury Publishing Plc
BMY.L, said earlier this year that fans would have to wait
until at least 2007 for the next installment.
