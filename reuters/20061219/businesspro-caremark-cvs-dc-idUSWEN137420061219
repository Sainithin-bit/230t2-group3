 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - CVS Corp. ( CVS.N ) filed a registration 
for its proposed acquisition of Caremark Rx Inc. CMX.N on 
Tuesday, a day after pharmacy benefits manager Express Scripts 
Inc. ( ESRX.O ) swooped in with a higher offer. 

  CVS and Caremark agreed to a deal on November 1 under which 
CVS, the No. 2 U.S. drugstore chain, would buy Caremark, a 
leading pharmacy benefits manager. CVS offered 1.67 of its 
shares for each Caremark share.  In a statement filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange 
Commission on Tuesday, CVS said that Caremark shareholders 
would receive cash for any fractional shares that they would 
receive in the deal.  CVS said that under Delaware law, shareholders of both 
companies have no right to an appraisal of the value of their 
shares in connection with the acquisition.  The company also said that there is a $675 million breakup 
fee if either it or Caremark terminates the deal under certain 
circumstances.
