 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc. ( PFE.N ) on Monday boosted its quarterly dividend 21 percent after the surprise failure of its most important experimental drug caused a sell- off in its shares, and gave its new chief executive additional duties as chairman. 

 The world's largest drugmaker, which increased its first- quarter dividend to 29 cents from 24 cents, said CEO Jeffrey Kindler would officially become chairman on Tuesday. "Our decision to name Jeff chairman reflects the board's confidence in his strong leadership and vision for the company as the pharmaceutical industry undergoes unprecedented change," Lead Independent Director Stanley Ikenberry said in a statement. Pfizer in late July chose Kindler, then the company's general counsel, to replace CEO Hank McKinnell, whom Wall Street had criticized for the company's poor performance during his five years at the helm. McKinnell initially was to remain chairman until he retired in February, which was more than a year before his earlier planned departure. But the company, in a change of heart, said that while McKinnell will remain on the board until February, he would no longer serve as its chairman. Company shares fell almost 11 percent on December 4 after Pfizer halted development of torcetrapib, a drug meant to raise "good" cholesterol, due to deaths in clinical trials. Analysts predicted Pfizer would shore up shaken investor confidence by raising its dividend and accelerating cost cutting. "Substantially raising our dividend is an important step in meeting one of our key objectives: enhancing the total return for our shareholders," Kindler said in a statement. The increased dividend would translate to an annual of almost 4.5 percent, one of the highest in the industry, thereby an additional incentive for some investors to hang onto the stock. Pfizer, whose shares had fallen 40 percent since McKinnell became CEO in 2001, had been counting on torcetrapib to garner annual sales of $10 billion or more soon after its cholesterol fighter Lipitor loses patent protection in 2010. Lipitor is the world's top selling prescription medicine, with annual sales of about $13 billion. But drugs typically lose more than 80 percent of their revenue soon after going off patent. With the expected savior drug now scrapped and few other big drugs on the horizon despite the company's annual $7 billion research budget, analysts have said Pfizer will need to buy other drugmakers, or their products, to remain competitive once Lipitor sales dry up. Pfizer said it continues to target average annual growth in adjusted earnings per share in the high single digits over 2007 and 2008. The company has also projected its research and development programs will yield four new medicines a year beginning in 2011 in addition to two products a year through outside acquisition or licensing deals starting in 2010.
