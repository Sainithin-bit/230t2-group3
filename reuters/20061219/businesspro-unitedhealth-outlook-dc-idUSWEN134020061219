 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - UnitedHealth Group Inc. ( UNH.N ), which 
is trying to emerge from a stock options scandal, forecast 2007 
net earnings of between $4.7 billion and $4.75 billion on 
Tuesday, a rise of about 14 percent on better-than-expected 
revenue. 

  The health insurer, which also affirmed its 2006 profit 
outlook as it was set to meet with analysts later in the day, 
forecast 2007 revenue of about $79.5 billion. That forecast 
exceeded the $77.9 billion in revenue expected by analysts, 
according to Reuters Estimates.  UnitedHealth's outlook for 2006 and 2007 includes its 
estimated range of noncash charges for stock-based compensation 
expense arising from the review of its stock option practices.  The largest U.S. insurer by market value also said it had 
largely completed its analysis of adjustments to past financial 
statements related to stock-based compensation expense, and had 
requested consultation on certain issues with the U.S. 
Securities and Exchange Commission.  UnitedHealth planned to review these issues with the SEC 
before completing its restatement and filing quarterly reports 
for its second and third quarters of this year.  For the years 1994-2005, the company estimated charges from 
stock-based compensation at $400 million to $600 million under 
one accounting method that it currently uses; or charges of 
$1.5 billion to $1.7 billion, under a second accounting method 
it had previously used.  UnitedHealth cautioned the estimates have not been audited 
and are subject to change depending on its consultation with 
the SEC.  "We will review our analysis and proposed restatement 
adjustments with the SEC and return to current filing status as 
quickly as possible," G. Mike Mikan, the company's chief 
financial officer, said in a statement.  The company affirmed its previous outlook for 2006 net 
earnings of $4.14 billion to $4.16 billion, including 
fourth-quarter 2006 net earnings in the range of $1.17 billion 
to $1.19 billion.  UnitedHealth is having its first major meeting with 
analysts since Chief Executive William McGuire left in the wake 
of a damaging report that found the company backdated stock 
options.  The Minneapolis-based company previously had warned that 
financial statements dating to 1994 should no longer be relied 
upon.
