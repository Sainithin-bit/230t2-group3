 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ) on Tuesday said it will spin off its Discover division, ending its foray into credit cards, as the parent company capped a record year with better-than-expected quarterly results. 

 Morgan Stanley has been under pressure for years to shed Discover, one of the largest card issuers, which until recently had been a laggard when it came to growth. The investment bank inherited the business in 1997 when it merged with Dean Witter Discover & Co. Chief Executive John Mack -- who a helped orchestrate the Discover merger -- canceled a previously planned spin-off shortly after rejoining the firm last June, arguing the unit generated cash and helped steady earnings. Now after a year of strong earnings growth, Mack says a split will boost the combined stock value of both companies. "I think both Morgan Stanley and Discover can go their own paths and really create a lot more value for shareholders," Mack told analysts on a conference call. "This is a promising asset, given the market's interest in payments companies." Sanford Bernstein analyst and former Morgan Stanley treasurer Brad Hintz called the decision "very good news." "Discover was slower-growing. The longer you hung on, the more it reduced the value of the company," he said. Morgan Stanley shares rose 27 cents to $80.55 a share in afternoon trading. The move comes as Discover reports its best year ever, with income up 72 percent at $1.6 billion. Net sales rose 13 percent, while managed loans rose 7 percent to $50.3 billion. Loan write-offs and the provision for future losses plunged for the fourth straight year, reflecting better credit quality, although Chief Financial Officer David Sidwell warned losses are expected to rise next year. The move will please investors who for years argued that Discover did not fit in with Morgan Stanley's securities businesses and dragged down overall results. Morgan Stanley insists Discover's outlook is bright. A landmark Supreme Court ruling, which upheld an antitrust suit against Visa and MasterCard Inc. ( MA.N ) in October 2004 leveled the playing field for Discover and American Express Co. ( AXP.N ) to expand their payments businesses. Investors have shown they are eager for credit card stocks and MasterCard shares have more than doubled since their debut in May 2006. Visa International also plans to go public. Morgan plans to issue shareholders 100 percent of Discover during the third quarter on a tax-free basis. The bank will maintain its $1.08 annual dividend after the spinoff. STRONG QUARTER Morgan Stanley said net income fell to $2.21 billion, or $2.08 a share, for the fiscal fourth quarter that ended on November 30, from $2.47 billion, or $2.32, in the year-ago period. The previous year's results included a $280 million tax benefit and a $700 million gain from its sale of an aircraft leasing unit. Excluding results from that business, income rose 26 percent to a record $2.21 billion, or $2.08 a share, easily beating the average analyst estimate of $1.77 a share. Net revenue rose 24 percent to $8.63 billion amid record income from investment banking and trading. Advisory fees rose 34 percent to $642 million, the best in seven years, as Morgan ranked No. 2 in completed M&As and second in IPOs this year. Debt underwriting soared 72 percent, fueled by the boom in leveraged buyouts, but stock offerings fees fell 29 percent. Morgan posted record net revenue of $2.3 billion from debt trading, while higher risk taking in equities trading helped boost revenue there by 20 percent to a record $1.4 billion. And so far, the new fiscal year is off to a strong start. "We continue to be optimistic about the prospects for investment banking," said Sidwell, adding the bank's backlog of M&A, debt and stock offerings are all higher than a year ago. Showing progress in its turnaround is the wealth management unit, where revenue rose 12 percent to $1.4 billion, its highest in six years. Revenue per broker rose to $720,000, on par with industry leader Merrill Lynch and Co. Inc. MER.N. The number of brokers, cut 16 percent in the past year to 8,030, is expected to rise by the end of 2007 as Morgan brings in trainees and steps up recruitment, Sidwell said. Net revenue from asset management fell 19 percent to $718 million as investment gains fell. Rising markets helped boost managed assets 11 percent to $478 billion, although customers continue to pull money out faster than they invest. Margins in this business are expected to shrink next year, Sidwell said, as the firm continues its expansion. Morgan Stanley bought stakes in five hedge fund firms this year. Still, Mack does not intend to follow the lead of rival banks and shed this business. "There's a lot of synergies between our asset management business and the retail (brokerage) business, and also the institutional business," he said. "So that would not be a candidate to be spun off."
