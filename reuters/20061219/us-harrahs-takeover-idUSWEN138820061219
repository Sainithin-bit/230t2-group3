 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - The board of the world's largest casino operator, Harrah's Entertainment Inc., has accepted a $17.1-billion buyout bid from private equity groups Apollo Management and Texas Pacific Group. 

 The $90-per-share deal announced on Tuesday is still subject to shareholder approval and a regulatory process that could take a year or more. It marks an end to more than two months of talks that followed a previous $81-a-share offer from Apollo and TPG, though Harrah's said it may solicit superior proposals from third parties over the next 25 days. "I don't expect further bids, but anything is possible," Chief Executive Gary Loveman told Reuters in an interview. The private equity firms will assume $10.7 billion in debt, Harrah's said. "It's a fair price for Harrah's shareholders. The 25 days allows them to say this is what we came up with on our own, now we are opening it up to others," said Robert LaFleur at Susquehanna Financial Group. Shares of Las Vegas-based Harrah's, halted for pending news, were up 12 cents at $82.30 on the New York Stock Exchange before trading was stopped. The stock has not responded strongly to reports of higher bids due to concerns about the amount of time it will take to complete the deal due to casino licensing requirements, experts have said. Across the market, many executives have cooperated with moves to take their companies private, lured by big payouts from the change of control and the prospect of escaping the pressure they face when companies are publicly traded. The casino sector has been particularly rife with deals, as private equity firms seek out new areas to invest hundreds of billions of dollars in new funds. Station Casinos Inc. announced on December 4 plans for a $4.7-billion management-led buyout. Smaller casino operator Penn National Gaming Inc. had also been considering a bid for Harrah's, according to sources. LaFleur said the new Harrah's owners were likely to sell off some non-core assets, such as the Rio casino off the Las Vegas Strip, which would be more valuable to operators like Penn or Pinnacle Entertainment Inc. The two sides said they expect to close the deal within a year, and the buyers will begin paying shareholders' interest expenses if the closing is delayed past March 1, 2008. "They've pretty much put their money where their mouth is and said they can get the deal done in 14 months, and they are willing to pay shareholders if it takes longer than that," LaFleur said. Harrah's board had set a December 12 deadline for bids and then met last week to review the offers, sources previously told Reuters. The talks continued over the weekend, with the final vote set for Tuesday, sources said. A Harrah's spokesman said the $17.1 billion equity value of the deal was based on an update of the outstanding shares it had reported at the end of September, which initially yielded a $16.7 billion value. The deal would rank in the top 10 private equity buyouts this year, which include the $21-billion buyout of HCA Inc. and a $20-billion deal for Equity Office Properties Trust.
