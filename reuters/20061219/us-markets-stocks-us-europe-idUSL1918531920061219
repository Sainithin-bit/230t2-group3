 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - U.S. shares looked set to open lower on Tuesday, with stock exchange operators Nasdaq ( NDAQ.O ) and NYSE Group Inc. NYX.N in focus as a result of developments in their respective transatlantic merger endeavors. 

 Investors and analysts will also be keen on Morgan Stanley's ( MS.N ) fourth-quarter results -- expected to show a rise in earnings per share to $1.77 from $1.38 -- after rival investment banks Goldman Sachs ( GS.N ), Lehman Brothers LEH.N and Bear Stearns BSC.N beat Wall Street forecasts last week. Apart from Morgan Stanley, the S&P 500 corporate earnings calendar is thin, featuring Cintas Corp ( CTAS.O ), Circuit City Stores Inc CC.N and Darden Restaurants Inc ( DRI.N ). By 1055 GMT, U.S. stock futures SPc1 DJc1 NDc1 were pointing to the three main indexes opening between 0.1 percent and 0.4 percent lower. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  fell 0.03 percent on Monday to close at 12,441.27 points, the Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  fell 0.32 percent to 1,422.48 and the Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  fell 0.88 percent to 2,435.57. Oracle Corp. ORCL.O fell 1.7 percent to $17.60 in extended trade on Monday after the software maker posted results that were essentially in line with expectations. Oracle had closed at $17.91 on Nasdaq. Nasdaq, the company, was likely to be in the spotlight after the London Stock Exchange ( LSE.L ) on Monday urged its shareholders to reject Nasdaq's $5.3 billion takeover bid. NYSE, the New York Stock Exchange operator, may see its planned merger with Euronext ENXT.PA move a step closer to completion, with Euronext shareholders expected to approve the $14 billion tie-up at an extraordinary general meeting. In other corporate news, the board of casino operator Harrah's Entertainment Inc. HET.N will vote on Tuesday whether to accept a $16.7 billion buyout bid by private equity groups Apollo Management and Texas Pacific Group, a source familiar with the matter said on Monday. And the Wall Street Journal reported that clothing retailer American Apparel Inc. was close to a deal to be bought by Endeavor Acquisition Corp. EDA.A for $244 million. November housing starts and permits as well as November producer prices are due at 1330 GMT, followed by the Redbook December retail sales index of department and chain store sales at 1355 GMT. The U.S. Treasury releases its semi-annual report on currency practices by key trade partners. Coming just days after Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson wrapped up strategic economic talks in Beijing, the report is expected to refrain from declaring China a currency manipulator. It also comes in the wake of Thai stocks having suffered their worst slump since Asia's 1997 financial meltdown, falling 15 percent as foreign investors took fright at drastic measures to rein in the appreciation of the baht currency  THB= .
