 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. securities regulators are questioning whether investors would be able to undermine potential short sale restrictions through other financial instruments such as swaps and some types of exchange traded funds. 

 On Wednesday, the Securities and Exchange Commission proposed five short sale restrictions, including bringing back an uptick rule, which would allow investors to bet that a stock will fall only when the last sale price was higher than the previous price. In the SEC's formal proposal, released on Friday, the agency asked for comment on whether an investor's ability to obtain a short position through products such as options and other instruments such as "inverse leveraged exchange traded funds" could undermine its proposed rules. This is a similar concern raised by SEC Commissioner Luis Aguilar earlier this week, who said that investors could move their shorting activities to unregulated products such as credit default swaps. "Even if we were to adopt a rule restricting short sales, that rule would be, at best, only a partial solution," Aguilar said at the SEC's meeting on Wednesday. Short selling has been blamed by some lawmakers and executives for deepening the financial crisis and driving down share prices. But traders and asset managers say short sellers are being targeted unfairly for the plunge in stock prices that occurred as the housing market bubble burst and exposed risky bets by financial institutions. Another SEC proposal would allow shorting only if the best available bid on a stock was higher than the last bid. The SEC also proposed three circuit breakers, which would trigger some kind of short sale restriction if a particular stock fell by 10 percent. One of the circuit breakers would trigger a short sale ban on the particular stock for the rest of the day. Under this proposal, market makers would be excepted so they could continue to provide liquidity to the market. Two other possible measures would use a circuit breaker approach to trigger a temporary application of the uptick or bid rule in a particular security. The SEC's 273-page document also asks for comment on whether the 10 percent threshold is the appropriate level for the application of a circuit breaker. And the agency asks what market-wide short sale price restrictions would be most appropriate in combination with a short-selling circuit breaker. The public comment period is open for 60 days after the proposal is published in the U.S. government's Federal Register. Only after that time can the SEC meet again to decide on final rules, if any.
