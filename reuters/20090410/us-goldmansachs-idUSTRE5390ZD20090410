 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc is considering making a multibillion dollar share offering to investors as part of its efforts to repay a $10 billion government loan, the Wall Street Journal reported citing people familiar with the matter. 

 The announcement could be made as early as next week and though Goldman executives haven't determined the exact size of the offering, it is expected to be at least several billion dollars, the people told the Journal. A final decision hasn't been taken and will be based partly on market conditions, the Journal reported. Goldman Sachs, which is due to report its quarterly earnings on Tuesday, is one of several recipients of the U.S. government's Troubled Asset Relief Program investment and plans to repay the money as soon as possible. Goldman Sachs could not be reached immediately for comments. (Reporting by Sweta Singh in Bangalore; Editing by Vinu Pilakkott)
