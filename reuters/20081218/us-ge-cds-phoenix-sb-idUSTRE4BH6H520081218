 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Credit protection costs for GE Capital rose after Standard & Poor's on Thursday said GE ( GE.N ) had a one-in-three chance of losing its "AAA" credit rating within the next two years. 

 Five-year credit default swaps of GE Capital rose to 420 basis points, or $420,000 a year to protect $10 million of debt, up from 395 basis points before S&P's action, according to data from Phoenix Partners Group. (Reporting by  Walden Siew , Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)
