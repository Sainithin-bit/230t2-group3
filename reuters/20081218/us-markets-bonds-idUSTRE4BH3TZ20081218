 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The U.S. 10-year Treasury note yield hit a five-decade low on Thursday in a safe-haven bid as stocks extended their declines after Standard & Poor's said General Electric Co. ( GE.N ) had at least a one-in-three possibility of a ratings downgrade within two years. 

 The benchmark 10-year Treasury note's price, which moves inversely to its yield, rose more than one full point, pushing down the yield briefly to 2.04 percent, the lowest level since the early 1950s. (Reporting by  John Parry ; Editing by Leslie Adler)
