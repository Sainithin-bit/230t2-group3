 (Reuters) - Barclays Capital, the investment banking arm of Britain's Barclays Plc, said it had told the 3,500 U.S. staff who have lost their jobs as part of its takeover of Lehman Brothers, dismissing a report it was delaying the layoffs. 

 "These job cuts have already been announced and are part of the integration process of Barclays Capital's acquisition of Lehman Brothers," a spokesman for BarCap said. The redundancies have been completed. The New York Post had said Barclays was delaying telling employees about layoffs until after the new year. Barclays bought Lehman's U.S. investment banking and capital markets business in September after the Wall Street firm collapsed, and has previously said it would lay off 3,000 to 3,500 staff out of the enlarged U.S. workforce.
