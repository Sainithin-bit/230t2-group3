 SYDNEY  (Reuters) - Australian carrier Qantas Airways Ltd ( QAN.AX ) remains open to airline mergers, especially in Asia, after talks with British Airways Plc (BA) BAY.L failed, a source familiar with Qantas's plans said on Thursday. 

 Qantas and BA earlier called off talks for a $6.4 billion merger, citing disagreement on key terms. Qantas declined further comment, but BA said it could not agree to the Australian airline owning more than 50 percent of the merged entity. The source told Reuters that Qantas was not in any active talks after the demise of the BA negotiations but saw potential benefits from merging with an Asian airline. The source noted that Qantas had had previous dialogue with Singapore Airlines ( SIAL.SI ) and Malaysian Airline System ( MASM.KL ). (Reporting by  Mark Bendeich ; editing by  Denny Thomas )
