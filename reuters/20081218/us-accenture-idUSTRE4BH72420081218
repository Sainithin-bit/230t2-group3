 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Technology outsourcing and consulting firm Accenture Ltd ( ACN.N ) on Thursday reported a quarterly profit that topped Wall Street's forecast, but the company lowered its fiscal-year outlook slightly due to currency effects. 

 Accenture showed revenue growth over most of its operating groups in the quarter, and Chief Executive William Green said the results demonstrated its "relative resistance" to the global financial turmoil. "People are betting their companies on some of the initiatives that they're taking, and we're the kind of people they'll come to in order to make sure they get the results they need," Green told Reuters. He acknowledged a "very somber, very quiet" mood among some of the company's clients. But he said the current business climate can provide opportunities for Accenture, such as growing its outsourcing business. "There's not a board of directors out there who isn't asking the management, have you considered sourcing alternatives?" Accenture said its net profit in its first quarter ended November 30 rose to $479.9 million, or 74 cents a share, from $381.3 million, or 60 cents a share, in the year-ago period. Net revenue climbed 6 percent to $6.02 billion, topping the $5.99 billion average estimate, according to Reuters Estimates. Consulting revenue rose 6 percent, while outsourcing revenue climbed 7 percent. Revenue increased across all of Accenture's operating groups except for financial services, its third largest, where it dipped only slightly. Green said he expects its financial services business to show strength in coming quarters, as companies work through the current trouble. "I think it's going to hold up and then its going to break free," he said. Revenue in Europe fell slightly, but rose 11 percent in the Americas. A majority of the company's revenue comes from outside the United States, and Accenture expects foreign currency exchange to negatively impact its results by 8 percent to 10 percent over the remainder of the fiscal year. As a result, Accenture lowered its fiscal 2009 earnings forecast to a range of $2.78 to $2.85 a share on revenue growth of 6 percent to 10 percent. The company had previously forecast a per-share profit of $2.85 to $2.93 on revenue growth of 9 percent to 12 percent. Accenture also cited "market uncertainty" for its lower revenue growth forecast. The company expects fiscal second-quarter revenue of $5.45 billion to $5.65 billion, versus the average analyst range of $5.4 billion to $6.2 billion. Accenture's shares have held up relatively well in a brutal year for stocks, falling around 15 percent. Shares of Bermuda-based Accenture closed the regular session up 17 cents at $30.41 and rose 50 cents in extended trading. (Reporting by Gabriel Madway; Editing by  Gary Hill  and Gunna Dickson)
