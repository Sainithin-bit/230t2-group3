 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - President-elect Barack Obama said on Thursday ensuring financial stability and lessening economic risk will be his top priority in evaluating any request by the Treasury Department for additional TARP funds. 

 "The bottom line from my perspective is that we cannot afford a collapse of our financial system. Main Street can't afford it," he told reporters in Chicago. "My top priority in addition to an economic recovery plan that helps to spur demand and create new jobs, my second priority, which is reflected by this team here today, is not only are we strengthening our financial system but we are also creating the kind of regulatory structure that prevents the kind of broad systemic risks we've been seeing," he said.
