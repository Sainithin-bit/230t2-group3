 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Standard & Poor's on Thursday changed its outlook on General Electric Corp ( GE.N ) and its finance arm to negative, and said there is at least a one-in-three chance it will cut GE's credit rating from the top "AAA" in the next two years. 

 "The negative outlook is based partly on the concerns regarding General Electric Capital Corp's future performance and funding," S&P said in a statement. "In addition, fundamentals-based earnings and cash flow could decline sufficiently during the next two years to warrant a downgrade," the rating agency said. "We will continue to monitor GECC's success in executing on its funding and liquidity plans in light of capital market turmoil." (Reporting by  Karen Brettell ; Editing by  James Dalgleish )
