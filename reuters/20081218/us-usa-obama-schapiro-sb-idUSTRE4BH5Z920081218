 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - President-elect Barack Obama's pick to head the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said her top priority was to restore investor confidence, shaken by the financial crisis and regulatory lapses. 

 Mary Schapiro, who has spent her career regulating financial markets, said investor trust was the lifeblood of the financial markets. "The only way to restore the trust that has been lost is through effective, thoughtful reform of our regulatory structure and the consistent, robust enforcement of our financial regulations," Schapiro said at a news conference in Chicago to announce her nomination. "This will be my top priority." Over the past year, investors have witnessed global markets lose trillions of dollars and the federal government rescue one financial institution after another amid charges that regulators were caught napping. The latest blow, Bernard Madoff's alleged $50 billion fraud, has forced the current SEC Chairman Christopher Cox to ask the agency's internal watchdog to probe the SEC's conduct in the case. "This is a perilous time for investors. Americans are looking to policymakers and regulators to restore stability and trust to our financial markets," said Schapiro, currently the chief executive of a nongovernmental regulator, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. FINRA oversees broker dealers. Schapiro said the SEC's mission was critical to the future economic health of the country. "Obviously there is much work to the done there, and I am committed to leading an agency whose primary mission is always to protect investors," she said. The SEC under Cox's leadership has been criticized by some lawmakers for not doing enough to protect investors amid a meltdown on Wall Street. "The current financial market crisis requires an aggressive systemic response," Schapiro said. "Modernizing America's financial regulatory system demands that federal agencies work collaborative, aggressively and creatively to meet head on the realities of today's complex market place." Investors are hoping Schapiro, who previously chaired the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and was an SEC commissioner, will be more investor-friendly. "Mary Schapiro has a well-earned reputation for integrity and for putting investors first," said Ann Yerger, executive director of the Council of Institutional Investors.
