 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - President George W. Bush will not allow a "disorderly collapse" of the U.S. automakers and is nearing a conclusion on how to provide them with financial assistance, the White House said on Thursday. 

 "The president is not going to allow a disorderly collapse of the companies. That is not an option," White House spokeswoman Dana Perino told reporters. "We're nearing a conclusion, we're narrowing options, I just don't have anything for you today." (Reporting by  Jeremy Pelofsky , editing by David Alexander)
