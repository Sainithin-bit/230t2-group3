 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Hewlett-Packard Co ( HPQ.N ) said it has lowered its first-quarter results by 3 cents a share as a result of years-old litigation involving EDS, which the company bought in 2008. 

 HP revised its net earnings for the quarter ended January 31 to 93 cents a share, down from 96 cents a share, because of an increase in its contingency reserve for the legal battle. EDS, now HP Enterprise Services, is a defendant in a lawsuit in the United Kingdom filed by Sky Subscribers Services Ltd and British Sky Broadcasting ( BSY.L ) (BSkyB) in 2004. EDS was appointed in 2000 to design and implement BSkyB's customer service system. The agreement broke down in early 2002. BSkyB, which includes News Corp ( NWSA.O ) as a large stakeholder, had accused EDS of deceit, negligent misrepresentation and breach of contract. HP has maintained that EDS did nothing to deceive BSkyB. A court in January found EDS liable in certain areas, but dismissed other claims. HP, the world's largest technology company by revenue, is seeking permission to appeal the ruling. On March 1 a court ordered EDS to make an interim payment to BSkyB of roughly $112 million -- on top of a $320 million payment that HP voluntarily made to BSkyB in February. The ruling prompted HP to increase its contingency reserve. The company on Friday did not provide a new outlook for the current quarter or the rest of the year. HP paid $13 billion for EDS in 2008, instantly making it the world's No. 2 technology services provider, behind rival IBM ( IBM.N ). Shares of Palo Alto, California-based HP closed at $52.03 on the New York Stock Exchange and fell to $51.86 in extended trading.
