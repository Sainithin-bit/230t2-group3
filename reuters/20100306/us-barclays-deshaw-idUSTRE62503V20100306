 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Barclays Capital Real Estate sought a summary judgment against hedge fund D.E. Shaw, saying it was owed $15 million stemming from a loan default, according to court documents seen on Friday. 

 Barclays said it made a $212.32 million mortgage loan to Westland Development Co in December 2006, on which the defendants, named as D.E. Shaw Composite Fund and D.E. Shaw Real Estate Holdings, guaranteed payments. It said the defendants' obligations under a payment guaranty was limited to $15 million, according to the documents filed on Thursday. Barclays said the loan matured on July 9, 2009, and that the borrower failed to pay the $182.7 million in principal and interest that was owed at the time, causing a default. D.E. Shaw was not immediately available for comment. (Reporting by  Ritsuko Ando  and Jonathan Stempel; Editing by  Gary Hill )
