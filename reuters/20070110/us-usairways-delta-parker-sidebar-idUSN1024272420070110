 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - US Airways Group ( LCC.N ), which raised its bid for rival Delta Air Lines DALRQ.PK on Wednesday, is focusing on Delta's creditors and has no meetings planned with the bankrupt airline's management, US Airways' CEO said. 

 "Given Delta management's reaction so far, where the negotiations really turned is to the creditors," US Airways Chief Executive Doug Parker told Reuters in a phone interview. "We would welcome the opportunity to discuss it with Delta management, but right now we are dealing directly with the creditors." Delta's management rejected US Airways' original offer of $8.5 billion, made in November. US Airways' new offer is worth $10.2 billion. US Airways is in touch with the advisers for Delta's creditors and expects to have direct talks with members of Delta's official committee of unsecured creditors as early as on Wednesday, Parker added.
