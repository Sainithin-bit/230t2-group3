 ATLANTA  (Reuters) - Shareholders of Home Depot Inc. ( HD.N ) 
on Wednesday asked a Georgia court to issue an order blocking 
the Atlanta retailer from paying former Chief Executive Robert 
Nardelli a severance package of $210 million. 

  "Nardelli's severance package is a final, indefensible step 
by the board of directors in wrongly overcompensating an 
unsuccessful chief executive," plaintiffs said in a papers 
filed in Fulton County Superior Court.  Stephanie Hansen, a lawyer with the Atlanta firm of Duane 
Morris LLP, told Reuters the papers were filed on Wednesday.
