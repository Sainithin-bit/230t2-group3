 CORALVILLE, Iowa  (Reuters) - Chicago Federal Reserve 
President Michael Moskow said on Wednesday additional rate 
increases could still be needed to tamp down inflation. 

  Answering questions from reporters after a speech, Moskow 
said not to read anything into the absence of a policy comment 
from his speech, after making several speeches in late 2006 
that specifically mentioned the possibility of rate hikes.  "Certainly, additional firming may still be needed," Moskow 
said, adding that he "would never forecast what the (Federal 
Open Market) Committee was going to do."  Moskow, a voting member of the interest rate-setting FOMC 
this year, said the inflation outlook was still an 
"intangible."  "We've had a couple of good months of inflation data" but 
he didn't know if they will continue or not, he said.  Housing remains a downside risk to the U.S. economy, and it 
is "an open question" as to when it stabilizes, Moskow said.
