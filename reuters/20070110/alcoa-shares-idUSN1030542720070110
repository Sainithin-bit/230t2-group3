 NEW YORK  Jan 10 (Reuters) - Shares of Alcoa Inc. ( AA.N ),
rose more than 6 percent on Wednesday after the aluminum
producer posted strong quarterly earnings and a positive
outlook that prompted one Wall Street investment bank to raise
its share target price and profit estimates.  UBS analyst Brian MacArthur maintained his Buy 2 rating on
the company, but said he increased Alcoa's full-year 2007
earnings estimate to $3.09 from $3.03 per share and its share
target price to $37 from $36.  "We also expect Q1 to be better, reflecting higher pricing
in the upstream business, strong aerospace offset by seasonal
declines in consumer building and construction," he wrote in a
research note.  Victor Lazarovici, of BMO Capital Markets, reiterated his
outperform rating for Alcoa and a target share price of $38.
"Our recommendation is based on a positive outlook for the
aluminum price and very attractive valuation," he wrote.  Lazarovici also forecast a one-percent increase in aluminum
shipments in 2007 and a 16-percent rise in the price of the
metal during the year, which, he wrote, would drive Alcoa's
profits higher.  In afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange on
Wednesday, Alcoa stock was up $1.78 to $30.30. On Tuesday, the
stock rose 6.1 percent in after-hours trading after the company
announced its fourth-quarter profit rose 60 percent, boosted by
high metal prices and demand from the aerospace, transport and
building sectors.  Net income rose to $359 million, or 41 cents per share,
from $224 million, or 26 cents per share, a year earlier.
Excluding restructuring and impairment charges, income from
continuing operations was $644 million, or 74 cents a share,
beating analysts expectations of 64 cents a share, according to
Reuters Estimates. Chief Executive Officer Alain Belda said he would continue a
growth strategy and operational improvements that could lift
full-year 2007 earnings by 15 cents to 20 cents a share.
