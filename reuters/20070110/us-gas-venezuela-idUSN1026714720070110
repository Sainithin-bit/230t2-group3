 CARACAS  (Reuters) - Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez on Wednesday recommended the state take control of natural gas projects as part of his intensified program of nationalization. 

 Venezuelan law currently allows foreign companies to own gas projects in the Caribbean state but Chavez proposed a legislative change. Speaking at his swearing in ceremony, Chavez said the constitution "reserves oil activities (for the state) but not gas. In there, it should refer to hydrocarbon activities, liquid, solid and gas." Taking control of the gas sector could affect companies such as Chevron ( CVX.N ) and Statoil ( STL.OL ). Brazil's Petrobras ( PETR4.SA ) ( PBR.N ) also wants to develop the Mariscal Sucre offshore gas project.
