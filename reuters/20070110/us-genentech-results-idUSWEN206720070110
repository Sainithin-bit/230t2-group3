 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Genentech Inc. said on Wednesday its fourth-quarter profit jumped 75 percent on surging sales of Lucentis, its new treatment for the leading cause of blindness in the elderly, and rising demand for its cancer drugs, and its shares rose 1.6 percent after hours. 

 Lucentis, which was almost immediately adopted as the first treatment option for age-related macular degeneration and has been vanquishing the competition since its June approval, had sales of $217 million in only its second full quarter on the market, easily topping Wall Street consensus estimates of between $150 million and $173 million, and even beating the most aggressively raised estimates for just over $200 million. Lucentis sales of $153 million in the previous quarter had crushed analyst expectations of $32 million to $40 million. Genentech, which is majority owned by Swiss drug maker Roche Holding AG, said in October it expected 2006 full-year earnings per share growth of 65 percent to 70 percent, excluding items, and it delivered a 74 percent increase for the year. The company expects earnings per share to grow 25 percent to 30 percent in 2007, excluding items. "It was a totally solid quarter," said RBC Capital Markets analyst Jason Kantor. "The highlight here is the guidance on top of the fourth quarter beat." But Geoffrey Porges, an analyst for Sanford Bernstein fully expects that forecast to be raised considerably. Genentech Chief Financial Officer David Ebersman said the earnings forecast would indeed be revisited. "There are a lot of unknowns, a lot of new products and new indications. We will update the outlook as we move deeper into the year," Ebersman said. The world's second largest biotechnology company posted a net profit of $594 million, or 55 cents per share, compared with $339 million, or 31 cents per share, a year ago. Excluding items Genentech, earned 61 cents per shares. Analysts on average expected 55 cents, excluding the 4 cent cost of expensing stock compensation, according to Reuters Estimates. Total revenue for the quarter of $2.71 billion exceeded analyst estimates of $2.54 billion, as sales of its key drugs all grew by double digits over 2005 levels. U.S. sales of Avastin, the colon cancer drug that in October was approved to also treat lung cancer, surged 36 percent to $490 million for the quarter, also edging Wall Street expectations of about $485 million. Breast cancer treatment Herceptin saw U.S. sales jump 29 percent to $322 million for the quarter, while U.S. sales of Rituxan for rheumatoid arthritis and the skin condition psoriasis rose 16 percent to $550 million. "This fully demonstrates the strength of this company's business model," Bernstein's Porges said of the quarterly results. "You've got strong performance from Herceptin, pretty good performance from Avastin, a tremendous pickup in Lucentis and a nice lift in royalties," Porges said. "Everything seems to be working and they put up a huge revenue number." Ian Clark, head of commercial operations, said the most significant drivers of future growth are likely to be Avastin and Lucentis. Genentech shares rose to $85.06 in extended electronic trading from their Nasdaq close at $83.73. (Additional reporting by Deena Beasley in San Francisco)
