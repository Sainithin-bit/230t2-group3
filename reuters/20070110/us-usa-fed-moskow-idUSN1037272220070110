 CORALVILLE, Iowa  (Reuters) - Chicago Federal Reserve President Michael Moskow said on Wednesday that risks of high inflation remain his major worry even though the most recent news on prices has been good. 

 My predominant concern remains the risks to the inflation outlook," Moskow said in a speech to local business leaders. The U.S. economy remains in good shape and is poised to strengthen during 2007, with a downturn in housing for the most part not spilling into other areas, the policy-maker said. Moskow later told reporters another Fed rate increase to tamp down inflation may be needed, even though he did not specifically address that topic in his speech. "I wouldn't read anything into that," Moskow said, stressing that he could "never forecast" what the Fed's rate-setting committee would do. "Certainly, additional firming may still be needed." Moskow is a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee in 2007 but is scheduled to retire over the summer. He told reporters that the Fed's best estimate "is that inflation will gradually decline." However, "there is still the risk that resource pressures or other factors, such as elevated inflation expectations, could prevent actual inflation from falling in a timely fashion." Moskow repeated his preference for the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index to be in the 1 percent to 2 percent range. The index posted a 12-month change of 2.2 percent in November, down from 2.4 percent in October. "We have had a couple of good months of inflation data but don't know if they will continue," Moskow said. The FOMC next meets on January 30-31 to consider rate policy. Financial markets expect it to leave the benchmark interest rate unchanged at 5.25 percent for a fifth consecutive meeting, and prospects for rate cuts during 2007 have diminished recently in the face of stronger economic data. Moskow forecast gross domestic product growth to average a bit below its potential growth rate in 2007, picking up gradually as the year wears on. The Fed's 7th District president said the U.S. labor market is "vibrant, generating solid gains in real personal income" and providing a buffer against weakness in the residential housing market. At an average of about 160,000 for the past six months, non-farm payrolls growth is running well above the 100,000 a month needed to keep up with the current level of labor force growth, Moskow said. Moreover, the 4.5 percent U.S. jobless rate is pushing the limits of the "natural" rate of unemployment, or the level below which wage pressures can accelerate, even by current standards that put that rate at 4.5 to 5.5 percent, he said. "This suggests that we need to be vigilant for the possibility of increases in inflationary pressures." Unit labor costs have also accelerated because of a recent moderation in productivity growth, Moskow said, adding that "down the road, tight labor markets could generate some larger gains in compensation." Moskow said that the housing downturn may not have completely run its course and that the Chicago Fed expects further weakness in residential construction. But housing market woes would likely not spill over into the general economy, where the strong labor market and lower energy prices have supported consumer spending, he said. The Fed has not seen the "negative wealth effects" on consumption that some feared as years of housing price gains stalled or even started to reverse in some areas, Moskow said. "The economy outside of housing is on good footing, and I expect the pace of expansion in overall economic activity will move back up to trend," Moskow said. "Indeed, many sectors of the economy have been experiencing solid growth." An inverted Treasury yield curve, or one where short-term interest rates are higher than those for longer maturities, has often been associated with economic slowdowns. But Moskow said the implications of the current inversion were hard to peg because of various reasons thought to lie behind low long-term yields. The curve "may or may not" signal a slowdown, he said during an audience question-and-answer session. (To access other stories on Fed policy click on <FED/AHEAD>)
