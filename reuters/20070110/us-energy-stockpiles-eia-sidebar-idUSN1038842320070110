 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. fuel supplies surged last week as refineries ran hard while crude supplies fell more than expected on sluggish imports, according to a government report on Wednesday. 

 Distillate stocks rose 5.4 million barrels, or nearly 4 percent, to 141 million barrels in the week ending January 5 as production averaged more than 4.4 million barrels per day, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration's weekly report. Gasoline supplies rose 3.8 million barrels to 213.3 million barrels. Unseasonably warm weather may have helped keep supplies high of distillates, which include heating oil. "It is probable that there could have been some backlog of supplies somewhere that suddenly showed up in the data. Obviously, the warm weather was helping keep demand for distillates down to below 4 million bpd," said Phil Flynn, analyst at Alaron Trading in Chicago. Oil futures traded in New York were down 84 cents at $54.80 per barrel after the report on the bigger than expected builds. Analysts had expected distillates to rise by 2.2 million barrels and gasoline to rise 2.6 million barrels. Crude supplies fell for the seventh straight week, this time by 5 million barrels to 314.7 million barrels. Even with the draws, "crude stocks remain above the upper end of the average range for this time of year," the EIA said.
