 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Venezuela's plan to nationalize four multibillion-dollar crude oil projects could impede investment in the OPEC member nation and hinder its ability to boost production, the chief economist of the International Energy Agency said Wednesday. 

 Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez said Monday that Orinoco heavy crude projects would become state property, just after ordering the nationalization of his country's biggest telephone company and announcing new reforms to bolster his socialist revolution. "It may well be the case that Venezuela may have difficulties getting enough investment to increase the production capacity as much as the markets asks Venezuela to do," IEA chief economist Fatih Birol told reporters at a congressional hearing. "There may be limitations in terms of capacity due to lack of investments."
