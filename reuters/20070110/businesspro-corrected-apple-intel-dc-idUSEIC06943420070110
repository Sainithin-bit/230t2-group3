  Please be advised that the FRANKFURT story saying that 
Intel ( INTC.O ) will supply the central processing unit for 
Apple's ( AAPL.O ) new iPhone is wrong. Intel and Apple have both 
denied that Intel is the supplier and the spokesman for Apple 
Germany has withdrawn an earlier statement saying it was. A 
substitute story follows: 

 FRANKFURT/MUNICH/SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Intel ( INTC.O ), 
the world's biggest chipmaker, is not supplying the central 
processing unit (CPU) for Apple's ( AAPL.O ) new iPhone, Apple 
said on Wednesday.  "Intel's is not the processor in the iPhone," a spokeswoman 
for Apple in San Francisco told Reuters by telephone, denying 
an earlier statement by a spokesman for Apple Germany who had 
said the processor was Intel's.  Intel Corp. ( INTC.O ) separately also denied that it would 
be the supplier of the main chip inside Apple's iPhone, but 
said it is supplying chips for the Apple TV.  "We are not providing the silicon inside the iPhone," Intel 
spokesman Bill Kirkus told Reuters. "We are providing the 
silicon inside the Apple TV."
