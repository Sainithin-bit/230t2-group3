 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The U.S. trade deficit narrowed 
unexpectedly in November to its lowest level since July 2005, 
as a weak dollar and strong economic growth abroad helped push 
exports to a record, a Commerce Department report on Wednesday 
showed. 

  The trade gap shrank 1 percent to $58.2 billion, surprising 
analysts surveyed before the report who had made a median 
forecast of $59.9 billion. A drop in oil prices and oil imports 
also trimmed the monthly trade shortfall.  Despite the slight narrowing, the trade gap through the end 
of November totaled $701.6 billion, keeping it on track to set 
a new annual record for 2006.  The closely watched trade deficit with China totaled $213.5 
billion through November, shattering the 2005 annual record of 
$201.6 billion and keeping it on pace to finish 2006 in the 
range of $230 to $240 billion.  U.S. exports of goods and services grew nearly 1 percent in 
November to a record $124.8 billion. Goods and services exports 
also set records in their individual categories, as did capital 
goods and consumer goods.  The strong export performance and narrower trade gap could 
prompt analysts to raise their estimates of fourth-quarter 2006 
U.S. economic growth.  The average price for imported oil fell for the third 
consecutive month in November to $52.25 -- the lowest level 
since January 2006 -- as mild U.S. temperatures helped trim 
demand. Total petroleum imports at $21.5 billion in November 
were the lowest since July 2005, the Commerce Department said.  U.S. imports of consumer products ahead of the Christmas 
holiday hit a record.  Imports from China slipped 5.2 percent in November to $27.8 
billion, but still totaled $236.6 billion for the first 11 
months of the year. The monthly trade gap with China narrowed 
nearly 6.0 percent to $22.9 billion.
