 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Online auctioneer eBay Inc. 
( EBAY.O ) could reveal as early as Thursday its plans to buy 
sports ticket reseller StubHub for more than $300 million, 
people familiar with the deal said on Wednesday. 

  One source with knowledge of the talks said a cash deal had 
been agreed to by San Jose, California-based eBay. The 
agreement calls for eBay to acquire San Francisco-based StubHub 
at a value in the "low $300 million" range and could be 
announced on Thursday.  StubHub, which had more than $400 million in gross ticket 
sales in 2006, has emerged as the leading independent player in 
the online resale market for sports tickets. Fans using the 
service can avoid the perils of scalping unused tickets.  Officials of the two companies declined to comment.  "We have no comment on that," said Jeff Fluhr, co-founder 
and chief executive of StubHub. "There are rumors all the time. 
There were rumors on this four months ago."  An eBay spokesman also declined to comment.  One source cautioned that any deal could still come undone. 
In 2002 eBay had come close to acquiring StubHub for $20 
million but that the tentative agreement had fallen apart over 
price, a separate source said.  Shares of eBay were off 39 cents, or 1.31 percent, to 
$29.36 in late Nasdaq trading on Wednesday.  EBay is StubHub's biggest competitor. Other major rivals 
include IAC/InterActiveCorp's ( IACI.O ) Ticketmaster, 
Craigslist, along with gray-market stadium scalpers.  Sellers send tickets via overnight delivery to buyers and 
StubHub acts as middleman to ensure the privacy of buyers. 
StubHub offers a secure way to connect buyers and sellers of 
tickets, with a money-back guarantee to insure that buyers are 
not cheated out of tickets.  StubHub boasts resale relationships with 30 big name 
professional and college sports teams, Fluhr said in an 
interview last month. It has begun to expand into the resale 
market for music concerts, theater tickets and other events.  The U.S. secondary ticket market has a turnover around $10 
billion a year. This is in addition to the $25 billion primary 
ticket market not just for sports, but for music and other 
entertainment, Fluhr said.  The company has received an undisclosed amount of funding 
since it first raised $2.1 million in 2001.  Investors include Allen & Co., Frank Biondi, Sandy 
Robertson of Francisco Partners and Steve Young, the 
ex-quarterback of the San Francisco 49ers. It raised its last 
round of financing in 2005, according to Fluhr.
