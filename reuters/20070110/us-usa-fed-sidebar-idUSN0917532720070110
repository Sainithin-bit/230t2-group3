 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Falling oil prices won't be enough to satisfy Federal Reserve officials that core inflation is receding as far and as fast as they want -- it will take more slack in job markets to provide that relief. 

 Just as the Fed emphasized in the first half of 2006 that rising energy costs would not heavily affect core inflation, a tumble in oil prices -- which neared 19-month lows on Wednesday -- will not provide policy-makers any peace of mind that inflation pressures are now contained, analysts said. "They have strongly indicated they monitor underlying inflation -- core inflation -- and they dismiss the short-term (effects of) oil prices, energy prices, and food prices on inflation," said Stephen Gallagher, chief U.S. economist for investment bank Societe Generale in New York. Core annual inflation, as measured by an index favored by the Fed, moderated to 2.2 percent in November, the lowest level since May, but still above the 1 percent to 2 percent level many Fed officials have identified as their comfort zone. Fed Vice Chairman Donald Kohn acknowledged in a speech on Monday that a drop in energy prices in recent months had helped restrain some prices elsewhere, but cautioned the effect might be temporary. "Futures markets anticipate that prices of crude oil will increase gradually, which suggests that, once the adjustment to the current level plays out, energy prices will no longer work to restrain total and core inflation," he said. U.S. crude oil prices closed at $53.95 a barrel on Wednesday, the lowest since June 13, 2005, in a sell-off sparked by a warm U.S. winter and shifts in investment fund money. As Kohn had on Monday, Chicago Federal Reserve Bank President Michael Moskow said on Wednesday a tight labor market still posed a risk of wage-related price pressures. "My predominant concern remains the risks to the inflation outlook," Moskow said. The U.S. unemployment rate held steady at 4.5 percent in December, just off a 5-1/2-year low hit in October, while wages picked up, providing little comfort to Fed officials. Kohn expressed concern that the Fed's forecast of gradually easing inflation might go awry if worker productivity were to fail to keep pace with rising labor costs or if businesses started to raise prices to keep up with wage gains. In the meantime, Kohn pronounced it too early for the Fed to relax its concerns about whether the pickup in inflation last spring and summer is pulling back quickly and substantially enough. "What he's basically saying is, the decline in energy prices doesn't automatically mean we're going to cut interest rates," said Steve Ricchiuto, chief U.S. economist for ABN Amro. The Fed has held benchmark interest rates steady at 5.25 percent since June and has remained focused on inflation risks, although it nodded to "mixed" signals on economic growth and the "substantial" housing slowdown at its December 12 meeting. The comments from Kohn and Moskow, who joins the voters on the Fed's policy committee this year, underscored that lower energy costs, while favorable, will not distract the Fed from its focus on tight labor markets. "What he talked about ... was the whole idea that the core is really what's more important, that there are other issues going on in the core relating to tight resource utilization, tight unemployment rates, rising compensation costs that could continue to put upward pressures" on prices, Ricchiuto said, referring to Kohn's speech. Fed officials still hope steady but somewhat sluggish growth will ease tight job-market conditions and help pull core inflation lower, but they are still waiting for their forecast to become a reality. "Has the economy created a lot of excess slack? The answer is no," Ricchiuto said.
