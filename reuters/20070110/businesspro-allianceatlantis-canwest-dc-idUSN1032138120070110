 TORONTO  (Reuters) - CanWest Global Communications Corp. 
CGS.TO and a private-equity unit of Goldman Sachs & Co. 
( GS.N ) have entered into a deal to buy Canadian specialty-TV 
group Alliance Atlantis Communications Inc. AACb.TO for C$2.3 
billion ($1.96 billion), the companies said on Wednesday. 

  Goldman Sachs and CanWest, Canada's biggest media company, 
will pay C$53 per share for Alliance Atlantis, which 
co-produces the hit "CSI: Crime Scene Investigation" TV show 
franchise and owns 13 specialty channels.  The deal will give CanWest exposure to some of the most 
sought-after assets in Canadian specialty broadcasting, chief 
executive Leonard Asper told analysts in a conference call.  "Today, suffice it to say, marks a turning point in 
CanWest's evolution," he said.  "By sharing programing across our multiple platforms, we 
see opportunities for ratings growth, which we expect will 
ultimately drive advertising revenue growth."  It also bolsters Winnipeg, Manitoba-based CanWest's 
position in a highly competitive market, Asper said.  As was widely expected, Alliance's specialty channels will 
be combined and managed together with CanWest's Canadian 
television business, with the formal combination expected 
sometime in 2011.  The CanWest-Goldman bid values the specialty-TV assets at 
about C$1.5 billion, which includes transaction costs and 
expected regulatory costs, Asper said.  CanWest at first will pay C$132 million for a 17 percent 
stake in the specialty-TV business of Alliance. Then, in four 
years, CanWest will contribute its Canadian TV operations to 
form the combined company, Asper said.  CanWest also has the option to pay up to C$200 million for 
a proportionally larger stake, he added.  The equity to be held by Goldman and CanWest in the joined 
entity will be determined by the operating profit of the 
combined operation at that time, though Asper said it's 
expected CanWest should control "a little bit more than 50 
percent."  Alliance's stake in CSI will be fully owned by Goldman 
Sachs Capital Partners. As part of the deal, CBS will become 
the international distributor of the CSI franchise.  As well, Alliance's Motion Picture Distribution business 
will be controlled by a Canadian partner of Goldman.  Michael MacMillan, Alliance's executive chairman, said the 
deal "represents great value for our shareholders" during the 
analyst conference call.
  DEAL OVERSHADOWS EARNINGS REPORT  The deal, which is expected to close by the summer of this 
year, took investor focus away from CanWest's first-quarter 
earnings report, which the company delivered earlier on 
Wednesday.  CanWest said profit spiked, helped by a firming ad market 
in the South Pacific and improvements in its Canadian 
television operations.  It said it earned C$66.4 million, or 37 Canadian cents a 
share, for the three months ended November 30, up sharply from 
C$29.9 million, or 17 Canadian cents a share, in the same 
period a year earlier.  Revenue inched higher to C$860.4 million from C$847.8 
million in the same quarter a year earlier.  It said Canadian TV operations, anchored by its Global 
network, showed a "significant improvement" over last year, 
with revenue up 11 percent to C$208 million in the quarter and 
operating profit rising 30 percent to C$38 million, despite a 
very competitive market.  CanWest said a strong Canadian dollar as well as tough ad 
markets in Australia, where it has a majority stake in Network 
TEN television, continued to hurt operations. However, it added 
the trend was improving.  ($1=$1.17 Canadian)
