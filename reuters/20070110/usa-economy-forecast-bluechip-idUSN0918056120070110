 WASHINGTON  Jan 10 (Reuters) - U.S. economic growth will be
subdued over the first half of this year and will expand at a
healthier clip in the second half, but job growth will be
moderate, a survey of top forecasters showed on Wednesday. 

  The consensus forecast of panelists surveyed in the Blue
Chip Economic Indicators newsletter predicted that economic
growth, as measured by real gross domestic product, would
remain subdued in the short-run.  Real GDP is expected to grow by 2.3 percent and 2.5
percent, respectively, in the first and second quarters of this
year. In the third and fourth quarters, real GDP is expected to
expand by a 2.9 percent and 3.0 percent, respectively.  "Over the past month, most of our panelists grew more
optimistic about the pace of real growth in the final quarter
of last year," the newsletter wrote.  The consensus forecast of annualized real GDP growth in the
fourth quarter rose 0.4 of a percentage point from a
month-earlier forecast to 2.3 percent.  While stronger economic growth is expected later in 2007,
the panelists expect job growth to be moderate, with average
monthly nonfarm payroll gains of 111,000 in 2007 compared with
average monthly gains of 153,000 last year.  At the same time, real investment in business equipment and
software is expected to increase 5.5 percent this year, but
median prices for single-family homes will decline.  The odds of a recession are less likely than earlier
thought. The consensus put the chance of a downturn within the
next 12 months at 25.4 percent, down from 27.4 percent a month
ago.  While the forecast of GDP growth for this year has
steadied, inflation is expected to continue to fall.  The consensus forecast for year-over-year changes in the
consumer price index and the GDP price index for 2007 both
shrank by 0.1 percentage point to 2.0 percent and 2.1 percent,
respectively.
