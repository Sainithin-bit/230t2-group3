 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Magazine publisher Meredith Corp. 
( MDP.N ) said on Wednesday it bought two interactive marketing 
agencies, signaling its deepening involvement in marketing in 
addition to its traditional -- and slower-growth -- publishing 
and broadcasting businesses.. 

  Meredith, which publishes magazines Better Homes and 
Gardens and Family Circle, bought online marketing firm Genex 
and Arlington and Virginia-based marketing firm New Media 
Strategies.  It did not disclose financial terms, but said the 
acquisitions will not have a material effect on Meredith's 
financial performance in fiscal 2007.  Los Angeles-based Genex's clients include Honda ( 7267.T ), 
Toyota ( 7203.T ), Citigroup ( C.N ) and KB Home ( KBH.N ). New Media 
Strategies' clients include ABC , Coca-Cola ( KO.N ), AT&T ( T.N ), 
Ford ( F.N ), Sony ( 6758.T ) and Unilever ( ULVR.L ), Meredith said.  The company last April acquired O'Grady Meyers, a 
Los-Angeles based interactive marketing services company with 
experience in the food, packaged goods and health care 
categories.
