 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. employees left their jobs in November at the fastest pace in over 5-1/2 years, a government report showed on Wednesday, suggesting they have more confidence in their ability to find a better one. 

 The so-called quits rate rose to 2.1 percent in November from 1.9 percent in October, the Labor Department said. It was the second straight monthly rise and took the labor-market gauge to its highest level since May 2001. The rise in the quits rate, which represents voluntary departures, comes against a backdrop of a tight labor market. The U.S. jobless rate rose to 4.5 percent in November, just off the near 5-1/2-year low of 4.4 percent hit in October. It held at 4.5 percent in December. In its monthly Job Opening and Labor Turnover report on Wednesday, the Labor Department said the rate of people leaving their jobs rose in the U.S. Northeast, South and West in November, but dropped in the Midwest. The total rate of separations, a wider measure that covers all terminations of employment, also rose for the second straight month in November, edging up to 3.4 percent from 3.3 percent in October, it said. The November hires rate was unchanged at 3.7 percent for the second straight month. Over the 12 months through November, hires averaged 4.9 million per month, while separations averaged 4.5 million per month. For the comparable year-earlier period, hires averaged 4.8 million per month, while separations averaged 4.6 million. The November job openings rate was 3.0 percent, unchanged for the third consecutive month. The monthly survey lags many job market gauges, but it can provide additional insight on labor market dynamics.
