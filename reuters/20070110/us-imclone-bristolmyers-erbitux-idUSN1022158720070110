 NEW YORK/FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - ImClone Systems Inc. said on Wednesday its Erbitux drug helped stave off colon cancer in patients who had not received other treatments, boosting the drug's potential market and ImClone shares. 

 The biotechnology company, whose shares rose 4 percent, said the drug delayed progression of the disease in patients who took it in combination with chemotherapy as a first line of treatment. Erbitux is already approved to treat colon cancer, but only in patients who have failed other therapies. New York-based ImClone did not disclose data from the trial, which could be used to support earlier use of the medicine. The data will likely be presented this summer at a major medical meeting, it said. "Clearly, this is an important development for ImClone: They needed this study to work," said Oppenheimer & Co. analyst Cory Kasimov. "The questions, however, don't end with this one success," he said, noting stiff ongoing competition with Amgen Inc.'s recently approved Vectibix. Cowen & Co. analyst Eric Schmidt said he was doubtful the results would dramatically boost sales of Erbitux because it has major disadvantages to Genentech Inc.'s Avastin, which is already approved as a first-line treatment for colon cancer. "The burden of proof is now on ImClone and its partners to show that Erbitux is better than Avastin, and I haven't seen any data that make me believe it will be," Schmidt said. Avastin has proven able not only to stave off progression of colon cancer, but significantly prolong lives of patients, something Schmidt said Erbitux has not yet demonstrated. Moreover, he said Avastin costs less than half as Erbitux, requires less frequent dosing and is not associated with often-painful rashes seen with Erbitux and Vectibix, which was launched in October for colon cancer patients whose tumors have spread despite chemotherapy. But Bank of America analyst David Witzke said the new Erbitux study -- conducted by Merck KGaA of Germany, ImClone's partner outside the United States -- could drive first-line use of Erbitux among the 30 percent of patients that do not receive Avastin. "(Even if) ... Erbitux captures only one-third of these patients, this still represents a $300 million incremental annual sales opportunity," Witzke said in a research note. Erbitux, which is ImClone's only product, is sold in the United States in partnership with Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.. The drug, which is also approved to treat head and neck cancer, blocks a protein called epidermal growth factor and is given by infusion. Erbitux provided Bristol-Myers $175 million of third-quarter revenue, from which ImClone received a 39 percent royalty. Last October, billionaire investor Carl Icahn gained control of ImClone after a bitter fight with the company's board, vowing to maximize the value of Erbitux. ImClone achieved notoriety in 2003 when its founder, Samuel Waksal, received a prison term for securities fraud in a scandal that later drew in lifestyle guru Martha Stewart. ImClone shares, which had risen as much as 8.3 percent earlier on Wednesday, edged up $1.50 to $30.72 in afternoon trade on Nasdaq. Bristol-Myers was little changed on the New York Stock Exchange. Shares of Genentech Inc. slipped 62 cents to $84.07, also on the NYSE, while those of Switzerland-based Roche Holding, the majority owner of Genentech, closed slightly lower. Shares of Germany's Merck rose as much as 4.4 percent to $44.05, before eking out a 0.27 percent gain.
