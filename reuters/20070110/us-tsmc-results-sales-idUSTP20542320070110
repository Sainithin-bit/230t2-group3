 TAIPEI  (Reuters) - TSMC ( 2330.TW ), the world's top contract chip maker, undershot its sales forecast for December with an 18.4 percent fall on weak demand, but a recovery looms as a new crop of electronics devices hits store shelves. 

 The fall, more than twice as sharp as the sales drop reported by rival UMC on Tuesday, was part of an industry downturn that began in mid-2006, as softer demand for computers and some consumer gadgets left TSMC's customers with unwanted stocks of chips. Analysts hope the downtrend should end early this year, as Microsoft's new Vista operating system comes on the market to drive demand for PCs. New consumer gadgets, including cellphones and game consoles, will also help stimulate demand for chips. "I am not worried much about the PC sector now because the inventory digestion is nearly over and the handset sector is playing catchup," said JPMorgan semiconductor analyst Roland Shu. Microsoft Corp. ( MSFT.O ) is set to introduce Vista later this month. New systems usually trigger fresh demand for computers -- and the chips that go with them. "If demand really comes back, growth should be steady this year," said Shu, who rates TSMC a "buy" based on a price-to-book ratio of 3.6 times. Unconsolidated sales at Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. (TSMC) came to T$22.376 billion ($690 million) last month, down from T$27.416 billion in the same month a year earlier, the company said, without giving an explanation. The figure was also lower than November's T$24.709 billion, while the fall was sharper than the 7.2 percent year-on-year slippage reported on Tuesday by TSMC's smaller competitor, United Microelectronics Corp. (UMC) ( 2303.TW ) ( UMC.N ). FORECAST MISSED TSMC's fourth-quarter sales totaled T$73.935 billion, according to Reuters calculations, short of its own forecast of between T$74 billion and T$76 billion made in October. TSMC and UMC together account for about two-thirds of global market share, counting the world's top cellphone chip supplier Texas Instruments Inc. TXN.N as one of major clients. TSMC and UMC shares fell more than 2 percent on Wednesday, more than the broader market, after UMC's weak sales report was released late on Tuesday. TSMC's announcement came as the Taipei stock market closed. Before the day's pullback, TSMC and UMC had risen 23 percent and 14 percent respectively from a trough in mid-July last year. TSMC has been driving process technology to advanced 90-, 65- and 45-nanometre as next-generation electronics devices such as cellphones and game consoles require more powerful processors. A recent government revision that allows local chip makers, including TSMC, to make chips using 0.18-micron technology, which is several generations behind the state-of-the-art, in China could also help the company win more orders in the future.
