 CARACAS  (Reuters) - Venezuela on Wednesday ruled out using 
confiscation to nationalize the country's largest 
telecommunications firm CANTV TDVd.CRVNT.N and said it 
could compensate shareholders for the planned take-over. 

  Finance Minister Rodrigo Cabezas told Reuters that Caracas 
was still studying how to go about nationalizing major 
utilities following President Hugo Chavez's announcement of the 
move on Monday, which roiled financial markets.  "The nationalization process will be carried out in 
accordance with the legal and constitutional framework, that, 
among other things, forbids expropriations," he said in an 
interview.  CANTV's American Depository Shares were up 22 percent at 
1:28 p.m. EST (1838 GMT).  Chavez has promised to nationalize CANTV and leading power 
companies as part of what he calls his socialist revolution.  He is also broadening his control of the giant hydrocarbons 
industry which is the fourth-biggest crude exporter to the 
United States.
