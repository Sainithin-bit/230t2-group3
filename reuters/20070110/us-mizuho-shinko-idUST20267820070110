 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japan's Mizuho Financial Group ( 8411.T ) said it will combine two of its group brokerages next year, creating the country's third-biggest securities house by revenue and the largest controlled by a Japanese bank. 

 Mizuho Securities Co. and Shinko Securities Co. 8606.T will merge in January 2008. The new entity will supplant Nikko Cordial Corp. 8603.T in the sector's income ranking and spearhead an expansion of Mizuho's investment banking business abroad, Mizuho said. "Our goal is eventually to compete on an even footing with Wall Street banks," Mizuho Securities Vice Chairman Keisuke Yokoo, who will become president of the new firm, told a news conference. "If more mergers and acquisitions are needed to achieve that goal we'll consider it." The Mizuho group, Japan's second-biggest financial conglomerate, owns a controlling 81.5 percent stake in Mizuho Securities and a minority stake in Shinko. By combining the brokerages' strengths -- Mizuho Securities caters to corporate clients and is a force in the bond market while Shinko has a more retail focus -- it hopes to win new underwriting and advisory clients in Japan and abroad. "Mizuho has been more successful than other mega-banks in expanding its investment banking business by drawing on its existing corporate clientele," said Kentaro Kogi, a bank analyst at Macquarie Securities. "The merger will help Mizuho further strengthen its businesses." The combined brokerage, which will take Shinko as the surviving legal entity and keep its stock listing but use the name Mizuho Securities, will be bigger than Japan's current No.4 brokerage and top bank-controlled brokerage, Mitsubishi UFJ Securities 8615.T. In terms of assets under management, the new Mizuho brokerage will place fourth in the sector behind leader Nomura Holdings Inc. ( 8604.T ), Daiwa Securities Group Inc. ( 8601.T ) and Nikko Cordial. A merger ratio will be decided later, Mizuho said. GLOBAL AMBITIONS In a sign of Mizuho's broader ambitions, the bank said it would draw together its corporate lending arm, Mizuho Corporate Bank, and the combined brokerage in a new Global Corporate Group. The group will be responsible for cultivating investment banking clients and developing financial products for domestic and international markets, Mizuho said. Mizuho Financial listed its shares on the New York Stock Exchange late last year and has received permission to set up a U.S. financial holding company, a step that allow it to expand from lending into securities and other businesses there. At home, meanwhile, Mizuho is considering whether to increase its 4.9 percent stake in Nikko Cordial to help that brokerage through a cash crunch caused by an accounting scandal, separate sources told Reuters on Tuesday. Shares in Shinko closed up 9.4 percent at 510 yen against a 1.71 percent fall in the benchmark Nikkei  .N225 , while Mizuho Financial's shares slipped 0.9 percent. Regulators must approve the merger, but an official at the Financial Services Agency said the agency welcomed the union. "The key point is that the brokerage would remain listed and so would take direction not only from Mizuho Financial Group but also from the market," said the official, who not to be named. Mizuho Financial will retain a stake of between 50 percent and two thirds through Mizuho Corporate Bank, which holds the group's stake in Mizuho Securities and the bulk of its stake in Shinko, said Shinko President Takashi Kusama, who will become chairman of the merged brokerage. Mizuho's diverse stable of brokerages -- it also owns Mizuho Investors Securities Co. Ltd., a smaller retail brokerage which it said will remain independent for now -- is a legacy of its creation in 2000 in a merger of three big but financially weak banks. Mizuho posted Japan's biggest-ever corporate loss in 2003 -- a hefty $20 billion -- in the culmination of a decade-long bad-loan crisis that crippled its business and forced it to sell most of its overseas assets. It has since recovered, however, and reported a group net profit of 649.9 billion yen ($5.45 billion) in the business year ended March 31, 2006. For the current year, it forecasts a net profit of 720 billion yen. Mizuho Securities is perhaps best known among foreign investors for a massive trading blunder in December 2005 in which a trader's mis-keyed stock order cost the brokerage more than $340 million.
