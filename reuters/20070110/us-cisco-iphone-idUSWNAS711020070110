 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Cisco Systems said on Wednesday it sued Apple Inc. for infringing its "iPhone" trademark, after Apple unveiled a multimedia phone of the same name. 

 Cisco said it was seeking an injunctive relief to prevent Apple from copying its iPhone trademark. Linksys, a division of Cisco, has launched several wireless products with the iPhone name. On Tuesday, a Cisco spokeswoman had said the two companies had been in discussions, and that it believed that Apple would agree to a final document and public statement concerning the trademark.
