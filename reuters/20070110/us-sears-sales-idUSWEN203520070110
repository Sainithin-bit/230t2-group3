 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Sears Holdings Corp. ( SHLD.O ) on Wednesday forecast a jump in fourth-quarter earnings after property sales helped the retailer offset a lackluster holiday season at its Sears and Kmart stores. 

 Sears, led by hedge fund manager Edward Lampert, also said its fourth-quarter forecast includes losses related to derivative transactions, known as total return swap investing. That is a vast shift from the third quarter, when Sears gained $101 million from the investments. The losses are a "fresh indication that derivatives investing will not repeatedly provide the $100+ million gains," that they did in the third-quarter, wrote Credit Suisse analyst Gary Balter in a research note. Sears said it expects net income of $750 million to $830 million, or $4.87 to $5.39 per share, for the fourth quarter ending February 3, compared with $648 million, or $4.03 a share, a year ago. The forecast for the fourth-quarter, which has 14 weeks compared with 13 a year ago, includes a gain of about $20 million pretax from property sales and losses for its swaps. SCANT DETAILS ON SWAPS Sears did not give details on the properties it sold or how it lost money on the swaps. It has said the derivative deals involved substantial risks and returns could vary significantly from quarter to quarter. The Hoffman Estates, Illinois-based retailer expects to end the fiscal year with about $3.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents, excluding Sears Canada, up from the $2.1 billion in cash it reported in November. Investors watch the retailer's cash position closely because the company has given Lampert authority to invest excess money as he sees fit. That has prompted speculation that he intends to buy stakes in other retailers. Balter said the cash position was higher than he expected and "points to a likely external investment next year as no stock was repurchased in the quarter." SEARS, KMART STILL STRUGGLE While the company gave a strong fourth-quarter outlook, it continues to struggle with sales at its Sears and Kmart stores. Sears reported on Wednesday that sales its U.S. Sears stores open at least a year fell 5.6 percent in the nine weeks ended December 30, which included the key holiday shopping season, due to lower sales of lawn and garden products and appliances. It said the decline was partially offset by an improvement in women's apparel sales. Sales at stores open at least a year at its Kmart chain fell 1.2 percent over the same period due to lower transaction volumes, although apparel sales rose. Under Lampert, Sears has reported declining sales but hefty profit growth, thanks in part to cost-cutting. He has said that conventional retail measures like same-store sales have limited value because they do not reflect how much retailers spend on items such as markdowns to drive sales, or whether stores are profitable. Sears shares were up $3.93 to $170.16 in afternoon Nasdaq trading.
