 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Delta Air Lines Inc. DALRQ.PK and 
Northwest Airlines Corp. NWACQ.PK are in talks on a possible 
merger, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday. 

  The newspaper said representatives of the two carriers, 
which are No. 3 and No. 5 in the United States respectively, 
have met regularly for weeks discussing a possible link-up 
after they both emerge from bankruptcy.  The two airlines have been restructuring in bankruptcy 
since September 2005. A Northwest spokesman declined to 
comment. Delta officials were not immediately available for 
comment.
