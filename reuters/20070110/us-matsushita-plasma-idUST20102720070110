 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. Ltd. ( 6752.T ) will spend about 280 billion yen ($2.4 billion) to build the world's largest plasma display factory in western Japan, a source close to the matter on Wednesday. 

 Matsushita, the world's largest maker of plasma display televisions, will begin construction of the factory as early as this year, and the plant is expected to have an annual output capacity of around 10 million units, the source said. The maker of Panasonic products will announce plans for the factory at a news conference after the market close on Wednesday. Shares in Matsushita fell 2.7 percent to 2,310 yen by 0106 GMT, underperforming a 1.2 percent decline in the benchmark Nikkei average  .N225 . Matsushita spokesman Akira Kadota said the company would make an announcement about its investment plans on Wednesday, but he would not comment on specifics about plasma display investments. Global demand for flat TVs has been growing but unit prices have been falling rapidly, pressuring makers to cut production costs to stay competitive. Plasma TVs make up about 18 percent of global flat TV demand, which was estimated at 54.27 million units in 2006, the Nikkei business daily said, citing DisplaySearch data. The U.S. research firm said earlier this month that plasma display panel revenue was expected to be flat in 2007 at $7.7 billion because of sharp price declines. Matsushita currently has four plasma display factories in operation with a fifth due to come on line this summer, boosting its overall annual production capacity to the equivalent of 11.5 million 42-inch panels. It will likely close two older factories in Osaka as the new factory in Hyogo comes on line, eliminating about 3 million units of capacity. With the new factory, its overall capacity should come to about 18 million units a year, the Nikkei said. The paper said production at the new plant will likely begin in summer of 2008. Matsushita's competitors in the plasma TV market include Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd. ( 005930.KS ), LG Electronics Inc. ( 066570.KS ), and Pioneer Corp. ( 6773.T ). Matsushita said in October it expected to sell about 3.7 million plasma TVs in the year to March 2007, down from its original target of 4 million, because the sales mix was likely to include a greater proportion of larger sets.
