 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Tiffany & Co. ( TIF.N ) said on Wednesday that sales during the holiday shopping season rose a better-than-expected 7 percent at stores open at least a year and the company nudged its full-year earnings outlook higher. 

 But the shares of the high-end jeweler fell 2.4 percent in afternoon trading, with one analyst saying its forecast may not have measured up to investors' expectations. "With the strong sales in the New York market and outside, people thought the (earnings) range would be even higher," said Oppenheimer & Co Inc. analyst Christopher Jones, who has a "neutral" rating on the company's shares. The company estimated net earnings for the fiscal year ending January 31 at $1.82 to $1.85 per share, up from its previous forecast of $1.79 to $1.84. The revised forecast is in line with analysts' expectation of $1.83 a share, according to Reuters Estimates. The company also expected an increase of 14 percent to 15 percent in fourth-quarter sales and earnings of $1.03 to $1.06 per share, helped by increased sales of diamonds and silver jewelry. New York-based Tiffany said total sales for the period from November 1 through December 31 rose 15 percent to $818.1 million and that strong sales in the United States and other international markets offset its lackluster performance in Japan. Japan currently accounts for half of Tiffany's total international sales. The company has been selling its jewelry through its own boutiques in Mitsukoshi's stores, Japan's oldest department store chain, since 1972. According to a regulatory filing, the contract between the companies expires on January 31 and renewal talks are in way. Tiffany spokesman Mark Aaron said although Mitsukoshi has not indicated it will close Tiffany stores, the jeweler is "discussing the potential to perhaps close a few underperforming locations" when it renews the contract. That would drag down Tiffany's square footage growth and hurt sales more, Oppenheimer's Jones said. But Tiffany's plan to open five to seven stores in the United States and 10 stores internationally in 2007 would help marginalize the impact of weak sales in Japan, Jones added. In the United States, holiday retail sales rose 12 percent to $432.4 million. Sales at U.S. stores open at least a year, an important measure known as same-store sales, were up 8 percent, with increases of 15 percent at the flagship New York store and 7 percent at branches. Tiffany said the number of transactions and the average amount spent per transaction both rose in the holiday season. Tiffany forecast a double-digit net sales increase for the coming fiscal year, while analysts were expecting an 8.5 percent rise, according to Reuters Estimates. Tiffany also expected a 13 percent to 15 percent increase in earnings per share for the coming fiscal year, compared with analysts' forecasts of $2.07 per share, up 13 percent from their average outlook for this year. Last week, lower-priced jeweler Zale Corp. ( ZLC.N ) reported a 2.3 percent increase in its same-store sales for the holiday shopping period, but cut its profit forecast for the current quarter. Tiffany shares were down 94 cents, or 2.4 percent, at $38.68 in midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
