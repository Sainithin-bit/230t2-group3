 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - U.S. airline shares rocketed higher on Monday as the price of oil, which is directly linked to the price of jet fuel, fell to its lowest price in more than three months. 

 Shares in United Airlines parent UAL Corp UAUA.O posted the largest percentage gain -- 18 percent -- before falling back to 11.7 percent higher at $12.43 in afternoon trading on Nasdaq. US Airways Group ( LCC.N ) was up 14 percent at $9.07 on the New York Stock Exchange. AMR Corp AMR.N, parent of American Airlines, was up 11.2 percent at $12.52 on NYSE. The Amex airline index  .XAL  gained almost 7 percent. Airline shares are still down sharply for the year after record high fuel prices pummeled the industry and triggered announcements of sweeping capacity and job cuts. The Amex airline index was down about 20 percent since the beginning of 2008. (Reporting by Kyle Peterson; Editing by  Brian Moss )
