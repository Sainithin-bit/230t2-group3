 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Engineering and construction company Fluor Corp ( FLR.N ) posted a second-quarter profit that beat expectations, boosted by an asset sale and strong demand from the energy sector, and it raised its full-year profit forecast. 

 Net earnings rose to $209 million, or $1.13 per share, from $96 million, or 53 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter. Operating profit more than doubled to $392 million, while revenues rose 37 percent $5.77 billion. Excluding the $79 million pre-tax gain from the sale of its stake in Britain's Greater Gabbard Offshore Windfarm, Fluor earned 87 cents per share, topping the 80 cents per share that analysts had forecast, according to Reuters Estimates. The company lifted its full-year forecast to a range of $3.65 to $3.80 per share from its previous expectation of $3.30 to $3.45 per share. Fluor's oil and gas business posted a 68 percent jump in operating profit to $169 million, while its power segment posted a four-fold increase to $25 million. Shares of Fluor jumped on the news to $80, up $4.00 or about 5 percent in extended trade, after closing at $76.18 on the New York Stock Exchange.
