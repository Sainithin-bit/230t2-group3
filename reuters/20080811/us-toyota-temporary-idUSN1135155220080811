 TRAVERSE CITY, Michigan  (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp is considering exporting U.S.-made vehicles as it sees potential demand for its large pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles overseas, the automaker's U.S. manufacturing chief said on Monday. 

 Toyota could also cut more temporary U.S. manufacturing jobs if the downturn in the U.S. auto industry deepens, as it has cut U.S. truck production amid a collapse in demand for the once-popular, gasoline-thirsty vehicles, the executive said. Toyota, now No. 2 in U.S. sales behind General Motors Corp, is facing the unprecedented problem of excess capacity in the U.S. market as demand for large vehicles such as its Tundra pickup trucks and Sequoia SUVs has tumbled in the wake of record gasoline prices. The automaker is also contending with a strong yen, which eats into profits earned abroad when foreign currencies are converted into the Japanese currency. Steve St. Angelo, senior vice president of Toyota Motor Engineering and Manufacturing in North America, said the automaker is evaluating the idea of exporting the Tundra pickup and the Sequoia SUV, now exclusively built in the U.S. market. Better-selling cars such as the Camry and the Corolla are not part of that consideration because Toyota "cannot build the cars any faster than right now in the United States," a Toyota spokesman said later. Toyota has already cut about 500 temporary jobs this year and sees a possibility of additional reductions depending on a "fluctuation in the market," St. Angelo told Reuters on the sidelines of an industry forum in Traverse City. Temporary workers account for 10 percent of Toyota's 30,000-member U.S. manufacturing work force. St. Angelo said Toyota is considering measures to minimize the work force reductions, such as relocation of workers at plants producing larger vehicles to its Georgetown, Kentucky, plant, which builds better-selling, better-mileage cars such as the Camry, Avalon and Solara. Toyota's U.S. sales fell 7.6 percent year-to-date through the end of July, with a 15 percent drop in truck sales. Hit by a demand meltdown for pickup trucks and large SUVs, Toyota cut its U.S. sales forecast for 2008 to 2.44 million vehicles from 2.64 million. The new projection would represent a 7 percent fall from 2007. The deeper-than-expected downturn in U.S. industrywide sales has already forced automakers including GM, Ford Motor Co and Nissan Motor Co Ltd to reduce truck production and lay off thousands of factory workers. To respond to fast-chancing consumer needs, Toyota last month announced a major overhaul of its U.S. manufacturing plans to shift to more fuel-efficient cars. It now plans to build its Prius hybrid, instead of the Highlander SUV, from 2010 at a factory under construction in Mississippi. Toyota also suspended production of slow-selling big trucks -- Tundra pickups and Sequoia SUVs in the United States -- for three months starting Friday. Toyota is still looking to resume truck production in early November, but it is hard to predict the exact timing due to volatile gasoline prices, which have prompted a consumer defection from trucks and SUVs, St. Angelo said.
