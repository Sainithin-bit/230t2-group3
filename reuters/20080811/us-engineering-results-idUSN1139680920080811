 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The global boom in spending by oil producers and power generators pumped up profits at engineering and construction groups Fluor Corp ( FLR.N ) and McDermott International Inc ( MDR.N ). 

 Soaring oil prices, which reached a record near $147 per barrel last month before pulling back, and growing international demand for electricity have triggered a wave of new energy development projects, boosting the bottom line for companies that build the large projects. "We are encouraged by the strength of our financial results to date, and see substantial opportunity for the balance of the year," Fluor Chief Financial Officer Mike Steuert said in a statement on Monday. Irving, Texas-based Fluor raised its full-year forecast and easily beat analysts' expectations for second-quarter profits, sending its shares up more than 5 percent in after-market trade. But McDermott's 26 percent rise in revenue to $1.79 billion lagged analysts' forecast of $1.85 billion, sending its shares down about 5 percent in after-hours trading. Fluor's net earnings climbed to $209 million, or $1.13 per share, from $96 million, or 53 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter, helped by a $79 million pretax gain from the sale of its stake in Britain's Greater Gabbard Offshore Windfarm. Excluding that gain, Fluor's earnings of 87 cents per share beat the analysts' consensus forecast of 80 cents per share. Houston-based McDermott said its net income rose to $177.5 million, or 77 cents per share, from $149.4 million, or 66 cents per share, a year earlier. BRIGHT FUTURE Bolstered by the energy sector demand, Fluor lifted its full-year forecast to a range of $3.65 to $3.80 per share from its previous expectation of $3.30 to $3.45 per share. Fluor's oil and gas business posted a 68 percent jump in operating profit to $169 million, while its power segment posted a four-fold increase to $25 million. McDermott's offshore oil and gas construction arm saw earnings rise a more modest 8 percent to $98 million as a slowdown in the Caspian region pared gains from business in the Middle East and Asia Pacific regions. Still, McDermott's power generation business posted a 41 percent increase in income to $106 million. Shares of Fluor jumped to $80 per share after closing at $76.18 on the New York Stock Exchange, while McDermott shares fell to $39.80 after closing at $41.88.
