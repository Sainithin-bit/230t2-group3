 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures were little changed on Monday as geopolitical concerns fueled caution and oil prices edged higher. 

 And with Wall Street coming off its best week in more than three months, thanks to the recent precipitous drop in oil prices, there was also likely to be some profit-taking. Keeping investors on edge was the continued fighting in the Caucasus where simmering conflict between Russia and its small former Soviet neighbor, Georgia, has erupted into open conflict that has alarmed Western governments.  "This could be an excuse for oil to go up," said Matt McCall, president of Denver, Colorado-based Penn Financial Group. "With oil at three-month lows, in a very oversold condition, it could be due for a pop and that could be one factor that weighs on the market." However, the dollar hit a six-month high against major currencies on Monday, which could slow any rise in oil and help the stock market extend gains, McCall said. S&P 500 futures inched up 1.30 points but were below fair value, a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into account interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the contract. Dow Jones industrial average futures climbed 17 points and Nasdaq 100 futures rose 6.5 points. U.S. front-month crude was up $1.04 at $116.16 a barrel. A report in the Britain's Sunday Telegraph said that UPS was planning a 10 billion euros ($15.2 billion) bid for TNT.  Shares of futures and options broker MF Global Ltd MF.N could be worth $10 in about a year after first-quarter results showed the company was not losing clients and was impressively cutting costs, Barron's newspaper reported. U.S. stocks soared on Friday rounding out their best week in more than three months, as oil plunged below $115 a barrel, easing inflation concerns and improving prospects for business and consumer spending. The slide in oil prices to their lowest level in three months powered the biggest rally in retailing shares in six years, with Home Depot ( HD.N ) gaining 7.7 percent. (Editing by Kenneth Barry)
