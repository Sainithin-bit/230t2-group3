 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Unusual heavy trading in Bear Stearns Cos put options before the collapse and eventual sale of the investment bank to JPMorgan Chase & Co ( JPM.N ) in March has raised questions on whether put buyers were confident its shares would crash, Bloomberg News reported on Monday. 

 The suspected bearish option bets were placed on March 11, the day the Federal Reserve attempted to shore up confidence in credit markets with a lending program, Bloomberg reported, citing data it compiled. On that day, when Bear Stearns shares closed at $62.97 on the New York Stock Exchange, an options trader or a group of traders made a $1.7 million bet that Bear Stearns shares would suffer an unprecedented fall within days, Bloomberg reported. The gambit had such low odds of success that traders question its legitimacy, Bloomberg said. The suspected put options were due to expire nine days later, Bloomberg said. Unusual options trading can offer a clue to security regulators of any market manipulation and insider trading. Whoever placed the bet used put options giving purchasers the right to sell 5.7 million Bear Stearns shares for $30 apiece. Another bearish bet representing the right to sell 165,000 Bear shares for $25 apiece was also initiated, Bloomberg data showed. The 57,000 puts that traded March 11 at the $30 strike price and the 1,649 contracts that traded at the $25 strike price were collectively worth about $1.7 million, Bloomberg said. Each put represents 100 shares of stock. The fact that some option traders had reaped a windfall in these suspected trades of more than $270 million before the investment bank's demise had some option specialists crying foul, Bloomberg reported. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission declined to comment on whether it was examining options trading in the days before Bear Stearns collapsed. But the  SEC, along with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority -- the NYSE regulation and broker-dealer watchdog -- have increased efforts to stop the spread of false rumors, which had been blamed for Bear's demise.
