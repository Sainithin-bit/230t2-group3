 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ) said on Monday it will buy back about $4.5 billion of auction rate securities from clients at their face value, after New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo's office said it wanted to begin settlement talks with the bank and two others. 

 Morgan Stanley also said it would work to provide liquidity in the securities to institutional clients as well. The bank said it would buy back retail auction-rate notes beginning no later than September 30. It also will make whole any clients who sustained losses from selling the securities between February 12 and now. Cuomo's office, earlier on Monday, told JPMorgan Chase & Co ( JPM.N ), Morgan Stanley and Wachovia Corp WB.N that it wants to begin settlement talks immediately. The New York attorney general has been conducting a broader probe of the securities, which were sold to investors as safe equivalents to cash but which have turned out in many cases to be difficult for clients to sell. Morgan Stanley said it has notified Cuomo's office, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, and the Illinois Securities Department of its repurchase plans.
