 HOUSTON  (Reuters) - U.S. engineering and construction company McDermott International Inc ( MDR.N ) said on Monday its second-quarter net income rose 19 percent, helped by higher profits in its offshore oil and gas and power generation businesses. 

 Net income rose to $177.5 million, or 77 cents per share, from $149.4 million, or 66 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter. Revenues rose 26 percent to $1.8 billion. (Reporting by  Anna Driver  in Houston, editing by Richard Chang)
