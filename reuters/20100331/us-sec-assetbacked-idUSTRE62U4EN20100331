 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. securities regulators will meet April 7 to consider new disclosures for asset-backed securities such as those linked to mortgages, the Securities and Exchange Commission said on its web site. 

 The SEC will consider a proposal that would require banks and other issuers to disclose more information about the securities underlying the asset pool. (Reporting by  Rachelle Younglai , editing by Leslie Gevirtz)
