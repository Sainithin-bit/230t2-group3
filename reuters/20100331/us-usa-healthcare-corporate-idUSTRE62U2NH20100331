 (Reuters) - U.S. companies have started to tally the financial hit they say they will take as a result of the U.S. healthcare overhaul signed into law last week by President Barack Obama. 

 The government continues to pay subsidies to large companies, including AT&T Inc ( T.N ), Caterpillar Inc ( CAT.N ) and Deere & Co ( DE.N ), to help pay for prescription drug benefits for their large ranks of retirees. However, the revamped law no longer allows companies to deduct the amount of the subsidies from their taxable income. Corporate America complains that the change amounts to a tax increase, while the White House says it essentially closes a tax loophole. Not all big companies are warning of trouble. General Electric Co ( GE.N ), for example, says it does not expect a "significant material impact" on its first-quarter results. But a number of large U.S. employers have started detailing the expected hit to their bottom line. The latest warning came from No. 2 planemaker Boeing Co ( BA.N ), which on Wednesday said it would take a $150 million charge related to the change. The tally so far: * AT&T said it would record a $1 billion noncash charge for the first quarter and evaluate prospective changes to the healthcare benefits it offers to both active and retired workers. * Deere, a maker of farm equipment, said it expected to record a $150 million charge, mostly in its current fiscal second quarter. The expense was not included in the company's earlier 2010 forecast, which called for net income of about $1.3 billion. * Boeing said it would take an income tax charge of $150 million, or 20 cents per share, against first-quarter results. The impact of the change was not factored into the company's previous forecast. * Caterpillar described the regulatory change as a tax increase. It said accounting standards required the world's largest maker of earth-moving equipment to book a $100 million after-tax charge to reflect the change during the first quarter. * No. 2 life insurer Prudential Financial Inc ( PRU.N ) said it expected a $100 million charge during the first quarter. * 3M Co ( MMM.N ), which makes products ranging from Post-It notes to optical films for flat-panel televisions, will record a one-time, noncash charge of up to $90 million, or 12 cents per share. * Honeywell International Inc ( HON.N ) estimated in January that healthcare reform would trim its first-quarter earnings 4 cents to 5 cents per share. But the diversified manufacturer raised its first-quarter outlook to 45 cents to 49 cents per share from a prior range of 40 cents to 45 cents even after including the one-time charge of $13 million related to the healthcare legislation. * AK Steel Holding Corp ( AKS.N ) will record a noncash charge of about $31 million in the first quarter due to a reduction in the value of its deferred tax asset as a result of a change to the tax treatment of Medicare Part D reimbursements. * Diversified manufacturer ITW said it would take a $22 million charge for the change, lowering its first-quarter earnings per share by 4 cents. * Valero Energy Corp ( VLO.N ) said it expected to take a charge of $15 million to $20 million in the first quarter due to the new healthcare legislation, and it expects more tax costs to be calculated later. * Aircraft parts supplier Goodrich Corp GR.N sees a first-quarter charge of about $10 million, or 8 cents per share. * Metals processor Allegheny Technologies Inc ( ATI.N ) looks for a first-quarter, one-time, noncash charge of about $5 million, or 5 cents per share, due to the new healthcare law.
