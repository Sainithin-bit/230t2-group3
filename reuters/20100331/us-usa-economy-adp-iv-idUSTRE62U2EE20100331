 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. private employers shed 23,000 jobs in March, missing expectations for an increase in jobs, a report by a private employment service said on Wednesday. 

 KEY POINTS: * The February fall was originally reported at 20,000. * The median of estimates from 35 economists surveyed by Reuters for the ADP Employer Services report, jointly developed with Macroeconomic Advisers LLC, was for a rise of 40,000 private-sector jobs this month. COMMENTS: TORSTEN SLOK, SENIOR ECONOMIST, DEUTSCHE BANK SECURITIES, NEW YORK: "It was a surprise. It's a little bit surprising that the economy is continuing to shed jobs here continuing the ongoing improvements we're seeing across economic indicators. "The risk is that this means that the recovery may be coming along slower. Therefore the Treasury market -- meaning rates -- will dip down, at least for the time." DAVID ADER, HEAD OF GOVERNMENT BOND STRATEGY, CRT CAPITAL GROUP, STAMFORD, CONNECTICUT: "Clearly ADP is disappointing to the growth mongerers and challenges the fear of a strong 'clean' report this Friday. And note there is a bias for the March non-farm payrolls report to be weaker--than--expected anyway." JOHN CANALLY, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST AND ECONOMIST, LPL FINANCIAL, BOSTON: "The market had gotten pretty ramped up about a decent payrolls in March and this is curbing the enthusiasm for that number. "The nonfarm payroll has been revised up almost steadily for the last couple weeks and this will certainly stop that and turn that back around. "The only way for equity markets to react ahead of (Friday's payroll report) will be today and tomorrow. This makes the Chicago employment data, the national purchasing manager's data and the initial claims data all that more important. "It throws a little cold water on the idea we were going to be adding jobs in March, which is a little disappointing, people thought finally this might be the month." FRANK CHOLLY SR., SENIOR MARKET STRATEGIST, LIND-WALDOCK, NEW YORK: "Stocks have sold off a bit and the dollar is down. ADP has been hit-and-miss. They have been more cold than hot, but then I'm not sure if I believe in the consensus number for Friday's payrolls which is about 200,000." BORIS SCHLOSSBERG, DIRECTOR FOR CURRENCY RESEARCH, GFT, NEW YORK: "It's a shocker. This is going to have a negative impact on dollar-yen and also impact risk appetite across the board today. Having said that, the ADP report is a notoriously poor predictor for the government's non-farm payrolls. After the initial negative reaction, markets may reserve further judgment on U.S. employment until Friday." PETER KENNY, MANAGING DIRECTOR, KNIGHT EQUITY MARKETS, JERSEY CITY, NEW JERSEY: "Disappointing. The consensus was for something positive, not negative. We got ahead of ourselves. "However, this has been the nature of the move of the market. We've gotten convinced that things are better than they are, and when the numbers don't confirm that, the market thinks that we're still on trend. It's almost like the markets are dragging the data higher. "This number is always looked at as a fairly decent precursor for Friday's number, so for Friday, I think people will be looking for a flat to positive number. A flat number will be positive enough to support where the market has come from."
