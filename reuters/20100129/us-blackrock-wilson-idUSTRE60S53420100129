 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc ( BLK.N ) said on Friday that Kendrick Wilson, a former Treasury Department adviser and veteran investment banker, will join the world's biggest asset manager as vice chairman and member of the chairman's office. 

 Wilson will work with professionals throughout the organization to support client relationships. He will also work closely with the executive management team on organizational and professional development efforts, BlackRock said in a statement. Wilson was tapped by former Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson as an adviser in August 2008, at the height of the financial crisis. Before then, Wilson was vice chairman, investment banking, at Goldman Sachs Group Inc ( GS.N ), where he also served as a member of the executive office and chairman of the financial institutions group. Before joining Goldman in 1998, Wilson was a vice chairman, member of the executive committee and head of investment banking at Lazard Freres & Co ( LAZ.N ). "Ken brings a deep understanding of financial markets and the financial services industry," BlackRock Chairman Laurence Fink said in a statement. "His unique perspective, informed by his vast experience in the industry, will be valuable to our clients as they consider the changing landscape and their investment and risk management strategies."
