 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The New York Federal Reserve said on Friday it bought $989 million of U.S. agency debt with maturities ranging from October 2016 to June 2018. 

 Dealers submitted $3.302 billion of agency debt for consideration in the purchase. Friday's operation brings the N.Y. Fed's cumulative purchase of agency debt to about $164.759 billion since early December 2008. The N.Y. Fed, which conducts open market operations for the U.S. central bank, has said it would buy about $175 billion of agency securities issued by Fannie Mae FNM.N FNM.P, Freddie Mac FRE.N FRE.P and the Federal Home Loan Bank system aiming to hold down mortgage rates and revive economic growth.
