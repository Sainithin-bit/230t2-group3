 (Reuters) - Real estate tycoon Donald Trump is considering whether to either buy or manage Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village housing complex in Manhattan, the New York Post reported. 

 "People have asked us if we would get involved in running it or buying it," Trump told the paper in an interview. "We are looking at it right now very seriously." Tishman Speyer Properties LP and a realty unit of BlackRock Inc ( BLK.N ) are surrendering the 11,200-apartment property four years after their venture bought it from MetLife Inc ( MET.N ). The move followed a default this month on $4.4 billion of debt used to finance the purchase. Boston-based apartment manager WinnCompanies is also looking at the prospect of managing the Stuyvesant Town property, the paper said, citing a person close to the company. Spokespersons for Donald Trump, Tishman Speyer and WinnCompanies were not available to comment. (Reporting by Shailesh Kuber in Bangalore; Editing by Dan Lalor)
