 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Toshiba Corp ( 6502.T ), Japan's biggest chipmaker, kept its outlook below market estimates on rising materials costs and tumbling TV and PC prices after posting a smaller-than-expected operating profit. 

 Toshiba, which owns U.S. nuclear firm Westinghouse, is fighting to clinch nuclear power plant orders, while it tries to expand in lithium-ion batteries and power grids to balance out chip price volatility. Toshiba, the world's No.2 maker of NAND-type flash memory chips after Samsung Electronics Co ( 005930.KS ), kept its annual operating profit outlook at 100 billion yen ($1.1 billion), below a consensus average of 136 billion yen by 21 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Toshiba, which supplies chips to Apple Inc ( AAPL.O ), earned an operating profit of 10.22 billion yen in October-December, up from a loss of 157.68 billion yen a year ago but missing a market consensus of 25.7 billion yen. Its quarterly net loss came to 10.63 billion yen, compared with a 121.1 billion yen loss the previous year on a 6 percent rise in sales. Ahead of the news, its shares fell 2.9 percent, underperforming a 1.9 percent fall in Tokyo's index of electrical machinery stocks .IELEC.T. The stock gained 8.5 percent in the past quarter, outpacing a 3 percent rise in the index. (Reporting by  Mayumi Negishi ; Editing by  Anshuman Daga )
