 BERLIN  (Reuters) - All parties involved in talks on the future of the Airbus A400M military transporter are trying to reach a deal as soon as possible, a spokesman for Germany's defense ministry said on Friday. 

 Discussions between officials from the seven countries whose governments have ordered the plane and Airbus parents EADS ( EAD.PA ) were due to continue in Berlin next week, most likely on February 4, another defense ministry spokesman said. On Thursday, the ministry had said the meeting on Europe's biggest defense project would take place on February 2, but the spokesman said there had been a change in the plans. Airbus had set buyer nations an end-of-January deadline for a deal on the A400M, but an extension to this has been requested, the ministry said. Engine problems and delays have pushed plans for a home-grown European troop and armored vehicle transporter 11.2 billion euros over budget, casting a shadow over 10,000 jobs.
