 PARIS  (Reuters) - Toyota said on Friday it would recall up to 1.8 million vehicles in Europe, as part of a massive safety recall of around 8 million vehicles worldwide because of a problem with accelerator pedals. 

 Toyota Motor Europe said it was not aware of any accidents related to the accelerator pedals, and that only a limited number of incidents had been reported in Europe. On affected vehicles, in rare cases the accelerator pedal could become stuck in a partially depressed position or return slowly to the idle position, the company said. Toyota said there would be no need to stop production in Europe. Below is a list of the models being recalled in Europe, and the production periods affected: AYGO Feb 2005 - Aug 2009 iQ Nov 2008 - Nov 2009 Yaris Nov 2005 - Sep 2009 Auris Oct 2006 - 5 Jan 2010 Corolla Oct 2006 - Dec 2009 Verso Feb 2009 - 5 Jan 2010 Avensis Nov 2008 - Dec 2009 RAV4 Nov 2005 - Nov 2009 (Reporting by Helen Massy-Beresford; Editing by Sharon Lindores)
