 (Reuters) - Hedge fund Paulson & Co has received a request for information from the U.S. securities regulator in connection with an investigation into complex securities at the heart of the financial crisis, the Financial Times said, citing people familiar with the matter. 

 Paulson & Co, the U.S. hedge fund that made billions of dollars by correctly predicting that the housing market would falter, was not a target of any investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the people told the paper. Paulson & Co could not be immediately reached for comment by Reuters. (Reporting by  Sakthi Prasad  in Bangalore; Editing by Mike Miller)
