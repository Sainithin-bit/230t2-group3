 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Verizon Wireless said on Wednesday that in March it would start selling its second Motorola Inc MOT.N phone based on Google Inc's ( GOOG.O ) Android software. 

 The phone, branded Devour, follows strong fourth-quarter sales of Motorola's Droid phone, which helped Verizon Wireless, a venture of Verizon Communications ( VZ.N ) and Vodafone Group Plc ( VOD.L ), regain some market share lost to AT&T Inc ( T.N ). Motorola is depending entirely on phones based on Google's Android for its efforts to revamp its cellphone business after years of losing ground to rivals such as Nokia ( NOK1V.HE ), Apple Inc ( AAPL.O ) and Research In Motion RIM.TO. The device will be the first at Verizon Wireless, the No. 1 U.S. mobile service, to use Motorola's Motoblur software and service, which delivers updates from friends using multiple social sites and backs up contacts and messages on servers. The phone has a 3.1 inch touch screen and preloaded Google applications such as Gmail, Google Search and Google navigation. It will be available to customers who sign up for wireless data services as well as a voice plan. Voice plans at Verizon Wireless start at $39.99 a month, and it charges another $29.99 for unlimited data services such as Web surfing and emailing. Motorola shares were up 20 cents, or 3.1 percent, at $6.75 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. (Reporting by  Sinead Carew ; editing by Lisa Von Ahn)
