 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. private employers cut 22,000 jobs in January, less than the 61,000 jobs lost in December, a report by a private employment service said on Wednesday. 

 KEY POINTS: * ADP national employment report shows U.S. employment decreased by 22,000 private sector jobs in January * Reuters consensus forecast for ADP payroll change was for a decrease of 30,000 jobs * US ADP December payroll change revised to -61,000 from -84,000 COMMENTS: STEVE GOLDMAN, MARKET STRATEGIST, WEEDEN & CO, GREENWICH, CONNECTICUT: "Slightly better than expected. Again, we don't know what the government report will be on Friday, but generally we're in line to slightly better than consensus, so for the market, this won't be a game changing report." MARKET REACTION: STOCKS: U.S. stock index futures briefly turn positive BONDS: U.S. Treasury debt prices steady at lower levels DOLLAR: U.S. dollar extends gains versus yen
