 SINGAPORE  (Reuters) - Europe's aerospace giant Airbus said on Wednesday it sees a recovery in global traffic volume in 2010, saying the global economy has already recovered from a recession. 

 "Everybody was talking about recession... but we actually think we are coming out the other side," Airbus sales chief John Leahy told reporters at the Singapore Airshow. A drop in global passenger demand led Airbus, a unit of Aerospace and Defense giant EADS ( EAD.PA ), and rival Boeing ( BA.N ) face their worst annual orders last year in at least 15 years.
