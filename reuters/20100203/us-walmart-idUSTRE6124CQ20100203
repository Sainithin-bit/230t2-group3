 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc ( WMT.N ) is cutting 300 jobs at its headquarters in northwest Arkansas as the retailer looks to cut costs at the start of its new fiscal year. 

 The jobs are mainly being eliminated in its corporate support divisions, like legal, finance, information systems and human resources. In a memo to employees, CEO Mike Duke said in deciding which jobs to cut, managers were asked to look for opportunities to eliminate duplication and reduce costs. Wal-Mart's current fiscal year began on February 1, and in January, the retailer announced a reorganization of its U.S. operations. It also said it would close 10 money-losing Sam's Club stores and cut 12,700 jobs in its warehouse club division. A spokesman said the retailer did not expect to record any charges for the latest round of job cuts. (Reporting by  Nicole Maestri ; editing by Gunna Dickson)
