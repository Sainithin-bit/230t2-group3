 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Staff at Lehman Brothers Holdings LEH.N have more than their jobs to worry about following a freefall in their employer's stock -- they may also fret over their bonus checks, which this year rely more on the lagging stock. 

 The Wall Street investment bank decided earlier this year to pay its employees more stock and less cash in an effort to curb spending and hold on to talent. According to a Lehman memo obtained by Reuters in early July, the move was meant to "underscore ... confidence" the company had in itself. At the time, some investors took that to mean Lehman was less likely to sell itself cheap, pushing the stock to more than $22 a share. But after a landslide of bad news -- including rumors of lost customers and, on Tuesday, concern that a possible investment from Korea Development Bank was no longer on -- the shares were pushed down to $7.79 at the end of trading on Tuesday. That means the stock bonus is worth nearly 63 percent less than it was on July 1, the date of the share grant to employees. "It shows that all the best intentions in the world can come back and bite you in the rear," said a compensation consultant, who asked not to be named. The July bonus was generally equal to 20 percent of employees' 2007 award, and was an advance against future awards, which usually take place at the end of the year. About 30 percent of Lehman Brothers is owned by its employees. (Reporting by  Jonathan Spicer ; Editing by  Bernard Orr )
