 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - McDonald's Corp ( MCD.N ) said global sales at restaurants open at least 13 months rose a stronger-than-expected 8.5 percent in August, helped by growth in Europe and an Olympics advertising blitz. 

 Shares of the world's largest restaurant chain rose 2.2 percent to $63.77 on Tuesday, adding to its year-to-date gain of 6 percent. "Clearly being an Olympic sponsor in China is a good thing," said RBC Capital Markets analyst Larry Miller. "For McDonald's, it was sort of a home run." Miller, who had only expected worldwide same-store sales to rise as much as 5.5 percent in August, said the results were strong across the board. Same-store sales, a key gauge of retail health, rose 4.5 percent in the United States, 11.6 percent in Europe and 10 percent in the Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa division. McDonald's, which has more than 31,000 restaurants in more than 100 countries, has benefited for months from demand overseas even as U.S. economic conditions deteriorate. In July, the company posted an overall same-store sales gain of 8 percent. Strength in Europe, where rival restaurants chains have reported a slowdown, was a surprise in August. "Europe was back on track," said Stifel Nicolaus analyst Steve West. In particular, he said, same-store sales from Germany were positive after a July decline. West raised his estimate of McDonald's earnings per share for the current third quarter by 5 cents, to 99 cents. He expects strong sales to add 3 cents to his prior estimate and currency factors, another 2 cents. NOT IMMUNE McDonald's has been one of the best performing fast-food chains, as it beats peers such as Wendy's International Inc WEN.N and CKE Restaurants' CKR.N Carl's Jr. chain at driving customer traffic and containing commodity costs. In August, McDonald's sales benefited from extended hours as well as an Olympic-themed Southern Style Chicken Sandwich and Biscuit promotion, a "Star Wars" Happy Meal, localized menu items in Europe and iced tea and coffee drinks. Sectorwide, industry analysts have downgraded U.S. restaurant stocks on concerns about continued weakness in the United States, cost pressures, early signs of slowing business in Europe and a stronger U.S. dollar. Despite its strengths, analysts said McDonald's is not immune the risks hobbling the restaurant industry. RBC analyst Miller noted that so far this quarter, the weak dollar has added 10.5 percent to European sales and 8 percent to the Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa division. "It's likely the currency tailwind will become a headwind over the coming months given current exchange rates," Miller said, adding that industry discounting is the highest he has ever seen and the Olympics effect will fade. "We are increasingly concerned that commodity pressure, currency drags and rising unemployment will begin to weigh more significantly on growth" in the fourth quarter and 2009, UBS Investment Research analyst David Palmer said in a note. McDonald's is already considering revisions to its popular Dollar Menu as the higher cost of making its flagship double cheeseburger pinches franchisees -- whose payments to McDonald's represent about two-thirds of company profits. Meanwhile, shares of McDonald's closest rival, Burger King Holdings Inc BKC.N, fell 1.3 percent to $24.40 on lingering cost concerns. But McDonald's latest sales results show that it is still benefiting as customers trade down to fast food from full-service casual dining chains, which include companies like Chili's Grill & Bar owner Brinker International Inc ( EAT.N ) and the Cheesecake Factory Inc ( CAKE.O ) "They are still taking share from casual dining," Stifel Nicolaus analyst West said, "and I think they will continue to do so."
