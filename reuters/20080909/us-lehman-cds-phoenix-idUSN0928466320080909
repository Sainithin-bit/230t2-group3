 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The cost of protecting Lehman Brothers' debt with credit default swaps rose by 125 basis points on Tuesday as concerns that it may be unable to raise needed capital battered its shares. 

 Five-year credit default swaps on Lehman Brothers traded at 450 basis points, or $450,000 a year to protect $10 million of debt, 125 basis points wider than Monday, according to data from Phoenix Partners Group.  (Reporting by  Dena Aubin )
