 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc shares lost more than one-third of their value on Tuesday on uncertainty about the bank's ability to sell its asset management business and raise needed capital.  

 The following are reactions from industry analysts and other market participants: RICHARD BOVE, ANALYST AT LADENBURG THALMANN "Yesterday morning they put out a press release saying there was going to be a change in management in two of the divisions ... they were signaling that they had not cut a deal with the Korean Development Bank or with anyone else. "People simply made the decision that they didn't want to be anywhere near this company because management was no longer in control of what was in the best interest of shareholders. "I think what has to happen is a hostile takeover, the top management has to be kicked out and, if the stock is falling the way it is, I think that will happen. BILL SMITH, CEO OF SMITH ASSET MANAGEMENT IN NY (SOLD ALL  LEHMAN SHARES SEVERAL MONTHS AGO) "They're in a really difficult spot. "If they sell the crown jewels (Neuberger) you are looking at maybe $9 (billion) to $10 billion in new equity ... the problem there is I don't know if that is enough. "The one way that we have been saying they can escape this would be selling the money management business and then immediately sell the brokerage to a big bank that can handle the losses. "These guys are in trouble." WILLIAM LEFKOWITZ, OPTIONS STRATEGIST AT BROKERAGE FIRM  VFINANCE INVESTMENTS "Several opportunities for Lehman seem to be diminishing. Investors are obviously getting concerned about their long-term financial stability and therefore that is leading to a large sell-off in the stock. Lehman puts have become very active." PETER DIXON, UK ECONOMIST AT COMMERZBANK, LONDON "The (U.S.) government's decision to bail out Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac does take a large part of the uncertainty out of the markets, but it also raises the expectations that it will have to step in to support any other banks which get into trouble. Because if it doesn't policy seems to be very inconsistent. "My guess is that the long-term implications will only be known after maybe a couple of months ... Frankly, the whole episode may have taken away the most immediate sources of uncertainty, it is no real course for celebration in terms of the equity markets. I don't think it changes the underlying negative sentiment out there." REBECCA ENGMANN DARST, EQUITY OPTIONS ANALYST AT  INTERACTIVE BROKERS GROUP IN GREENWICH, CONN. "Options traders have needed very little invitation to position very defensively in Lehman Brothers for some time. And it appears that this morning's movement in its credit default protection was just the catalyst needed to push Lehman's option implied volatility hurdling past its mid-July highs. "With shares now at a fresh low, option traders believe 50 percent of its current depressed share price hangs in the balance between now and September 19 options expiration." WILLIAM LARKIN, FIXED INCOME PORTFOLIO MANAGER, CABOT MONEY  MANAGEMENT, SALEM, MASS. "Lehman has a huge chunk of the mortgage-generation part of the business and they are very susceptible to this whole deterioration -- what is going on with Fannie and Freddie sort of highlights their weakness. "It is probably bottom-feeding. We are approaching their 9/18 earnings announcement, and if Fannie and Freddie just got pulled off the table ... what does that mean about Lehman's current portfolios?" TODD LEONE, HEAD OF LISTED TRADING, COWEN & CO, NEW YORK "Lehman's a big part of (the market's slide). Financials are taking a hit because of it. Lehman's been rumored to be in trouble for a while, and people were hoping the Koreans might bail them out, but now they're not sure that's going to happen." NICK KALIVAS, EQUITY MARKET ANALYST AT MF GLOBAL RESEARCH  IN CHICAGO "The market fears that no one will inject capital in the company."
