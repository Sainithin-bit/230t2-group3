 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Package delivery company FedEx Corp ( FDX.N ) said on Tuesday that its fiscal first-quarter earnings will be better than originally forecast, as fuel prices continue to fall off their recent highs, sending its shares up five percent after the closing bell. 

 But the company, considered a reliable gauge of the overall health of U.S. business, left its fiscal year profit forecast unchanged, saying it expects a weaker macroeconomic picture to offset its better-than-expected first-quarter results. It also said that it was reducing its $3 billion capital expenditure plan for the year by $400 million to help control costs. FedEx said the move was necessary because the U.S. slowdown was spreading overseas. The Memphis, Tennessee-based company said it now expects to report a profit of $1.23 a share for the quarter ended August 31, up from its previous forecast of between 80 cents and $1 a share. It said it still expects to report a fiscal 2009 profit of $4.75 to $5.25 a share. Analysts on average expect the company to report a profit of $4.99, according to Reuters Estimates. "First quarter results benefited from lower-than-expected fuel costs late in the quarter and stringent cost management," Alan Graf, the company's chief finance officer, said in a statement. "While sustained declines in fuel prices could improve our full-year outlook, the slowing economic growth trends in the U.S. are now extending to other areas of the global economy. As a result, we have reduced our planned capital investments by $400 million, to $2.6 billion for fiscal 2009." Shares of the company were up 5 percent at $89 in after-market trade, after closing down 11 cents at $84.75 Tuesday in the regular session on the New York Stock Exchange.
