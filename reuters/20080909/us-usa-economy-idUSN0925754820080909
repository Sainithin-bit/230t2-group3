 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Pending sales of existing U.S. homes fell more sharply than expected in July, partially erasing gains from the previous month, data from a real estate trade group showed on Tuesday. 

 Inventories at U.S. wholesalers rose 1.4 percent in July, twice what analysts had forecast, while sales were down 0.3 percent, the Commerce Department reported on Tuesday.
    KEY POINTS:  PENDING HOME SALES:  * The National Association of Realtors Pending Home Sales Index, based on contracts signed in July, was down 3.2 percent to 86.5 from an upwardly revised index of 89.4 in June.  * Economists polled by Reuters ahead of the report were expecting pending home sales to decline by 1.0 percent.  * The association's chief economist, Lawrence Yun, said the index was oscillating monthly but was essentially flat for many months now.  WHOLESALE INVENTORIES:  * Wall Street analysts polled by Reuters were expecting inventories to rise 0.7 percent, compared with a 0.9 percent gain in June, previously reported as 1.1 percent.  * The inventory-to-sales ratio, a measure of how long it would take to sell stocks at the current sales pace, rose to 1.07 months' worth in July from 1.06 months' in June.  COMMENTS: CARLEY GARNER, SENIOR ANALYST, DECARLEY TRADING, LAS VEGAS: "The housing numbers offer no surprises. We all know the housing market is struggling. The Treasury market has priced in the worst." GEORGE DAVIS, CHIEF TECHNICAL ANALYST, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS, TORONTO: "I don't think we will get too much of a move here. Pending home sales were weaker than expected and that may trigger a little bit of profit taking on long dollar positions but given the bullish sentiment that is present right now we will probably see a limited decline in the dollar."  MARKET REACTION:  STOCKS: U.S. equities pare gains after home sales data  BONDS: U.S. Treasury prices little changed after data  DOLLAR: U.S. dollar dips vs. euro after home sales
