 SINGAPORE  (Reuters) - Franklin Templeton Investments has 
appointed an executive to spearhead efforts to improve ties 
with sovereign wealth funds in a bid to manage more of the $2-3 
trillion controlled by these state-owned entities. 

  David E. Smart, previously an executive vice president who 
headed Templeton's Europe, Middle East and Africa institutional 
sales, will become global head of sovereign funds and be 
responsible for managing and expanding the firm's client base.  "Sovereign funds are one of the fastest growing pools of 
assets in the world and could rival the total worldwide pool of 
pension funds in size within five years," Templeton said in a 
statement dated Monday.  The growth "has become a global phenomenon which has 
stimulated the need for a dedicated group focused on the 
specialized needs and requirements of these funds," it added.  Smart, who is based in London, will report to Templeton's 
Executive Vice President of Global Advisory Services Vijay 
Advani.  Templeton Franklin Resources, which is listed on the New 
York Stock Exchange as Franklin Resources ( BEN.N ), manages 
about $570 billion in assets.  (Reporting by  Kevin Lim ; Editing by Louise Heavens)
