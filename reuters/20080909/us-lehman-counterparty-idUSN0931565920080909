 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Banks and investors continue to trade with Lehman Brothers Holdings LEH.N even as concerns over its capital levels mount, though some credit derivative investors have been reducing their exposure to the investment bank, analysts and traders said on Tuesday. 

 Lehman's stock plunged as much as 40 percent and its debt protection costs surged on Tuesday on concern that talks on a possible investment from Korea Development Bank had broken down. Investors are worried that the fourth-largest Wall Street investment bank would be unable to raise needed capital.  Investors have been nervous about Lehman's ability to survive as it struggles to raise capital to offset losses from mortgages. "Lehman is trading very much like Bear Stearns was prior to the bailout," said Tim Backshall, chief analyst at Credit Derivatives Research in Walnut Creek, California. The U.S. Federal Reserve organized a rescue of Bear Stearns in March on concerns its failure could have sparked a systemic meltdown in financial markets, given the size of Bear's role as a counterparty in the credit derivative market. With a large trading book in credit and other derivatives, many expect the Fed would also be unlikely to allow Lehman to fail. "Just like Bear Stearns, Lehman has a lot of relationships and exposures to a lot of other firms," said a credit derivative trader at a competing bank, who declined to be identified. "It would stand to reason that if the Fed and Treasury were worried about Bear Stearns causing contagion, then it would also apply here." In spite of this, some investors have been paring their exposure to the bank, while others are reluctant to increase their exposure. "We are still trading with Lehman ... but we would not be looking to increase our position," said another credit derivative trader who declined to be named. Credit Derivatives Research' Backshall said clients have told him they have been reducing their exposure over recent months as the perception of the company's health deteriorates. In recent weeks some clients have been unwinding credit derivative trades with Lehman at a faster pace, ahead of the introduction of the new series of benchmark credit derivatives indexes scheduled to be introduced later this month, he added. When a new index series is introduced, many investors unwind trades in the older index and replace the trade on the new index, which is typically the most liquid. Instead of setting the new trades with Lehman, clients are in some cases looking for other counterparties, Backshall said. "It is somewhat clear that clients are nervous" to reset the trades with Lehman, he said. "Clients have expressed concerns and see that as a way of reducing counterparty risk."
