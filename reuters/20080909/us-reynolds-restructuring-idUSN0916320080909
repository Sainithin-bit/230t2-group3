 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Tobacco company Reynolds American Inc ( RAI.N ) said on Tuesday it will cut about 570 jobs and change its focus on some cigarette brands, as it tries to boost growth in a declining U.S. cigarette market. 

 The company also said it would refocus its investment in the premium menthol category from its Kool brand to Camel products. The job cuts, which represent about 10 percent of the U.S. employee count for Reynolds and its R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co subsidiary, will generate about $100 million in savings by year-end 2010, and annual savings of about $55 million after that, the company said in a statement. Reynolds, with other brands such as Winston cigarettes and Kodiak and Grizzly smokeless tobacco, expects a pretax charge of about $90 million in the third quarter from the restructuring. The move comes a day after cigarette company Altria Group Inc ( MO.N ) said it would buy UST Inc UST.N for $10.4 billion, giving it a leading position in the growing smokeless tobacco market against Reynolds. Reynolds said it is evaluating the impact of the restructuring on its 2008 results, which it has said earlier will be flat with 2007 earnings. The company also said it is reviewing the value of its Kool trademark, and would add the impact, if any, in third-quarter results. (Reporting by  Aarthi Sivaraman , editing by Dave Zimmerman)
