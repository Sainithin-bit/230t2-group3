 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. consumer confidence improved in 
September to its strongest reading since October 2007, implying 
American's confidence is in recovery mode, according to a 
survey released on Tuesday. 

  Investor's Business Daily and TechnoMetrica Market 
Intelligence said their IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index 
climbed to 45.8 in September from August's 42.8.  "Consumer confidence continues to rebound from the lows of 
June and July, when gasoline prices were thundering beyond $4 
per gallon," Raghavan Mayur, president of TIPP, said in a 
statement.  "The drop in gasoline prices correlates directly with 
improving consumer confidence; even the publication of some 
less-than-stellar unemployment data couldn't put a dent in 
Americans' improving outlook," he added.  The IBD/TIPP surveyed more than 900 adults in the first 
week of September.  (Reporting by  Rodrigo Campos ; Editing by  James Dalgleish )
