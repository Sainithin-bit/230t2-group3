 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The cost of protecting Lehman Brothers' LEH.N debt with credit default swaps rose by 50 percent on Tuesday amid concerns that the investment bank may be unable to raise needed capital. 

 Five-year credit default swaps on Lehman Brothers traded at 490 basis points, or $490,000 a year to protect $10 million of debt -- about 163 basis points wider on the day, according to John Atkins, an analyst at IDEAglobal in New York. Lehman's shares sank nearly 45 percent on Tuesday amid concerns that talks on a possible investment from the Korea Development Bank had broken down.  Lehman's swaps had traded as wide as 520 basis points earlier in the session, according to Phoenix Partners Group. Its swaps, however, are still trading tighter than Bear Stearns' were before Bear's near-collapse in March. Bear's swaps closed at 737 basis points on March 14, when its shares plunged 50 percent, prompting a rescue engineered by the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department. Earlier that day, they had traded at an upfront cost of 11 percent, plus annual premiums of 500 basis points. Swaps trade upfront when concerns grow that a default is more likely. "I think the Bear Stearns precedent has made people expect that any drop in stock price like this essentially means that the game is over," said Atkins. "But I think on this occasion it is not coming quite as much out of left field." Lehman could probably survive as a stand-alone company even with its stock price plunging, Atkins said. "The problem will be of course if other people disagree and the lines of credit start getting pulled very rapidly, and we're not going to know that until it's probably too late," he said.
