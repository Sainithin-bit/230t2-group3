 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Economists put a positive spin on some negative headlines for U.S. housing and wholesale inventory data on Tuesday. 

 The sharp decline in a July pending U.S. home sales report cut into the prior months robust gains, but economists are seeing signs of stabilization building in the housing market. "Through the ups and downs, the data continue to show signs of stabilization in existing home sales, albeit with the help of a boost from distressed sales of foreclosed homes and still-declining prices," UBS wrote clients. At the same time, a surge in wholesale inventories twice the size of what analysts had forecast, while sales fell last month belie a strong contribution to growth from production. In addition, the sharp drop in energy prices over the last two months is seen as the main reason for a rise in one consumer confidence report. But there was some data headlines that could not be explained away. Staffing services company Manpower Inc. said its seasonally adjusted employment outlook fell for the fourth consecutive quarter, reaching the lowest level since 2003 amid signs the U.S. job market slowdown is spreading to economies around the globe. The mixed picture on the economy however was overshadowed by losses in the U.S. stock market after Standard & Poor's said it may cut its credit ratings on Lehman Brothers Holdings, causing financial stocks to fall. Investors fleeing Lehman's shares are indicative of a credit crisis that has yet to finish unraveling even as the federal government takes control of mortgage giants Fannie Mae FNM.N and Freddie Mac.FRE.N. The National Association of Realtors Pending Home Sales Index, based on contracts signed in July, was down 3.2 percent to 86.5 from an upwardly revised index of 89.4 in June. A Reuters poll of economists forecast a 1.0 percent drop. In June the index surged 5.8 percent. "The pending home sales numbers do keep ratcheting up. They advanced through the second quarter and they seem to be holding most of the gains," said Mike Englund, chief economist at Action Economics. "So I don't think this will be perceived by individuals in the housing market as a turn. But I think to economists it is essentially the first step of a turn if we can stabilize the sales market, which has been done over the last nine months," he said. INVENTORIES, SALES, CONFIDENCE Inventories at U.S. wholesalers rose 1.4 percent last month, double what economists polled by Reuters had forecast. At the same time sales dropped 0.3 percent versus a 3 percent rise in June. The inventory-to-sales ratio, a measure of how long it would take to sell inventories at the current sales pace, rose to 1.07 months' worth in July from 1.06 months' in June. "On the one hand it is negative in that firms are building up excess inventories. It is positive for the near-term adding up of GDP growth because it is a sign production is still increasing in the economy," said Zach Pandl, economist at Lehman Brothers in New York. "In the wholesale sector in particular, the inventory to sales ratio is near a record low, suggesting there is still some pent-up demand for stock building even with the slowdown in sales growth," he said. Lehman forecasts inventories will add over 1.5 percentage points to third quarter growth, which it now puts at 2.3 percent quarter-over-quarter an  annualized basis. On the retail level, the International Council of Shopping Centers and UBS Securities reported a 0.1 percent drop in chain store sales in the week ended September 6 versus a 0.1 percent increase in the prior week. Sales were up 1.9 percent however during the latest period versus the same time a year ago. Redbook Research reported a 1.8 percent rise in U.S. chain store sales in the week ended September 6 versus a year ago. "Weekly store sales indexes showed continued slowing in the first week of September, as the boost from tax rebates continues to fade," UBS economists wrote. And finally, the drop in oil prices is having positive impact on consumer confidence as prices at the gas pump drop, the latest Investor's Business Daily and TechnoMetrica Market Intelligence showed. The IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index climbed to 45.8 in September from August's 42.8. This is the strongest reading since October 2007.
