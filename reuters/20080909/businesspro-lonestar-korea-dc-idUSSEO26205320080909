 SEOUL  (Reuters) - Lone Star has submitted documents 
requested by South Korean authorities that could help the 
private equity house avoid sanctions including the forced sale 
of its shares in Korea Exchange Bank (KEB), already offered to 
HSBC. 

  The Financial Services Commission (FSC) said on Tuesday 
that U.S.-based Lone Star LS.UL had submitted requested 
documents related to the regulator's review of whether the 
Dallas-based firm was a qualified top shareholder in a domestic 
bank, a standard procedure for major shareholders in local 
lenders.  The private equity firm holds a 51 percent stake of KEB 
004940.KS, the country's No. 6 bank, for which global banking 
giant HSBC ( HSBA.L ) ( 0005.HK ) has offered $6.3 billion.  "Lone Star delivered its stance that it will help with the 
(FSC's) requests when it submitted the related documents," the 
agency said in a statement.  On September 2, the FSC said it could fine Lone Star for 
failing to submit regulatory documents it said were due at the 
end of August, and that if fined, Lone Star would be ordered to 
sell shares in KEB immediately.  "As regards to the fining matter, the Financial Services 
Commission will get through the procedures as was announced, 
but any decision will be made after consideration of overall 
conditions," the commission said.  Any ruling against Lone Star could prompt HSBC to seek to 
lower the $6.3 billion it offered for the stake in KEB, 
analysts said.  FSC Chairman Jun Kwang-woo said on Monday that the 
government may give the go-ahead to HSBC's offer to buy control 
of KEB in the near future if it finds no faults with documents 
submitted by the companies involved.  (Reporting by Kim Yeon-hee; Editing by  Jonathan Hopfner )
