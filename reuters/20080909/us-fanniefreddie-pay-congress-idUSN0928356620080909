 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Two U.S. Democratic senators on Tuesday called on regulators to revise severance packages for the outgoing chief executives of Fannie Mae FNM.N and Freddie Mac FRE.N, calling them lavish 

 "We find it way out of line," Charles Schumer of New York and Jack Reed of Rhode Island said, questioning the multimillion-dollar packages at a time when U.S. taxpayers dollars may have to foot the bill resulting from any financial losses caused by errors in management. Over the weekend the U.S. Treasury Department seized control of the two government-sponsored entities, which together back about half the country's $12 trillion in mortgages.
