 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Apple Inc Chief Executive Steve Jobs said he was healthy but could stand to gain 10 to 15 pounds, cable news channel CNBC reported on Tuesday. 

 CNBC quoted Jobs -- who in 2004 said he had undergone successful surgery to remove a rare type of pancreatic cancer -- as saying in an interview, "I'm doing just fine. I'm healthy." Earlier on Tuesday, Jobs had poked fun at reports of his poor health. At an event to unveil a new line of iPod digital music players, he stood in front of a screen that said "The reports of my death are greatly exaggerated."
