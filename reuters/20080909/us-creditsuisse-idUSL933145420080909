 ZURICH  (Reuters) - Swiss bank giant Credit Suisse Group said on Tuesday it was in good shape despite the subprime-led financial crisis and looked to seize opportunities arising from the turmoil. 

 Credit Suisse is "well-positioned to create long-term value and seize opportunities that arise from market dislocation", said David Mathers, head of Finance, Investment Banking, in slides for a Lehman Brothers financial services conference in New York. Credit Suisse has done better in the crisis than its direct rival UBS, so far the hardest-hit European bank. Investors expect UBS and other banks damaged by the crisis to sell part of their business. Credit Suisse shares were up 2.6 percent at 54.44 Swiss francs at 4:27 a.m. EDT. In the slides, Mathers said private banking, where UBS is losing clients, continued to deliver good results and the bank saw "solid results across most investment banking and asset management businesses", Mathers is due to start speaking at 1300 GMT.
