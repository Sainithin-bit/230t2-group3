 UNIVERSITY HEIGHTS, Ohio  (Reuters) - Risk-taking is essential for both economic and personal progress, a top U.S. Federal Reserve official said on Sunday, urging a group of graduates to "reach for that next rung." 

 "History shows that economic progress resembles climbing a ladder," Cleveland Federal Reserve Bank President Sandra Pianalto said in a commencement address at John Carroll University. "Each rung of that ladder is an innovation or a new stage in economic development." "If we are not willing to let go of the rung we are holding onto, even though it involves fear and loss as we abandon the familiar ... we can't reach for new and greater heights," she said. "This is true for the individual as well as the entire economy." She did not touch on the outlook for the U.S. economy or Fed interest-rate policy in her remarks.
