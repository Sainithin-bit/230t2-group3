 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Hologic Inc. ( HOLX.O ) on Sunday said it had offered $6.2 billion in cash and stock to buy Cytyc Corp. CYTC.O in hopes of creating a leading women's health-care company. Hologic and Cytyc, which both make diagnostic and other medical products for women, said the deal is expected to close in the third quarter and will boost Hologic's earnings in the first year afterward and more so in following years. The combined entity would operate in more than 20 countries and have more than 3,300 employees, the companies said in a joint release. Under the deal, Cytyc shareholders would receive 0.52 shares of Hologic common stock and $16.50 in cash for each share of Cytyc stock they own. That represents $46.46 per share, or a 33 percent premium to Cytyc's share price, based on the closing stock prices on Friday of both companies, they said.
