 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Digital mammography machine seller 
Hologic Inc. ( HOLX.O ) said on Sunday that Cytyc Corp. CYTC.O, 
maker of ThinPrep cervical cancer tests, agreed to be bought 
for $6.2 billion in cash and stock in a deal that would more 
than double Hologic's revenue. 

  Under the deal, Cytyc shareholders would receive 0.52 
shares of Hologic common stock and $16.50 in cash for each 
share of Cytyc stock they own. That represents $46.46 per 
share, or a 33 percent premium to Cytyc's share price, based on 
the closing stock prices on Friday of both companies.  The deal must be approved by shareholders of both companies 
and federal anti-trust officials.  The acquisition, which would expand Hologic's product and 
geographic reach while providing cost-cutting opportunities, is 
expected to close in the third calendar quarter.  Hologic said the purchase will add more than 10 cents per 
share to its consensus adjusted earnings in the first year 
after the close and be significantly more accretive thereafter.  "We expect to realize the benefits of this combination 
quickly and efficiently," Jack Cumming, Hologic's chairman and 
chief executive officer, said in a statement.  For the fiscal year ended September 2008, the companies 
forecast combined revenue in excess of $1.7 billion, and 
combined adjusted earnings per share of $2.35 to $2.40.  Prior to announcement of the deal, analysts' average 
revenue call for fiscal 2008 for Hologic was $852.4 million, 
according to Reuters Estimates.  (Additional reporting by  Lisa Baertlein  in Los Angeles)
