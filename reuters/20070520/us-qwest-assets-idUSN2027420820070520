 DENVER  (Reuters) - Federal prosecutors have asked a judge to immediately freeze the assets of former Qwest Communications International Inc. Chief Executive Joseph Nacchio, who was convicted last month of making $52 million from insider trading. 

 In a motion filed on Friday in Denver federal court, prosecutors said Nacchio and his wife, Anne Esker, have assets derived from the sales of Qwest stock worth "well more than $100 million," which is subject to forfeiture under federal law. In the alternative, prosecutors said, Nacchio should deposit the more than $52 million gross that a jury found he made on the illegal trades. "The United States is concerned about whether, without further delay, there will be assets to satisfy any forfeiture (as well as any fines)," prosecutors said in the filing. Nacchio, 57, on April 19 was found guilty of selling Qwest stock in 2001 based on information unknown to investors. Several former Qwest executives testified at the trial that Nacchio knew the telephone carrier was meeting its quarterly revenue targets with accounting maneuvers, rather than actual business growth. According to the filing, Nacchio and his wife own three homes in New Jersey and one in Florida. Additionally, the couple owns two Porsche automobiles, a Mercedes-Benz and a BMW. "Mr. Nacchio has property interests that can satisfy his forfeiture obligations," prosecutors said. The government is also asking U.S. District Judge Edward Nottingham to order that Nacchio provide an itemization of all assets owned by him or his wife, as well as the assets "of any Nacchio family foundation or trust." Denver-based Qwest, the nation's third-largest telephone carrier, became the target of federal prosecutors and regulators during Nacchio's tenure. During Nacchio's selling flurry in April and May 2001, Qwest was trading between $38.31 and $41.12 on the New York Stock Exchange, and plummeted to below $2 by June 2002 when he was forced out as CEO. Earlier this year, Nacchio was found guilty on 19 counts of a 42-count insider trading indictment, and acquitted on the remaining 23 counts. He is scheduled to be sentenced July 27, but his attorneys said they would appeal the conviction. Nacchio, one in a string of U.S. executives to be convicted of criminal charges stemming from a decade of corporate scandals, faces a $1 million fine per count, asset forfeiture and a potential prison sentence, all to be determined by the judge.
