 ROME  (Reuters) - Capitalia's chief executive Matteo Arpe rose to fame as a young, market-savvy upstart in the stodgy world of Italian banking, but on Sunday made a quiet exit from the bank he rescued from deep financial troubles. 

 With Capitalia about to be swallowed up by larger rival UniCredit for more than $29 billion, Arpe resigned while the man who tried to oust him, Capitalia's chairman Cesare Geronzi, looked set to take up a new position in the combined group. Arpe's exit comes after six years at the Rome-based bank where he engineered a rapid turnaround that won him fans amongst international investors. But a public spat with Geronzi nearly cost him his job three months ago. Never the best of friends, Arpe openly criticized the warm welcome given by Geronzi to two foreign investors in the bank in February by recalling the story of a Milanese duke who sought help from the French only to have his would-be rescuers imprison him. Known in Italian business circles as a wily banker with handy political contacts, Geronzi moved quickly to oust Arpe. Within days Capitalia's board and a group of key investors had convened meetings to discuss firing the 42-year old, who refused to resign and instead accused the head of the bank's shareholder pact of improper conduct. Hours before his dismissal was to have been sealed, Arpe kept his job with a letter to Geronzi in which he apologized for "any misunderstanding that may have emerged between us". Though Arpe retained the CEO title Geronzi moved to strip him of key powers and succeeded in consolidating control over the bank's merger strategy. Though Arpe later sought to play down the rift as history, tensions remained high. At a day-long Capitalia shareholder meeting in April the two executives sat side by side but rarely conferred or spoke to each other. "The key thing is that he and Geronzi can't be in the same room, and probably not in the same bank," said Simon Maughan, a bank analyst at Blue Oak Capital. BANK HEARTTHROB Arpe, a junior chess champion, entered the banking world in 1987 after graduating from Milan's Bocconi University with highest honors. He started at Italian merchant bank Mediobanca, but left in 1999 when he saw few career prospects there, moving on to Lehman Brothers as an investment banker. He joined Capitalia in 2001 as head of its wholesale bank and quickly rose up the ranks to become chief executive of the entire bank in 2003. Capitalia's share price soared on Arpe's watch, rising to nearly 8 euros on Friday from 1.755 euros at the end of July 2005. Fluent in English and at ease with analysts whom he regularly met, Arpe also built up a base of international investors in the bank who formed the backbone of his support. When a tired and haggard looking Arpe presented the bank's 2006 results in Milan in February just hours after hanging on to his job he was greeted by a long round of applause from analysts. Merrill Lynch even dubbed Arpe as a 'little Red Riding Hood' taking on Geronzi as the 'big Bad Wolf'. "In five years of hard work Little Red Riding Hood transformed the poor lodge into a fabulous castle (named Hedge Fund Hotel), apparently the object of desire of neighboring landlords," Merrill analysts wrote at the time. "The friendly relationship between the two started to shake when different thoughts on what to do with the castle arose." He also introduced a number of customer-friendly features like keeping bank branches open at lunch times and on Saturdays and turned some of the bank's bigger branches into one-stop shops. With his wavy brown hair and blue eyes, Arpe also won his fair share of attention for his rakish good looks and came to be dubbed "the heartthrob of the banks". Uncertain as to where Arpe is headed next, Italian media say he will take over 30 million euros with him, giving him ample opportunity to become a consultant or set up his own business.
