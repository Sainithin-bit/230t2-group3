 KAZAN, Russia  (Reuters) - Ukraine will achieve full convertibility of its hryvnia currency within a year and a half and investors should prepare for the currency to become more freely floating, a senior central banker said on Sunday. 

 "In one to one-and-a-half years the Ukrainian hryvnia will be a fully convertible currency -- like the Russian rouble and the Kazakh tenge," said Oleksandr Savchenko, deputy chairman of the National Bank of Ukraine. Speaking at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development's annual meeting, Savchenko said it was important to secure government backing for the move. He also noted that legislation to create partial convertibility was being held up by Ukraine's political crisis, with uncertainty over when the country will hold a general election.
