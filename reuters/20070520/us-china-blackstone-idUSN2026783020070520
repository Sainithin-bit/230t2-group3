 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - China's new state investment firm on Sunday said it plans to make a $3 billion investment in the Blackstone Group, one of the most prominent and powerful U.S. private equity firms. 

 China's soon-to-be-established foreign exchange investment company would make the investment in the form of nonvoting common units of Blackstone, a firm that has been at the forefront of a global boom in mergers and acquisitions. China announced in March it was setting up a vehicle to help diversify part of its $1.202 trillion of foreign exchange reserves, the world's largest, to improve returns and diversify risk. State media have said the new agency could manage up to $200 billion, although some Chinese economists have called for twice that amount to be at its disposal. "This is a very, very significant move and it symbolizes that China believes in America," said Frank Holmes, chief executive of U.S. Global Investors Inc. "We are talking about a very sophisticated country. This is an excellent strategy for them to bring their dollars back into America." The announcement comes just days before this week's planned visit to the United States of a delegation led by Chinese Vice Premier Wu Yi to discuss sticking points in bilateral trade relations. U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson will host the meetings, as part of a strategic economic dialogue set up last year. The Chinese investment company said it plans to have less than a 10 percent equity stake in Blackstone immediately after Blackstone completes its pending initial public offering and aims to hold its investment for at least four years. BIG BETS New York-based Blackstone, known for taking huge companies private, in March filed to bring part of itself public in an offering worth $4 billion. The firm said raising funds through the public offering would give it quick and steady access to money it would otherwise have to take time to raise privately. Blackstone's recent deals include the $23 billion purchase of Equity Office Properties Trust and the $17.6 billion buyout of Freescale Semiconductor. It is one of the few U.S. private investment firms to ever take itself public. Sunday's news follows a move earlier this year by Blackstone to expand its investing in the Asia-Pacific region. On January 10, Blackstone said it planned to open a private equity office in Hong Kong and that Antony Leung, who was financial secretary of Hong Kong from 2001 to 2003, joined the firm as a senior managing director and chairman of Blackstone Greater China. Blackstone said then that Leung would co-head Blackstone's Hong Kong office along with Ben Jenkins, a senior managing director, who would relocate with a team from New York. The firm said it may open more offices in the region as its business grows.
