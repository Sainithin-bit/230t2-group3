 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - The European Commission wants to 
cooperate closely with the U.S. Securities and Exchange 
Commission (SEC) on the planned regulation of credit rating 
agencies, the German financial weekly Euro am Sonntag reported. 

  "Because of the importance of the U.S. financial markets it 
would make no sense to take action in isolation," the paper 
quoted Charlie McCreevy, the 27-mation European Union's 
internal market commissioner, as saying.  McCreevy hopes that a draft proposal would be ready in 
October, making it possible for a new regulatory framework to 
take effect next year, Euro am Sonntag said in a preview 
received on Saturday of an article due for publication in the 
weekly's print edition on Sunday.  The credit rating agencies include Standard & Poor's (S&P), 
a unit of McGraw Hill MHP.N, Moody's ( MCO.N ) and Fitch, part 
of Fimalac ( LBCP.PA ). The agencies have come under fire for 
their role in the U.S. subprime mortgage crisis, which led to a 
global credit squeeze and big asset write downs at many banks.  McCreevy outlined a five-point regulatory framework 
consisting of mandatory registration; measures to cope with 
potential conflicts of interest; quality standards and methods; 
transparency obligations; as well as reporting and supervision.  It remained open which entity would take charge of 
supervising the rating agencies, he said, adding there were 
various options such as "a stronger involvement of the CESR 
(Committee of European Securities Regulators) in Paris."  (Reporting by  Peter Starck )
