 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The cost to protect debt of CIT Group with credit default swaps fell on Tuesday after the New York-based commercial lender said it agreed to sell its home lending business and other holdings for expected net cash proceeds of $1.8 billion. 

 CIT's five-year credit default swaps fell 55 basis points to 715 basis points, or $715,000 a year to protect $10 million of debt, according to Phoenix Partners Group.  (Reporting by  Walden Siew ; Editing by  James Dalgleish )
