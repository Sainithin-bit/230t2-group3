 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Chrysler LLC said on Tuesday its June sales fell 36 percent from a year earlier due to tumbling demand for trucks and SUVs and continued reductions in fleet sales. 

 Chrysler sold 117,457 vehicles in June, down from 183,347 units a year ago. The figures were not adjusted for the difference in selling days in June compared with a year earlier. (Reporting by  Soyoung Kim ; Editing by  Andre Grenon )
