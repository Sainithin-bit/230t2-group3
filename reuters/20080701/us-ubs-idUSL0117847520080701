 ZURICH  (Reuters) - UBS AG failed to calm investors' fears of further asset writedowns on Tuesday, dishing out instead a restructuring of top management and sending the shares to a fresh 10-year low. 

 UBS, Europe's biggest casualty of the credit crisis and under fire from investors for shoddy corporate governance, said it would dismantle the office of chairman, a key demand of one of its top shareholders, activist investor Olivant. UBS stock -- also under pressure after Merrill Lynch removed it from a list of preferred stocks -- closed down 5.3 percent at 20.30 francs, extending Monday's losses to below the 21 franc price on its $15.5 billion deeply discounted rights issue. Investors are worried not only about possible further losses on investments but also that UBS may ask shareholders for more cash. "There is talk that UBS will propose another capital hike," one Zurich-based trader said. But UBS Chairman Peter Kurer told Swiss television channel SF1 in an interview UBS would not need further capital. "I am quite clearly of the opinion that this won't be the case," he told the television channel. "We will be back on track by the end of the year." He said there was a rocky road ahead of UBS with many problems that still needed to be addressed, but he confirmed that the bank was aiming to return to profit next year. In another interview with Swiss newspaper Finanz und Wirtschaft, Kurer said the bank's restructuring process was well under way. RISK POSITION "We have lowered our risk position strongly, reduced our balance sheet by several hundred million francs and set up an aggressive cost-cutting program," he told the paper. "That's in addition to two capital increases, a change in management, a change in risk control and mainly the repositioning of the investment bank," he said. He declined to comment on second-quarter results. UBS is under pressure from the Swiss financial watchdog and investors to overhaul its business after more than $37 billion in writedowns during the global credit turmoil. "Apparently, UBS blames its corporate governance -- with a chairman who also had executive power and no real supervisory function -- for its subprime debacle," said Landsbanki Kepler analyst Dirk Becker. "With its new governance, it wants to ensure that such an accident can never happen again. However, as this won't help to get it out of the current crisis, we regard this announcement as a non-event," Becker said. Recommendations of a governance committee -- including strengthening the board's overseeing role and a clear separation of the responsibilities of the board of directors and executive management -- would be implemented immediately, UBS said. Olivant, which had criticized the chairman's office for having too much sway over executive management, welcomed the changes. Four board members will resign, and replacements will be elected at an extraordinary general meeting planned for October 2, UBS said. Sergio Marchionne, chief executive of Italian automaker Fiat SpA, will fill a new post as senior independent director, and continue as non-executive vice-chairman of UBS. The board and its strategy committee are continuing their review of the strategic positioning of the bank and its businesses, UBS said. (Additional reporting by  Katie Reid , editing by Will Waterman)
