 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Nissan North America Inc said on Tuesday overall sales fell 7.5 percent on an adjusted basis in June from a year earlier as higher sedan sales failed to offset the decline in demand for trucks. 

 Nissan-brand sales fell 8.3 percent in June, while sales of its luxury Infiniti brand were down 0.9 percent for the month, the automaker said. Al Castignetti, vice president and general manager of the Nissan Division for Nissan North America, said demand for vehicles slowed down in the latter half of last month. "We saw a pretty robust first 15 days and a slowdown after that," he said, adding that Nissan likely outperformed the overall auto market. For the Nissan brand, sales of cars rose 4.4 percent from a year earlier, while truck sales fell 30.1 percent. There were 24 selling days in June compared with 27 a year earlier. U.S. consumers were moving to cheaper and more fuel-efficient vehicles, Castignetti said, adding that the company's hybrid car sales rose 86.5 percent to 1,333 vehicles in June.
