 DETROIT  (Reuters) - General Motors Corp posted an 8.3 percent decline in June U.S. auto sales after adjusting for sales days in the month, a better-than-expected result for the embattled automaker. 

 GM sold 265,937 vehicles in June, down 18.5 percent before adjusting for three fewer sales days in June than in the same month a year earlier. Boosted by a month-end sale and zero-percent financing, GM's sales tally was high enough for it to remain the sales leader in the U.S. market, ahead of Toyota Motor Corp for June. Shares of GM, which touched a 54-year low on Monday, moved higher on the June sales data. In afternoon trade, GM shares were up 3 percent on the New York Stock Exchange.
