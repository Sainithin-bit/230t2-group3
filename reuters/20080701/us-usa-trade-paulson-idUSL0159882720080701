 BERLIN  (Reuters) - Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson on Tuesday said the United States and Germany agreed that a breakthrough in the Doha round of trade talks would help control world food price inflation, but high oil prices required longer-term solutions. 

 Paulson, speaking at a news conference in Berlin with German Economy Minister Michael Glos, said the two nations agreed there were "no obvious short-term solutions" to high oil prices. He added the current oil price was a function of supply and demand. "There's no doubt that both our countries as well as the world are feeling the burden of high oil prices and high food prices," Paulson said after a breakfast meeting with Glos. He later met with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and was due to meet with European Central Bank chief Jean-Claude Trichet in Frankfurt on a five-day trip to Europe and Russia, where rising inflation tops the policy agenda. "We agreed that a breakthrough in Doha would help us in the food area," Paulson said. "Policies that restrict trade in food products aren't helpful. Export controls aren't helpful." Regarding oil prices, Paulson said he and Glos agreed that little could be done in the short term, but more investment was needed in alternative energy and reducing fuel consumption. He has consistently denied that the weaker U.S. dollar and futures market speculation were significant factors driving oil prices higher. Glos said he believed that high energy prices were feeding into food prices, and in the short term a "temporary" increase in oil output would help dampen prices to bridge a gap for oil consuming countries to allow them to develop alternative fuel technologies that would reduce consumption. Paulson also said German and other European banks were still dealing with common credit problems and were supportive of the coordinated policy responses between the United States and Europe. "A number of the German banks are dealing with the same issues that the U.S. banks are dealing with and the banks around Europe, which have to do with too much leverage -- maybe more than was perceived to be the case earlier -- dealing with complex products, and they're still in the process of repricing risk." He said both German banks and European banks are supportive of actions recommended by the Financial Stability Forum and the U.S. President's Working Group on Capital Markets for more market discipline, better risk management, improvements to the securitization of process and some regulatory changes. "We have a combined approach, which is very complimentary and I think our two countries are on the same page in strengthening the financial system," Paulson said. On Wednesday, Paulson is expected to reveal more details in a London speech about his accelerated plans for the Federal Reserve to assume a larger regulatory role in maintaining financial system stability. In the wake of the Fed-engineered buyout of stricken Wall Street investment bank Bear Stearns in March, Paulson has urged quick action to give the Fed a permanent authority to make liquidity available to a broader range of financial institutions when financial system stability is threatened. The Fed and Securities and Exchange Commission are nearing an agreement to share information on investment banks. (Reporting by David Lawder; Editing by Malcolm Whittaker)
