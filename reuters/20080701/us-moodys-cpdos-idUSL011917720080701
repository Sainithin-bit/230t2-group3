 LONDON  (Reuters) - Moody's Investors Service ( MCO.N ) said it was disciplining employees for considering inappropriate issues in approving triple-A ratings for complicated debt products called constant proportion debt obligations (CPDOs). 

 The ratings agency, already under fire over its rating of U.S. subprime-related debt products, launched an investigation in May as the Financial Times newspaper reported that a coding error in a computer model caused CPDOs, European products based on credit default swaps, to be rated four notches higher than they would have been. The investigation found that its staff made no changes to its methodology of rating CPDOs to mask any model error, Moody's said on Tuesday. But it concluded that some members of a European CPDO monitoring committee "considered factors inappropriate to the rating process when reviewing CPDO ratings following the discovery of the model error". Moody's has started disciplinary proceedings against certain employees involved in CPDO monitoring and supervision, which could lead to them being dismissed, it said. "I am deeply disappointed by the conduct that occurred in this incident," said Moody's Chairman and Chief Executive Raymond McDaniel in a statement. "In response, we are taking immediate and appropriate action to address the lapse in our rating process and to ensure that a similar event does not occur again," he added. The ratings involved 11 CPDOs with a combined value of slightly less than $1 billion, the agency said. "Testing of the CPDO model's output, after correction for the error and without consideration of qualitative factors, indicated that an initial rating of Aaa would have been in the Aa range."
