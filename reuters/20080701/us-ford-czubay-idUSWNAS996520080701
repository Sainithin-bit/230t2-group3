 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co said on Tuesday has named a 38-year auto industry veteran to the post of vice president of U.S. sales and marketing effective July 16 to assist in the company's sales turnaround efforts. 

 Ken Czubay, 59, will report to global marketing head Jim Farley, and oversee the day-to-day sales and marketing efforts for the Ford, Lincoln and Mercury brands, Ford said. The appointment will leave Farley more free to work with global product development head Derrick Kuzak on the turnaround efforts, Ford said. Czubay worked at Ford from 1970 to 1983 and currently is serving as president of Southeast Toyota Distributors LLC and holds other positions. (Reporting by  David Bailey ; editing by Carol Bishopric)
