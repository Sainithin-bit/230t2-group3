 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp sees U.S. industrywide vehicle sales hitting bottom this year with a modest recovery in 2009. 

 Toyota executives said on Tuesday the Japanese automaker expects a substantial rebound in U.S. auto sales in 2010 and beyond. Toyota earlier posted a 11.5 percent decline in U.S. June sales. (Reporting by  Poornima Gupta , editing by Phil Berlowitz)
