 (Reuters) - Chipmaker Standard Microsystems Corp SMSC.O posted a higher first-quarter profit, which edged past market expectations, but forecast second-quarter results significantly below analysts' average estimates. 

 The company projected earnings of 45 cents to 49 cents a share, excluding items, on revenue of $97 million to $99 million for the second quarter. Analysts on average were expecting a profit of 53 cents a share, before special items, on revenue of $101.4 million, according to Reuters Estimates. For the first quarter ended May 31, net income rose to $4.5 million, or 20 cents a share, from $3.2 million, or 14 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding items, it earned 39 cents a share. Revenue rose 13.8 percent to $92.8 million, helped by an increase in analog and automotive infotainment product sales. Analysts expected the company, which sells silicon-based integrated circuits, to earn 38 cents a share, excluding items, on revenue of $91.2 million. Shares of the Hauppauge, New York-based company closed at $27.15 Monday on Nasdaq. (Reporting by  Deepti Govind  in Bangalore; Editing by Himani Sarkar)
