 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Honda Motor Co said on Tuesday its U.S. sales rose 13.8 percent in June on an adjusted basis, the only major automaker so far to show a gain in sales for the month. 

 Honda, which has the most fuel-efficient line-up of any major manufacturer, said sales of its Fit subcompact sedan more than doubled to a record 10,003 in the month. Total car sales were up 34.2 percent at 97,639. U.S. sales of rivals Ford Motor Co, Nissan Motor Co and Toyota Motor Corp were all down for June. General Motors Corp and Chrysler LLC were expected to report June results later on Tuesday. Sales were adjusted for three less selling days last month than in June 2007, a measure of U.S. sales performance favored by most automakers. (Reporting by  Poornima Gupta ; editing by John Wallace)
