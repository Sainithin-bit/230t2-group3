 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Hours before their contract with film and TV performers was due to expire, Hollywood studios on Monday presented the Screen Actors Guild with a "final offer," but there was no immediate response from the union. 

 In a three-page statement circulated to the media, the studios' bargaining agent, the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, said its proposal was worth more than $250 million in additional compensation to SAG members. The existing three-year contract covering movie and prime-time television work for 120,000 SAG members was due to expire at 12:01 a.m. on Tuesday, and the two sides have remained at odds for months over the terms of a new deal. The labor talks, which began in April, have hit some of the same stumbling blocks that led Hollywood writers to walk off the job months ago, including clashes over how union talent should be paid for work created for the Internet.
