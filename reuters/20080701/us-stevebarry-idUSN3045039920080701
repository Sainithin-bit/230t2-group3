 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Retailer Steve & Barry's LLC is readying plans to close more than 100 of its stores, and is contemplating a full liquidation should it not find emergency financing, the Wall Street Journal reported on its website on Monday. 

 The article, citing people familiar with the company, said the retail chain is seeking a tentative plan for about $40 million in debtor-in-possession financing if it must file for bankruptcy protection. Steve & Barry could not immediately be reached for comment. The report said that last weekend, Steve & Barry's bankruptcy counsel, Weil Gotshal & Manges LLP, prepared for a potential bankruptcy filing as soon as this week. The article said bankruptcy attorney Harvey Miller is handling the case. Miller could not immediately be reached for comment. (Reporting by  Nicole Maestri ; Editing by  Gary Hill )
