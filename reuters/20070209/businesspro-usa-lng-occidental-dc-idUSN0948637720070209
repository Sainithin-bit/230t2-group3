 HOUSTON  (Reuters) - A unit of Occidental Chemical Co. 
( OXY.N ) has pushed back planned construction of a liquefied 
natural gas (LNG) terminal near Corpus Christi, Texas, a 
company spokeswoman said Friday. 


  The schedule calling for start-up of Ingleside Energy 
Center in 2008 is now "to be determined," spokeswoman Jan 
Sieving said. "We're working through some commercial issues."  The decision was made in January, she said.  Ingleside, intended to unload LNG from ships, regasify it 
and ship as much as 1 billion cubic feet of gas per day, is 
still licensed by the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission, Sieving said.  Forecasts for declining U.S. gas production and expected 
high prices for imported LNG triggered more than 40 proposals 
for new terminals after 2000. Recent shifts in the market have 
slowed growth.  One new U.S. terminal has opened offshore in the Gulf of 
Mexico. Five others are under construction along the U.S. Gulf 
Coast. Twenty others have been approved by various U.S. 
agencies but have not started construction.  Another new terminal has opened on the Mexican Gulf Coast. 
Others are under construction in eastern Canada and western 
Mexico.
