 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The following is a summary of recent comments by Fed policy-makers: 


 * Denotes 2007 voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets U.S. monetary policy. DALLAS FED PRESIDENT RICHARD FISHER, FEB. 9: "No central banker can ever be smug about containing the risk of inflation, but I am pleased with the current direction of inflationary impulses. "If (rate) increases are needed, I would aggressively advocate for them. But for now I am as comfortable with the inflationary outlook as a prudent central banker can be." CLEVELAND FED PRESIDENT SANDRA PIANALTO, FEB. 9: "The national inflation picture has been clouded in the past few years by large swings in energy, commodity and housing prices. As these markets normalize, and as we gain a clearer picture of the underlying inflation trend, we may see that some inflation risks remain. "In that case, some additional policy firming may be needed -- depending, of course, on the outlook for both inflation and economic growth." * ST. LOUIS FED PRESIDENT WILLIAM POOLE, FEB. 9: "Recent inflation data themselves and other information relevant to judging the inflation outlook suggest that the inflation rate is likely to fall into a reasonable range this year. "If, however, core inflation seems to be settling at a rate above 2 percent, then such an outcome would be unacceptable to me. I put a very high weight on the Fed's responsibility to maintain low and stable inflation." PHILADELPHIA FED PRESIDENT CHARLES PLOSSER, FEB. 7: "With growth prospects of the economy improving, there is some risk that we may not see a return to price stability unless monetary conditions are further tightened. "While I think it is possible that the recent moderation of inflation will continue ... I believe it is too soon to declare victory." * FED CHAIRMAN BEN BERNANKE, FEB. 6: "The challenge for policy is not to eliminate inequality per se but rather to spread economic opportunity as widely as possible. Policies that focus on education, job training and skills and that facilitate job search and job mobility seem to be promising means for moving forward that goal." SAN FRANCISCO FED PRESIDENT JANET YELLEN, FEB. 6: "Inflation is a little higher than I would like it to be; I would like inflation to come down. "Outside of housing and autos we have an economy that's operating pretty nicely and just a little bit below trend." FEDERAL OPEN MARKET COMMITTEE, JAN. 31: "Recent indicators have suggested somewhat firmer economic growth, and some tentative signs of stabilization have appeared in the housing market. Overall, the economy seems likely to expand at a moderate pace over coming quarters. "Readings on core inflation have improved modestly in recent months, and inflation pressures seem likely to moderate over time. However, the high level of resource utilization has the potential to sustain inflation pressures. "The Committee judges that some inflation risks remain. The extent and timing of any additional firming that may be needed to address these risks will depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming information." * KANSAS CITY FED PRESIDENT THOMAS HOENIG, JAN. 19: "Monetary policy from my perspective right now is moderately restrictive. And in that context, I think, has the ability to continue to bring the inflation rate down." RICHMOND FED PRESIDENT JEFFREY LACKER, JAN. 19: "The risk that core inflation surges again, or does not subside as desired, clearly remains the predominant macroeconomic policy risk. "I'm not quite sure if I've changed my mind of where inflation is going to be the first half of this year." * FED GOVERNOR SUSAN BIES, JAN. 18: "Inflation appears poised to decelerate in coming months as energy prices stabilize and resource pressures ease. But a decline in the inflation rate is not assured. "The economy is really solid ... we're still running at a good pace." Bies will step down on March 30, and does not plan to attend the March 20-21 FOMC meeting. * FED CHAIRMAN BEN BERNANKE, JAN. 18: "If early and meaningful action is not taken, the U.S. economy could be seriously weakened, with future generations bearing much of the cost" from the budgetary strains posed by an aging U.S. population. "The longer we wait, the more severe, the more draconian, the more difficult the adjustments are going to be." * FED GOVERNOR FREDERIC MISHKIN, JAN. 17: "Monetary policy-makers should restrict their efforts to achieving their dual mandate of stabilizing inflation and employment, and should not alter policy to have preemptive effects on asset prices." * BOSTON FED PRESIDENT CATHY MINEHAN, JAN. 12: "I expect growth to accelerate modestly as 2007 progresses, with the housing and inventory situations gradually ebbing. With a growth path at or slightly below potential, unemployment is likely to remain below 5 percent while core inflation should continue to ease."
