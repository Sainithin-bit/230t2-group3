 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The first U.S.-listed hedge fund soared 89 percent on Friday in a debut that is seen as likely to encourage others to list. 


 Fortress Investment Group LLC's ( FIG.N ) shares opened at $35 after pricing at $18.50 the day before, in the best debut for a U.S. IPO since commodities exchange NYMEX Holdings Inc. NMX.N more than doubled on its first day of trading last November. Early buyers in the open market may have been disappointed as the shares slipped to $31 in afternoon trading. Until now the long-secretive hedge fund industry has been reluctant to invite the kind of scrutiny that goes with a public listing. But Fortress' success in raising capital in the public markets and giving its founders a chance to cash out some of their stakes, may set a precedent for other funds looking to do the same thing. Sol Waksman, president of Barclay Trading Group, a firm that compiles hedge fund data, said he now expects others to consider going public. "If I were a hedge fund and saw the demand, I would certainly investigate it," said Waksman. "Obviously demand is there. They are able to capitalize on market sentiment right now and get a healthy multiple." The offering helped put an exclamation point on a revival in IPOs after a lackluster January. Two other market debuts, online auto parts supplier U.S. Auto Parts Network Inc. ( PRTS.O ) and Natural gas provider Targa Resources Partners LP NGLS.O also did well on Friday, rising 21 percent and 14 percent, respectively. Sears Holding Corp. ( SHLD.O ) shares also jumped as much as 3.6 percent to $187.28, a day after stock picker Jim Cramer told viewers of his "Mad Money" program on CNBC that the Fortress IPO would give investors a yardstick by which to measure Sears' investment business. Fortress is the second largest IPO of the year in terms of deal value -- behind only Wednesday's $798 million offering from National CineMedia Inc. ( NCMI.O ) -- and the year's biggest first day gainer, according to data tracker Dealogic. POSSIBLE TREND Waksman said the fund-raising potential for public offerings would likely outweigh hedge fund managers' historical penchant for secrecy. Furthermore, public disclosure requirements do not completely lift the shroud covering hedge funds. Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan & Chase & Co., for instance trade many hedged strategies through their giant proprietary trading desk and hedge funds, which few outsiders see. The shares of the U.K.'s Man Group ( EMG.L ), the world's largest listed hedge fund company, with more than $60 billion under management, have more than doubled over the past two years. Fortress has ballooned from its inception in 1998, growing assets to $29.7 billion at the end of September 2006 from $1.2 billion at the end of 2001. Net income rose to $192.7 million in 2005 from $40.3 million in 2003. HEAVY DEMAND Due in part to its financial performance, the company packed rooms for its road show presentations, which led to shares being "massively" oversubscribed, said Scott Sweet, managing director for IPO research firm IPOboutique.com. "Road shows were wall to wall and standing room only," Sweet added. On Thursday, the offering priced at the top of a $16.50 to $18.50 forecast range, raising $634 million. Fortress could use the proceeds to reward employees and make acquisitions, it said in a regulatory filing, as well as to repay debt. The offering price gave the New York-based company an initial market capitalization of more than $7.4 billion. The offering represents 8.5 percent of total shares in the company, but principals of the firm -- Peter Briger, Wesley Edens, Robert Kauffman, Randal Nardone and Michael Novogratz -- own 100 percent of the class B shares and about 78 percent of shareholder voting power. Underwriters, led by Goldman Sachs and Lehman Brothers, Banc of America Securities LLC, Citigroup and Deutsche Bank Securities, have the option to buy an additional 5.1 million Class A shares to cover overallotments.
