 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - European share prices rose in early trade on Friday on the back of a string of corporate news and higher oil prices, while investors eyed the Group of Seven finance ministers meeting in Germany. 


 A 2.2-percent rise in DaimlerChrysler DCXGn.DE shares pushed up the DJ Stoxx European auto sector index .SXAP after Citigroup upgraded the shares to a "buy" from a "hold". The pan-European FTSEurofirst index  .FTEU3  of 300 leading shares rose 0.5 percent to 1,542.74 points by 0853 GMT. London's FTSE 100  .FTSE  gained 0.7 percent and the French CAC 40  .FCHI  and Germany's DAX  .GDAXI  rose 0.6 percent. "In the short term we think that stock markets will continue to rise. But we are more skeptical in the mid term," Thomas Gruener, analyst at Landesbank Berlin said. Oil prices CLc1 gained 0.3 percent to $59.88 a barrel, after rising above $60 a barrel earlier for the first time in a month. BP ( BP.L ) and Total ( TOTF.PA ) shares were up 1 percent. Gold rose temporarily above $660 an ounce, but struggled to hold the gains as dealers turned their attention to a Group of Seven finance ministers' meeting starting later in the day in Essen, Germany. Copper recovered from lows on Thursday. Mining stocks such as BHP Billiton ( BLT.L ), Anglo American ( AAL.L ) and Xstrata XTA.L rose more than 1 percent. Among major movers, Alcatel-Lucent ALU.PA rose 2.6 percent after the French-American telecoms equipment provider said it was stepping up job cuts and reported a fourth quarter loss.
