 MOSCOW  (Reuters) - U.S. oil major Chevron ( CVX.N ) is interested in buying assets of Russia's bankrupt oil firm YUKOS YUKO.MM, the spokesman for YUKOS's receiver said on Friday. 


 "We have received a letter from Chevron and a number of other big international companies about their interest in buying some of YUKOS's assets, specifically in upstream," Nikolai Lashkevich told Reuters. Chevron in Moscow and London declined to comment. Gazprom and state oil firm Rosneft ( ROSN.MM ) are seen as the main contenders for the remaining assets of YUKOS, which the state wants to auction off later this year to recover back taxes. Chevron and fellow U.S. oil major Exxon Mobil ( XOM.N ) were repeatedly rumored to be seeking a major stake in YUKOS before the 2003 arrest of two of YUKOS's key shareholders and the subsequent demise of the firm under a giant back-tax bill. "We are planning to stick to the law when the receiver will review all submitted bids and decide whether to allow bidders to take part in the auction or not," said Lashkevich. The receiver has ordered valuations of the assets, which include two production units, Tomskneft and Samara, with combined output of slightly over 400,000 barrels per day. YUKOS also controls five major refineries and mid-sized gas and power assets. Rosneft already controls YUKOS's former top oil-producing unit, Yugansk.
