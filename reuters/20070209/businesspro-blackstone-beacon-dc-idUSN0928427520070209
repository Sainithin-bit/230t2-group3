 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Blackstone Group's real-estate arm is 
close to a deal to sell office buildings in Seattle and 
Washington, D.C., to Beacon Capital Partners, a Boston-based 
real-estate investment firm, for about $6.5 billion, the Wall 
Street Journal reported on Friday, citing a person familiar 
with the matter. 


  Earlier this week the private equity firm won a three-month 
bidding war to acquire Equity Office Properties Trust EOP.N 
and a source close to the deal told Reuters that Blackstone was 
planning to sell some New York office buildings it acquired 
through the deal to Macklowe Properties for about $7 billion.  Blackstone BG.UL and Beacon could not immediately be 
reached for comment.
