 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Micron Technology Inc. MU.N on Friday forecast that prices for memory chips used in consumer electronics would tumble 30 percent to 40 percent this quarter from the previous one, sending shares down more than 3 percent. 


 Mike Sadler, the company's head of sales, said the falling prices come after Micron boosted production of NAND memory chips and amid an industry glut. Micron is the largest U.S. maker of computer memory chips. He did not detail the potential impact on the company's earnings and said he did not see any signs of strengthening demand for the chips that store information on devices such as digital cameras and digital music players. "It just happens that it is not ideal timing with our ramp up of output when the market is depressed," Sadler said in a telephone interview. Sadler also said that prices for the company's core product -- dynamic random access memory chips used in personal computers -- would fall about 15 percent from the previous quarter. Sales of those chips make up about 60 to 70 percent of the company's revenue while NAND chips contribute less than 20 percent. Micron shares were down 44 cents, or more than 3 percent, to $12.46 in trade on the New York Stock Exchange.
