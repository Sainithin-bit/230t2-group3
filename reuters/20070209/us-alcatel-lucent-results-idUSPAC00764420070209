 PARIS  (Reuters) - Alcatel-Lucent will shed 12,500 jobs or 16 percent of staff, more than expected, as a result of its complex transatlantic merger and it sees tough times ahead with another dip in sales in the first quarter. 


 However, disruptions from Alcatel's acquisition of U.S. telecoms equipment rival Lucent should ease over time and the newly combined business should lift full-year revenues by at least 5 percent, it predicted on Friday. "We expect that we will resume growth after a challenging first quarter...as short-term uncertainties and distractions from the merger are mitigated," Chief Executive Patricia Russo said in a conference call with analysts. Alcatel-Lucent, which issued a profit warning in January, kept its annual dividend unchanged, reassuring those investors who feared the restructuring would put pressure on cash. The pay-out, the in-line annual results and job cuts lifted the shares more than 3 percent. The stock was up 1.77 percent at 10.33 euros by 1321 GMT outperforming the technology index up 0.86 percent. "In summary, while skepticism is likely to remain, we feel management has given some comfort that the issues faced by Alcatel-Lucent are short-term rather than structural," Deutsche Bank said in a note. The Paris-based group incurred a net loss of 618 million euros ($802.3 million) in the three months to December 31, including exceptionals of 755 million euros, compared with a profit of 381 million euros a year earlier. TAKING SCYTHE TO WORKFORCE Workers at Alcatel-Lucent have called for a strike on February 15 to protest against the job cuts which were previously expected to amount to 9,000, or 11 percent of staff. Details on the speed of the downsizing or breakdown were not given. "The cuts will be discussed at each level in each country with organizations representing employees at Alcatel-Lucent," Finance Director Jean-Pascal Beaufret said in a conference call. Alcatel-Lucent said it now expected pre-tax savings of 1.7 billion euros over three years, up from 1.4 billion euros previously. It said a substantial majority of the savings would be achieved in the first two years and 55 percent would be headcount related. "There are still 40 percent more jobs cut than announced (previously) which proves that there are some difficulties that had not been foreseen," Jean-Baptiste Triquet, a member of the CFDT union told Reuters on Friday. The job cuts come after Canada's Nortel Networks, from which Alcatel has acquired its UMTS mobile access unit, said on Wednesday it would slash 2,900 staff, or 8.5 percent of its workforce over the next two years. In spite of the thorough revamp, Alcatel-Lucent proposed a dividend of 0.16 euro a share for 2006, the same it paid for 2001 and for 2005 after a three-year hiatus. Alcatel-Lucent estimated its would spend on the restructuring some 1.6 billion euros in cash, of which 900 million euros would be disbursed in 2007. TOUGH TRADING The results are the first combined between the two groups since they started operating as a merged entity on December 1. "These figures are disappointing indeed...but the fourth quarter does not reflect the benefits of the tie-up between Alcatel and Lucent and the growth potential of our company today," Beaufret said. "We have suffered from tough trading conditions, namely in North America as many of our clients there are consolidating..., so when they merge they delay certain investments," he added. Beaufret added the company suffered from uncertainty created by the tie-up as clients did not know on which products they could rely in the future but he declined to say by how much revenues would decline in the first quarter. "Guidance is disappointing. A year-on-year decline is worse than almost all competitors," Richard Windsor, analyst at Nomura said in a note, retaining a neutral rating on the stock. In the fourth quarter, Alcatel-Lucent made an operating profit of 21 million euros on 16 percent lower fourth-quarter revenues of 4.421 billion euros.
