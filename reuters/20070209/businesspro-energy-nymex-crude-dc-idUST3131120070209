 TOKYO  (Reuters) - U.S. crude oil climbed above $60 a barrel 
for the first time in a month on Friday, extending a gain of $2 
a day earlier, amid signs of falling crude exports from 
producer group OPEC. 


  News that Occidental Petroleum ( OXY.N ) had declared a force 
majeure on oil and gas supplies in Elk Hills, California, was 
also cited as a factor behind the rise. <ID:nN08259646>  Frontmonth U.S. crude for March delivery CLc1 was up 63 
cents at $60.34 a barrel on the Globex electronic trading 
platform, after hitting $60.42 earlier, the highest since 
January 3.  On Thursday, it settled $2.00, or 3.5 percent, higher at
  $59.71.  OPEC's daily exports in January were down 200,000 barrels 
from December, according to shipping data from Lloyd's Marine 
Intelligence Unit, bringing the cartel closer to its pledged 
supply cuts.  The group's exports are expected to edge even lower in 
February, oil consultancy Oil Movements said in a separate 
report.  Adding support to oil prices, Iran's top authority, Supreme 
Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said on Thursday the Islamic 
Republic would target U.S. interests around the world if it 
came under attack over its disputed nuclear program.  Iran, the world's fourth-largest oil exporter, and the 
United States are locked in a war of words over Tehran's 
nuclear program, which Washington says is being channeled into 
bomb-building, a charge Tehran denies.
