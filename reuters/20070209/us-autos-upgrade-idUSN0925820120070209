 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Shares of General Motors Corp ( GM.N ) and Ford Motor Co. ( F.N ) rose on Friday after Deutsche Bank raised its rating on the two U.S. automakers, citing the potential to reduce health-care costs through an agreement with the United Auto Workers union. 


 Deutsche Bank raised its ratings on the struggling automakers to "buy" from "hold." GM shares touched a 52-week high and Ford shares rose 5 percent to touch a three-month high. "Unions appear to be increasingly open to unconventional solutions for competitive challenges such as healthcare," Deutsche Bank analysts Rod Lache, Amit Mehrotra and Chris Struve said in a research note. The brokerage cited the example of the healthcare deal forged by tiremaker Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. GT.N with the United Steelworkers union. "We expect one or more U.S. automakers or suppliers to pursue such a deal with the UAW during 2007 negotiations," according to the research note. Goodyear expects up to $610 million in savings under its three-year contract, and $300 million of annual savings thereafter, because it will transfer its health-care liability relating to current and future retirees to a trust fund. Healthcare costs for GM and Ford add $1,300 and $1,000 per vehicle respectively to the price of cars, putting them at a competitive disadvantage. Fast-growing rival Toyota Motor Corp. ( 7203.T ) and Honda Motor Co. Ltd. ( 7267.T ) have a younger work force and fewer retirees. "It would be fair to say that we have more than a passing interest in the Goodyear agreement," GM Chief Financial Officer Fritz Henderson told analysts in January. Shares of GM were up $1.89, or 5.6 percent, to $35.69 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange, but were off the day's high of $36.62. Ford shares were up 18 cents, or 2.1 percent, to $8.73. GM and Ford have said rising healthcare costs are the biggest challenges facing the companies. Deutsche Bank estimates that healthcare-related GM's expenditure could rise from $5.9 billion in 2006 to $7.4 billion by 2011, while Ford could see costs go up to $4 billion from $2.9 billion in the same period. "If they reach a healthcare solution, U.S. automakers would gain much more flexibility in restructuring and re-sizing their business for profitability," according to Deutsche Bank analysts. "Flexibility should make these companies less risky from the capital market's perspective."
