 TORONTO  (Reuters) - Air Canada ( ACb.TO ) reported a narrower operating loss in the fourth quarter on Friday, as the country's biggest airline enjoyed stronger passenger revenues. 


 Air Canada, which was taken public by parent ACE Aviation Holdings Inc. ACEa.TO in November, had an operating loss of C$5 million, compared with a loss of C$91 million a year earlier. Passenger revenues gained 6 percent to C$2.1 billion, driven by a 5 percent growth in traffic on a capacity growth of 4 percent and a 1 percent yield improvement. ACE Aviation Holdings Inc. ACEa.TO, which holds about 75 percent of Air Canada, said it swung to an operating income of C$73 million in the fourth quarter. That compares with an operating loss of C$34 million in the same period a year earlier. ACE sold a minority stake in Air Canada as part of a long-term plan to spin off all its operating entities, which also include the Aeroplan frequent flier program, Jazz Air regional carrier and ACTS aircraft maintenance unit.
