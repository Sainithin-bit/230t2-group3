 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Univision Communications Inc., 
the largest U.S. Spanish-language broadcaster, said on Friday 
its quarterly net profit more than tripled on strong growth in 
the company's advertising-related business. 


  Fourth-quarter net income rose to $99.7 million, or 29 
cents per share, versus $27.4 million, or 8 cents per share a 
year ago. The 2005 quarter included $30.3 million in 
restructuring charges and $6.6 million in payments to Mexican 
programming partner Televisa.  Excluding items the company said its per-share profit was 
33 cents, above the average Wall Street view of 30 cents, as 
compiled by Reuters Estimates.  Univision is in the midst of a $12.3 billion private equity 
buyout that is expected to be completed in the current quarter. 
The company said it would not issue any earnings forecasts or 
conduct a conference call due to the pending transaction.  Revenue for the quarter rose nearly 7 percent to $546.9 
million on solid growth in its advertising business, especially 
television and radio. Growth in television, radio and Internet 
also helped offset a dip in music revenue, the company said.  Analysts were forecasting revenue of $551.7 million.  Univision shares closed down 7 cents at $35.82 on the New 
York Stock Exchange on Friday.
