 PARIS  (Reuters) - U.S. shares headed for a flat to mildly higher opening on Friday amid a thin corporate and economic diary and as oil prices just below $60 a barrel were likely both to boost energy shares and fan inflation worries. 


 Mastercard ( MA.N ) heads a thin earnings agenda, but ongoing takeover activity could spur buying on selected stocks. Britain's biggest bus company, FirstGroup ( FGP.L ), announced it had agreed to buy Laidlaw International LI.N, the U.S. company that runs Greyhound buses, for $2.8 billion plus debt. By 1100 GMT, U.S. stock futures pointed to gains of around 0.5 percent for the three main indexes SPc1 DJc1 NDc1. On Thursday, the Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  fell 0.23 percent to close at 12,637.63, and the Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  slipped 0.12 percent to 1,448.31, as warnings of losses stemming from bad home loans by two of the top three U.S. subprime mortgage lenders hurt banks like Citigroup ( C.N ). The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  edged down 0.07 percent to 2,488.67. Oil again flirted with $60, briefly rising above the psychologically important level for the first time in a month on more signs of falling OPEC exports and problems at a U.S. oilfield. This was likely to lift energy heavyweights. Other standout movers could include InterMune Inc. ( ITMN.O ), which was likely to come under pressure after the biotechnology company reported a fourth-quarter loss. The stock fell 3.1 percent to $33.40 in after-hours trade on Thursday. Shares of apparel retailer Coldwater Creek ( CWTR.O ) also dropped 5.7 percent to $17.94 after the bell on Thursday as the company provided its financial outlook, and BMC Software Inc. BMC.N shares fell almost 5 percent to $33.60 in late trade on Thursday after the company reported quarterly results.
