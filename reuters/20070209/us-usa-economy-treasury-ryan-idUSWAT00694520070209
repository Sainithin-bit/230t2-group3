 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The Bush administration is considering T. Timothy Ryan, a former top financial regulator who is now with JPMorgan Chase, to become Treasury's point person on international affairs, two sources familiar with the matter said on Friday. 


 If selected, Ryan, 61, would replace Timothy Adams, who announced his resignation a week ago. "I do know that he is under consideration," said one person with knowledge of the discussions, referring to Ryan. "I do know they want to move quickly." A government source also said Ryan, vice chairman for financial institutions and governments at JPMorgan, was being looked at for the job. White House spokesman Tony Fratto declined to comment, as did a Treasury spokeswoman.
