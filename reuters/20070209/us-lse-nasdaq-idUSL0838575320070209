 LONDON  (Reuters) - As Nasdaq's battle for the London Stock Exchange ( LSE.L ) reaches a climax on Saturday, the deadline for shareholders to accept its bid, the LSE's share price suggests the U.S. bourse may fail, analysts said. 


 Nasdaq Stock Markets Inc. ( NDAQ.O ), which owns almost 30 percent of the LSE and is offering 1,243 pence per share, or 2.7 billion pounds ($5.31 billion) in total, is due to post the final number of acceptances on Saturday before 1700 GMT. Under UK takeover rules, the exchange needs to gather 50 percent plus one extra vote from LSE shareholders to take control. Analysts and dealers said the closing price ahead of the weekend may signify whether Nasdaq's offer would succeed or fail. Shares in Europe's biggest share exchange ended unchanged at 1,282 pence, a 3 percent premium to Nasdaq's offer. "But never say never, and of course the lower the price comes to 1243p, the higher the probability it (the bid) will succeed," said Mamoun Tazi, an analyst at Man Financial. LSE shares have steadily crept down from an all-time high of 1,350p on January 19 as expectations of a higher bid have faded and as signs have mounted that increased competition may dent the LSE's revenues. Nasdaq said its offer price also reflected the impact of increased competition from dissatisfied investment banks, which agreed late last year to create a rival trading platform. That plan, called Project Turquoise, is being developed by a group including Citigroup Inc. ( C.N ), Credit Suisse Group ( CSGN.VX ) and Merrill Lynch & Co. MER.N. "I increasingly believe that Project Turquoise will happen. A year ago I wouldn't have believed that 50 percent of the LSE's liquidity would club together to take that business away from the exchange," said Man Financial's Tazi. INDEPENDENT LSE? Some analysts and traders, believing that competitive pressures will curb the LSE's revenues and that its shares have been boosted by a takeover premium, have predicted a sharp fall in the share price if Nasdaq fails. But Man Financial's Tazi reckons the share price should hold up, saying that hedge funds and other investors with interests in LSE stock clearly believe the LSE is worth more than Nasdaq's offer -- a belief the LSE shares. "If you assume Project Turquoise won't happen, the LSE share price could go to 1,500p if you give it time," he said. If the bid fails, intense speculation will fall on Nasdaq's intentions for its 30 percent stake, which on average taking into account the foreign exchange hedge on its investment and the LSE's share buyback cost the U.S. company around 1,100p per share. "There is a reasonable probability that Nasdaq could sell its interest to strategic investors looking to accumulate a position in the LSE," analysts at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods said. Customers and investors around the world are applying increasing pressure on exchanges to consolidate, diversify services and reduce fees.
