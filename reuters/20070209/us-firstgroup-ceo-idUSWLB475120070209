 LONDON  (Reuters) - Britain's biggest bus company FirstGroup Plc ( FGP.L ) sees no competition issues or problems from unions in its $3.6 billion deal to buy U.S. firm Laidlaw International Inc. LI.N, its Chief Executive said on Friday. 


 Moir Lockhead, Chief Executive of FirstGroup, told reporters: "It's a massive market and it's massively competitive. We get on very well with the trade unions here and in the United States, and I don't expect any problems." FirstGroup said on Friday it would pay $35.25 for each share in Laidlaw, the U.S. operator of iconic intercity Greyhound buses. "I don't see any job reductions out in the field, and we'll probably need more as we aim to expand," said Lockhead.
