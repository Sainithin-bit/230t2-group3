 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. stocks slid on Friday after chip maker Micron Technology Inc. MU.N said it expected weak demand for some of its key products, which punished the shares of semiconductor companies such as Intel Corp ( INTC.O ). 


 Earlier, oil's climb above $60 a barrel had weighed on the market as the price increase revived concern among investors about the impact of higher energy costs on corporations and consumers. Semiconductors had led the Nasdaq higher earlier in the session until Micron said it believes prices for memory chips used in consumer electronics will fall 30 percent to 40 percent this quarter from the last one. That projection sent Micron's stock down 3 percent to $12.51 on the Nasdaq. "The market was looking for a reason to go down and I guess you could point to that. You could even point to oil trading above $60 a barrel," said Angel Mata, managing director of listed equity trading at Stifel Nicolaus Capital Markets in Baltimore. HSBC "obviously had an effect on the psychology of the market here," Mata said. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  was down 58.64 points, or 0.46 percent, at 12,578.75. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  was down 9.62 points, or 0.66 percent, at 1,438.69. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  was down 27.62 points, or 1.11 percent, at 2,461.05. The Philadelphia Stock Exchange's index of semiconductor stocks.SOXX, which includes Micron, fell 1.1 percent, putting it on track for its worst weekly performance since the 5.3 percent drop in the week of January 21. On the Nasdaq, shares of Intel Corp. ( INTC.O ), the world's largest chip maker, fell 1.4 percent to $21.07. Intel ranked among the 10 biggest drags on the Nasdaq 100 .NDX. Some traders said the souring of the mood about semiconductors just added to the already negative tone set on Thursday after two of the top three U.S. subprime mortgage lenders, Britain's HSBC Holdings Plc HBC.N and New Century Financial Corp.NEW.N, issued warnings about bad loans. The hangover from the warnings by HSBC and New Century continued to cloud the market, with Citigroup ( C.N ) falling 2 percent. Citigroup was the most negative influence on the S&P 500 and was among the blue-chip Dow's biggest decliners.. Citigroup's stock was down $1.08 at $53.36 on the New York Stock Exchange. This is shaping up as Citigroup's worst week since its 3 percent slide in the week of July 16. Shares of International Business Machines Corp. ( IBM.N ) fell 1.2 percent to $98.39 and topped the list of the Dow's biggest losers, followed by shares of The Walt Disney Co. ( DIS.N ), down 3.1 percent at $34.19. On Wednesday, Disney said its first-quarter net earnings more than doubled. U.S. crude oil futures for March delivery CLH7 rose 18 cents to settle at $59.89 a barrel, below its session high at $60.80 on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
