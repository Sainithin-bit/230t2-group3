 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Struggling apparel retailer Gap Inc. ( GPS.N ) said on Thursday that for the first time in a year its monthly sales did not decline, and nudged up its outlook, sparking the stock to jump as much as 4.4 percent. 


 The world's largest clothing retailer, whose chief executive resigned last month, said markdowns helped Gap clear out holiday merchandise in January. It also boosted its fiscal 2006 earnings outlook to 89 cents to 91 cents per share from its previously forecast in a range of 83 to 87 cents a share. Gap, which operates more than 3,000 stores throughout the world, said January same-store sales broke even. In the past year, same-store sales have risen only once -- a surprise 1 percent gain in January 2006, helped by demand for spring merchandise. And it was also only the second time since January 2004 that monthly sales did not fall. But the fact that markdowns drove sales reinforced the company's problems, said CL King & Associates retail analyst Mark Montagna. "People wait for sale time and come in droves because stuff is marked down so low, which reflects the issue of better full price selling," he said. Selling full-priced merchandise is essential, but that is not expected to happen for a while. The company, which is reviewing options for its Gap and Old Navy brands, may not have time to replace poor-selling merchandise it might already be putting out, Montagna added. Spring merchandise will be in stores within the next two weeks, the company said in a call. TURNAROUND? The company has seen customers lured away by trendier retailers like Abercrombie & Fitch Co. ( ANF.N ) and discount and mid-priced department stores like Target Corp. ( TGT.N ) and Kohl's Corp. ( KSS.N ). Analysts said Gap has failed to understand its audience and has either offered uninspiring apparel that can be purchased elsewhere more cheaply, or has experimented with too-trendy styles that don't appeal to Gap's 20- to 30-year-old shoppers. "Management must offer compelling merchandise that inspires the customer to buy at these stores," said Stifel Nicholas analyst Richard Jaffe, who has a "hold" rating on shares. Early last month, Gap said it was reviewing brand strategies at Gap and Old Navy. The company said Thursday that Charlotte Neuville, head designer for its Gap North America division, will leave the company. It will launch an external search to replace Neuville. That could be a step toward reviewing strategic options for the ailing brand, and could also mean a new take on its designs, Montagna said. The retailer also promoted Tom Wyatt, the head of GapBody, to the additional role of president of Gap Inc. Outlet. The company, which also runs the more upscale Banana Republic chain and family-oriented Old Navy chain, posted total sales of $955 million for the four weeks ended January 28, and $1.2 billion for the five weeks ended February 3. Overall merchandise margins in January declined significantly, driven by sales at its Gap and Old Navy stores the company said. Same-store sales fell 6 percent at the Gap chain, was off 1 percent at Old Navy, and rose 14 percent at Banana Republic. Analysts, on average, expected Gap to post a same-stores sales decrease of 8 percent, according to a Reuters survey. CEO Paul Pressler left Gap last month after pressure increased to turn around lackluster sales. Pressler's resignation has quelled Wall Street speculation at least temporarily that the company would be sold to private equity. Gap shares ended up 50 cents, or 2.6 percent, at $19.75 on the New York Stock Exchange after trading as high as $20.10.
