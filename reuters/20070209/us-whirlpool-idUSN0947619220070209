 ORLANDO, Florida  (Reuters) - Whirlpool Corp. ( WHR.N ) is hoping that it will be able to expand its business with retailers such as Best Buy Co. ( BBY.N ), as it introduces new Maytag appliances, the company's North America president said on Friday. 


 "We would love to have our product be showcased in every retailer," David Swift said. "We think that with what we're bringing with innovation and the revitalized Maytag brand that we will earn that." Best Buy stopped selling Maytag washers and refrigerators in 2005, citing a consumer preference for other products such as high-tech appliances from South Korea's LG Electronics Inc.  ( 066570.KS ). Swift said that Best Buy "serves a very unique segment in the market. We're very eager and anxious to have them carry even more of our products and are hopeful that the Maytag family will be a key part of that." Best Buy, one of the four biggest U.S. appliance retailers, still sells Whirlpool, Electrolux AB ( ELUXb.ST ) and other brands. Swift also said in a telephone interview that the world's largest appliance maker would likely continue to raise prices on its goods until material costs start to fall. "For us to be competitive and be able to deliver returns that allow us to fund our strategies, we have to take cost-based price increases," Swift said from Benton Harbor, Mich., where Whirlpool is based. "That's going to continue to have to be the way we operate until hopefully at some point we begin to see some moderation in these material costs," he added. On Wednesday, Whirlpool posted a drop in fourth-quarter profit and cut its profit forecast for the current year, saying higher costs of nickel, copper and zinc and lower U.S. demand for appliances would weigh on results. Whirlpool told analysts at that time that it would raise prices globally to cope with the higher costs. At the International Builders' Show in Orlando, which runs through Saturday, Whirlpool displayed a new top-loading Maytag washing machine that will be sold later this year. Called the Centennial in recognition of the Maytag washing machine's 100th anniversary, the washer has the traditional top-load square shape with commercial features such as a stainless steel basket. Whirlpool acquired Maytag in March 2006. Maytag, which built a reputation for durability, struggled with high fixed costs in recent years and wasn't able to invest in product development. Whirlpool shares closed down 51 cents to $89.99 in New York Stock Exchange trading.
