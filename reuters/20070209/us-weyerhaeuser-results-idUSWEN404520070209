 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. forest products company Weyerhaeuser Co. ( WY.N ) posted a quarterly profit on Friday, versus a year-earlier loss, helped by a refund of duties and an increased profit from its real estate business. 


 "Dramatically stronger than expected real estate results provided the majority of the upside and better than expected timberland results and lower taxes helped also." said Credit Suisse Analyst Mark Connelly, in a research note. Net income in the fourth quarter totaled $450 million, or $1.88 a share, compared with a year-earlier loss of $211 million or 86 cents a share, when results were hurt by charges related to the closing of some paper and lumber facilities. According to analysts, excluding items the company posted earnings of 95 cents a share, well above Wall Street expectations for 75 cents a share. Weyerhaeuser's net earnings in the 2006 quarter benefited from a gain of $227 million, or 95 cents a share, related to the refund of duties on Canadian lumber sold in the United States. The United States and Canada last year arrived at an agreement to refund $4.3 billion of duties to Canadian wood exporters that ended a long-running trade dispute between lumber companies in both countries. The agreement also required the United States to halt import duties it for years had claimed were needed to offset what it called Canada's unfair state support of its lumber industry. Fourth-quarter net sales were $5.66 billion, compared with net sales of $5.71 billion a year ago. Analysts, on average, had forecast sales of $5.39 billion. The company's real estate business posted pretax earnings of $293 million, compared with a profit of $250 million a year before. SLUGGISH OUTLOOK Weyerhaeuser said it expects first-quarter real estate earnings to decline significantly from the fourth quarter's and it does not expect any significant land sale transactions in the quarter. On a sequential basis, the company also expects weaker profits in the first quarter from its timberlands business and its containerboard and packaging unit. In a statement, Steven Rogel, the company's chairman and chief executive said the company has yet to complete its restructuring process and it may take several quarters to see the full benefit of the restructuring efforts. In August last year, Weyerhaeuser agreed to merge its fine paper business with Canada's Domtar Inc. DTC.N DTC.TO in a deal worth $3.3 billion. The split-off, which is due to close in March this year, is a part of Weyerhaeuser's broader restructuring plan. The company plans to focus on its containerboard, real estate and timber businesses. Weyerhaeuser has been reducing production amid a U.S. housing downturn and has shut down and curtailed operations at several of its operations because of weak demand for wood. Slowing demand for new housing in domestic markets has hurt companies in several industries, including homebuilders, polyvinyl chloride makers and mortgage lenders. Shares of the Federal Way, Washington-based company have soared 22 percent in the last three months, outpacing and buoying the Standard and Poor's Paper and Forest Products Index .GSPAFP which has risen about 14 percent during the same period. Weyerhaeuser's shares were down 40 cents at $78.59 in afternoon trade on the New York Stock Exchange.
