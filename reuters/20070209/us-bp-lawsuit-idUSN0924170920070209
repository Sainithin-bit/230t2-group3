 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Two pension funds plan to ask an Alaska state court on Friday to freeze more than $140 million in retirement pay and other compensation for outgoing BP Plc ( BP.L )( BP.N ) CEO John Browne, saying it is excessive and undeserved, an attorney for the investors said. 


 The expected court action, a draft of which was given to Reuters, comes as investors are becoming increasingly vocal over what they see as runaway pay for chief executives but also amid growing opposition from British business to what it sees as extraterritorial application of U.S. laws. In the case of BP, the shareholder plaintiffs want Browne's pension fund to be held in a court-supervised trust while they pursue claims against him and the board of directors for environmental and worker safety issues that have beset the oil company. "Browne is now, it appears, being pushed out of the company but taking with him upward of God knows how many millions and millions of dollars of severance and pension payments," said William Lerach, a prominent U.S. class-action lawyer who represents the pension plan of U.S. union group Unite Here and the London Pensions Fund Authority in the case. "We don't think he should be able to walk away with that kind of money," Lerach said. He said the BP board could withhold the pension payouts from Browne if it found that the CEO performed negligently. A BP spokesman said the company does not comment on legal matters or court actions. The motion is expected to be filed in state court in Anchorage on Friday, Lerach said. London-based BP has major petroleum operations in Alaska. STEPPING DOWN EARLY Browne announced on January 12 that he would step down at the end of July, 17 months earlier than planned, after a failed attempt to extend his tenure was opposed by the chairman, leading to uncertainty at the top of the third biggest Western oil company. For many years Browne was often voted one of the world's most respected executives in business surveys but Alaskan oil spills, fatal accidents at U.S. refineries and allegations of fuel market manipulation in the past two years have dented his image. The accusation from U.S. regulators that he put cost-cutting before safety, contributing to an explosion which killed 15 people at a Texas refinery, was a particular blow for a man who had put much effort into establishing green credentials. The pension fund of Unite Here, a union representing apparel, textile, hotel and casino workers, and the London Pensions Fund Authority, one of the largest UK retirement systems for local government workers, sued Browne and the board in October. The lawsuit accused them of reckless conduct in overseeing environmental and labor matters and said their actions harmed shareholders. The new claims, according to estimates compiled by Lerach's law firm, seek to temporarily bar Browne, a lifelong BP employee, from collecting approximately $40 million in pension benefits and $54.5 million in long-term performance pay while the plaintiffs pursue their claims. They also want the court to freeze about $30.7 million in stock options and want about $18.3 million in previously awarded cash bonuses to be returned and put into the trust. Browne was one of the best paid UK executives in recent years but his compensation paled in comparison to CEOs of U.S. rivals such as Exxon Mobil Corp ( XOM.N ) and ConocoPhillips Corp. The plaintiffs also said they want BP to give them a "detailed accounting" of Browne's pay figures so they can calculate the exact amount of his total compensation, according to the draft court papers. PAY CRITICISED. Executive pay, long a contentious issue, has galvanized shareholder activists, their anger stoked by recent disclosures that ex-Home Depot Inc. ( HD.N ) CEO Robert Nardelli and former Pfizer Inc. ( PFE.N ) CEO Hank McKinnell would get exit packages valued at about $200 million apiece. The issue is also a hot topic in Washington, DC, where Democrats are calling for pay reform, while President George W. Bush has said pay for CEOs "should be based on their success at improving their companies." Lerach's firm, Lerach Coughlin Stoia Geller Rudman & Robbins LLP of San Diego, California, and other shareholders' attorneys have had success recently in getting a freeze on the compensation of UnitedHealth Group Inc. ( UNH.N ) former CEO William McGuire. Late last year, a federal judge in Minnesota temporarily blocked McGuire from collecting his company pension or exercising stock options while the health insurer sorts out potential legal claims stemming from a probe into options awards to McGuire and other executives.
