 LONDON  (Reuters) - Britain's FirstGroup Plc ( FGP.L ) said on Friday it was buying U.S. firm Laidlaw International Inc. LI.N, which operates the iconic intercity Greyhound buses, in a $3.6 billion deal. 


 First Group said it had agreed to pay $35.25 for each Laidlaw shares in the recommended deal, which would immediately create $70 million of costs savings a year.
