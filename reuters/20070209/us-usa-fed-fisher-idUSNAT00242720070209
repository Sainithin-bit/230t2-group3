 DALLAS  (Reuters) - Dallas Federal Reserve President Richard Fisher said on Friday he is fairly comfortable with the inflation outlook but would "aggressively" argue for further interest rate increases if inflation does not ebb as expected. 


 "No central banker can ever be smug about containing the risk of inflation, but I am pleased with the current direction of inflationary impulses," Fisher said in a speech to the Rotary Club of the Park Cities. "If (rate) increases are needed, I would aggressively advocate for them. But for now I am as comfortable with the inflationary outlook as a prudent central banker can be," he said. The Fed has kept benchmark interest rates at 5.25 percent at its past five meetings, after last raising rates in June. Financial markets look for steady policy through at least mid-year, and retained that view after Fisher's comments. Fisher is not a voting member of the monetary policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee in 2007. Some Fed officials have fretted recently about potential for rising wage inflation given the low U.S. jobless rate, last pegged in January at 4.6 percent or below common measures of "full employment." Fisher told reporters after the speech the outlook for wage inflation depended on productivity trends and "a global context." He earlier characterized productivity as running lower than expected but still growing, while adding that strong growth in overseas economies could limit the ability of the United States to source cheap inputs and labor. Domestically, the U.S. workforce "has critical shortages in some labor sectors," including in the gas and chemicals industries and even among hospitality workers in some areas. Fisher said he is confident the Fed can accommodate a growth rate that can bring core inflation back down below 2 percent as offsetting forces affecting prices are balanced. "I will rest a heck of a lot easier when we get the core rate down well below 2 percent and keep it there," he said. In 2006 the core personal consumption expenditures price index, the Fed's favorite inflation measure, rose by 2.2 percent, above the central bank's comfort zone. Fisher said that his upbeat broad view on the U.S. economy had not changed since his last speech on December 19. Strong fourth quarter U.S. economic growth of 3.5 percent is likely to be revised down to about 3 percent, and 2007 growth could continue at a similar level, he said. "We're absolutely running a very strong economy" and can do so "without stoking inflation," he told reporters. U.S. economic growth in 2006 was capped by the slump in residential housing at the end of a years-long boom. Fisher said that by some measures, such as a now-falling rate of walkaways, or people who abandon a commitment to buy, the housing downturn might be bottoming. Weaker housing is already "one of the most discussed and discounted trends," Fisher said, adding that "aftershocks" are developing in the subprime mortgage lending market and elsewhere. He cited deflationary tailwinds helping the Fed in its goal of tamping down inflation, including the lagged effect of the bank's 17 consecutive rate increases that ended in mid-2006. Moderating energy prices would also help, Fisher said.
