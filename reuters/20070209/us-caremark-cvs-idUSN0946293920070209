 PHILADELPHIA  (Reuters) - Proxy advisory firm Glass Lewis said on Friday it recommended that shareholders of Caremark Rx Inc. CMX.N reject the planned $24 billion takeover by drug-store chain CVS Corp. ( CVS.N ) 


 "We are not convinced that the process used by the company and the board to arrive at this deal resulted in shareholders received as big a stake as they deserve in the proposed, combined entity," Glass Lewis said. "We feel the CVS deal should be rejected on what appears to have been a flawed negotiating process," said Glass Lewis, which suggested that Caremark shareholders urge the board to open the bidding to more parties. Glass Lewis did not comment on Express Scripts Inc.'s ( ESRX.O ) hostile takeover bid for Caremark, which is valued at $26.4 billion. CVS had evaluated other potential partners before forging the deal with Caremark, but Caremark did not conduct a broad search for suitors, the firm said. "We believe a competitive process would have yielded a better offer from CVS, and potentially, from others," Glass Lewis said. "Only when that competitive process is concluded will shareholders know they have received maximum value and optimal strategic partnering." Caremark said it disagreed with the recommendation from Glass Lewis. Caremark said it was confident its shareholder would support the deal with CVS since it could close later this month. Caremark's shareholders vote on the CVS deal on February 20. CVS shareholders vote on February 23. CVS declined to comment. Express Scripts were not immediately available to comment. Shares of Caremark traded at $61.42 per share -- which is higher than the offers from both CVS and Express Scripts -- as investors expected the suitors to raise their bids, traders said. The bid from CVS is currently valued at $55.08 per share, plus a $2 per share dividend. The Express Scripts bid is currently valued at $60.52 per share. The Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will hold a hearing on February 16 on Express Scripts' lawsuit to void a $675 million breakup fee in the Caremark-CVS pact. The Court must decide whether the CVS-Caremark merger agreement included onerous provisions that prevented the Caremark board from considering other offers.
