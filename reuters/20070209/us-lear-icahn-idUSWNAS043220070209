 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Auto parts maker Lear Corp. ( LEA.N ) said on Friday it accepted a $2.31 billion buyout offer from billionaire investor Carl Icahn, the latest in big private equity deals in the troubled U.S. auto parts sector. 


 The $36-per-share offer for the shares that Icahn does not already own allows Lear to solicit alternate proposals for 45 days and the company's shares continued to trade above that level on Friday, indicating that Lear might command a higher price ultimately. However, analysts were uncertain Lear would attract much interest given the short window, Lear's support for the Icahn offer and the relatively few auto parts companies that have the strength and a similar focus to find it attractive. Icahn is Lear's largest shareholder and an associate sits on Lear's board. He made the offer a week ago and Lear accepted that bid despite a run-up in the stock to above $40 this week. Lear shares were down 72 cents or 1.8 percent at $39.34 in late Friday afternoon New York Stock Exchange trade. Pzena Investment Management LLC, one of Lear's largest shareholders, said it was disappointed by the decision. It plans to vote against the deal and hopes others will follow its lead, founder and Co-Chief Investment Officer Richard Pzena said in a telephone interview. "There certainly was no financial, strategic or operational reason to do this at an inadequate price," Pzena said. "We are going to be pushing them as hard as we possibly can to actually use that 45-day period and actively solicit other offers." Icahn already holds a stake of nearly 16 percent in Lear, or close to 12 million of the 76.3 million shares outstanding on February 2. Pzena, which holds more than 6.8 million Lear shares, had said when the offer was disclosed that Lear should be valued at closer to $60 per share. The deal with Icahn-controlled American Real Estate Partners LP ( ACP.N ) includes fees of up to $100 million should Lear accept a superior proposal, which could further discourage other bidders from getting into the game. Southfield, Michigan-based Lear, which produces auto seats, interiors and electronics, would no longer be publicly traded after the deal. President Douglas DelGrosso would become CEO after the deal, with current Chairman and CEO Robert Rossiter serving initially as executive chairman. UNDER PRESSURE The Icahn announcement follows private equity deals in the sector covering bankrupt Delphi Corp.'s DPHIQ.PK emergence plan and business unit sales and a recent ArvinMeritor Inc. ARM.N plan to sell an emissions unit. Lear reported a net loss of $707.5 million for 2006, pressured by production cuts on key sport-utility vehicles and pickup trucks at the U.S.-based automakers. It has been cutting plants and jobs and is selling a money-losing interiors unit. "Given the hurdle of a break-up fee, and the already full valuation of the offer, we believe it is unlikely that another bidder, strategic or financial, will enter the fray," Merrill Lynch analyst John Murphy said in a note. CRT Capital Group LLC senior vice president Kirk Ludtke also doubted another bidder would emerge, given management's support for the deal and the relatively few companies that have the financial muscle or the similar business focus for such a buy. Morningstar analyst John Novak said Icahn's price was a bit low, given potential for upside in 2008 and 2009, but making a competing bid would be difficult. The Icahn deal is worth $5.3 billion including assumed debt. The parties expect it to close by the end of the second quarter, subject to stockholder approval. The deal carries its share of industry risks as well, analysts cautioned. Fitch Ratings managing director Mark Oline said Lear faces production cuts by customers, high commodity costs, an ongoing restructuring, competition from international rivals that could take business and a high debt load. "We had projected only modest improvement in the balance sheet over the next year or so, and certainly a much higher debt burden than is anticipated in this transaction will be a challenge for them," Oline said. Lear sold its European interiors operations to financier Wilbur Ross' International Automotive Components Group joint venture in 2006 and expects to complete the sale of its North American interiors unit to Ross's group in the first quarter. Lear took a stake in the Ross group in exchange for the interiors unit and will focus on seating and electronics. It expects 2007 revenue of about $15 billion excluding interiors.
