 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Hasbro Inc. HAS.N, the second largest U.S. toy maker, reported a 15 percent rise in fourth-quarter profit on Friday, helped by strong sales of Nerf balls and Monopoly board games. 


 But Hasbro's shares fell 2.54 percent to close at $28.38 with investors likely spooked by the company's pricey valuation and its uninspiring forecast for Marvel Entertainment Inc. MVL.N toys like Spiderman and Fantastic Four, said Gerrick Johnson, an analyst with BMO Capital Markets. Hasbro is adding more toys this year because of its licensing deal with Marvel Entertainment. The company said toys related to films like "Spiderman 3" and "Fantastic Four: Rise of Silver Surfer" would be just as profitable as its other brands. "Why would you take on all this risk if it's only going to be as profitable as everything else you've done? The stock has rallied to where it is based on the toys for these movies," Johnson said." Hasbro's Transformers brand is also tied to a summer movie due to be released July 4. Hasbro finished 2006 on a strong note as its Playskool and Transformers toys sold well during a holiday season that was kind to most major toy makers. U.S. toy makers saw $10.6 billion in sales during the holidays, which allowed them to post a slim gain in total sales for the year. Hasbro said its fourth-quarter net income increased to $108.3 million, or 62 cents a share, from $94.3 million, or 48 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding special items, profit was 74 cents a share. On that basis, analysts on average were expecting 67 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue rose 4.1 percent to $1.1 billion, boosted by a 10 percent increase at the North American division, which includes brands like Littlest Pet Shop and Clue. "So many things contributed to growth," said Wedbush Morgan Securities analyst Sean McGowan, who has a "buy" rating on Hasbro shares, "It's like one hot product got replaced by 10 ... It's hard to find any weakness right now." According to market research firm NPD Group, licensed products from movies can generate up to 25 percent of total U.S. toy sales in any given year. Hasbro's stock, which has climbed about 67 percent since hitting a 52-week low of $17.38 in July, trades at a multiple of 22.75 times estimated 2007 earnings, a premium to No. 1 U.S. toy maker Mattel Inc. MAT.N, which trades at a multiple of 17.64. Hasbro's results come a week after Mattel posted a quarterly profit that surpassed Wall Street estimates on strong holiday sales of its T.M.X Elmo and Barbie lines.
