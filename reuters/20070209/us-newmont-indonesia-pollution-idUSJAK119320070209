 JAKARTA  (Reuters) - An Indonesian court hearing due on Friday for a high-profile pollution trial involving U.S. firm Newmont Mining Corp. ( NEM.N ) has been postponed for two weeks, officials said. 


 A Newmont unit operating in Indonesia's North Sulawesi province and its president director, Richard Ness, face charges over allegations the miner dumped toxic substances near its now defunct gold mine, making villagers sick. The prosecution's counterplea to legal arguments delivered by the unit and Ness in January has been delayed as prosecutors needed more time for preparation, officials told Reuters. "The judges gave us two weeks to draw up the counterplea, but it's not enough so we have asked for another two weeks," Purwanta, a member of the prosecution team, told Reuters. The pollution trial against Newmont, which began in August 2005, will resume on February 23. Maxi Sigarlaki, spokesman of the Manado court, said the prosecutors asked for more time to prepare the counterplea because it had to be approved by the attorney general's office in Jakarta. "We accept the delay because aside from being discussed in Manado, the counterplea must be approved by the attorney general," Sigarlaki said. Ness and his firm in their legal arguments in January said they had obtained valid licenses to carry out mining activities, including a license for the disposal of tailings to the Buyat bay seabed and an environmental impact analysis by the environment ministry. Ness asked to be acquitted of all charges as the prosecutors did not provide sufficient evidence to support pollution charges against him. In November, the prosecutor asked for a three-year jail term for Ness over allegations he failed to stop the firm from polluting the environment and demanded he pay 500 million rupiah ($55,250) or serve an additional six months in prison. The prosecutor also demanded the firm be fined 1 billion rupiah. Under Indonesian law, a prosecution sentencing demand serves as a strong recommendation for the court. But judges have the right to ignore the advice when considering their verdict. Newmont opened the North Sulawesi gold mine in 1996 and closed the site after the last ore was processed in August 2004. The company also operates Asia's second-largest copper mine, Batu Hijau, on eastern Sumbawa island, which produced 718 million pounds of copper and 719,000 ounces of gold last year.
