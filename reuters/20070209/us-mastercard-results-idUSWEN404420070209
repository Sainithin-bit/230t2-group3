 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - MasterCard Inc. ( MA.N ) reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter profit on Friday as spending volume jumped, but the credit card company warned that operating margin growth may slow this year, and its shares fell 10 percent. 


 MasterCard, which processes credit card payments for merchants, also raised its quarterly dividend by 66.7 percent to 15 cents a share. But a company official said on a conference call that the nearly 3 percentage point improvement in 2006 operating margins could be difficult to match in 2007, spurring heavy selling in the shares. "If we can do better, we will, but we continue to have a 1 to 2 percent long-term target for annual margin improvement," Chief Executive Bob Selander told Reuters in an interview. MasterCard shares were down $11.51 at $103.23 in midday New York Stock Exchange trade. At Thursday's close, the shares had nearly tripled in price since the company went public in May at $39 a share. Even after Friday's decline, the shares were still trading at 27 times estimated 2007 earnings. Many of MasterCard's peers trade at multiples of about 20, according to analyst Joseph Dickerson of Atlantic Equities in London. "I think MasterCard's valuation does not reflect reality," he said. One boon to fourth-quarter earnings was an 8.5 percent decline in advertising and marketing expenses. The company said its marketing spending was higher than usual in the months leading up to the World Cup soccer tournament in June and July, and lower than usual in the second half of the year. RESULTS TROUNCE ESTIMATES Fourth-quarter profit totaled $40.9 million, or 30 cents a share, compared with a year-earlier loss of $52.9 million, or 39 cents a share. Excluding the impact of litigation settlements, profit was 31 cents a share. On that basis, analysts polled by Reuters Estimates had forecast, on average, 15 cents a share. Revenue rose 17 percent to $839 million. The number of transactions processed rose 17.5 percent to 4.4 billion, and the dollar volume rose 13.8 percent to $532 billion on a local currency basis. "The key was, volumes were very strong," said analyst Sanjay Sakhrani of Keefe, Bruyette & Woods in New York. Advertising and marketing expenses fell 8.5 percent to $352.9 million. Higher legal fees helped lift general and administrative expenses by 6.4 percent to $399.3 million. In December MasterCard won federal court approval to retain its sponsorship of the World Cup from 2007 to 2014, after soccer's governing body, FIFA, tried to switch to Visa International. Another key lawsuit for MasterCard was resolved during the fourth quarter when a judge approved a $336 million settlement of a lawsuit accusing MasterCard, Visa and others of colluding to fix amounts charged to convert transactions from one currency to another. The defendants were accused of also failing to properly disclose costs. After going public in May, shares of Purchase, New York-based MasterCard rose 152 percent through December 29, while the Dow Jones U.S. Financials index rose 14 percent.
