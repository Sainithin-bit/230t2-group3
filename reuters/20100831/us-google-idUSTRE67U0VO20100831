 BANGALORE  (Reuters) - Google is set to unveil a new feature to its Gmail service that aims to separate a user's important emails from the ones that do not get read often. 

 The new feature called "Priority Inbox" will help users focus on messages that matter without having to set up complex rules, Google said in its official blog. The Priority Inbox application splits the inbox into three sections: 'Important and unread', 'Starred' and 'Everything Else'. "As messages come in, Gmail automatically flags some of them as important. Gmail uses a variety of signals to predict which messages are important, including the people you email most and which messages you open and reply to," the company said. Google said Priority Inbox will roll out to all Gmail users, including those who use Google Apps, over the next week. (Reporting by  Sakthi Prasad  in Bangalore; Editing by  Michael Shields  )
