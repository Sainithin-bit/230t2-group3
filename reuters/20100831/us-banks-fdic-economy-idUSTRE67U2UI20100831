 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. bank regulator Sheila Bair said on Tuesday that she does not anticipate a double-dip recession in the United States. 

 "I think it's something we're watching very closely, and we don't see it happening," Bair, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp, said during a quarterly briefing. (Reporting by  Karey Wutkowski  and  Dave Clarke , editing by Gerald E. McCormick)
