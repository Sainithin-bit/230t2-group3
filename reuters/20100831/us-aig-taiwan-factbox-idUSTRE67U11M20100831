 (Reuters) - Taiwan's regulators rejected American International Group's sale of its Taiwan unit Nan Shan Life to China Strategic and Hong Kong investment firm Primus some 10 months after it was first agreed. 

 Following are some facts about Nan Shan and the bid interest it attracted. -- Nan Shan is Taiwan's No.3 life insurer by market share, behind the life insurance units of financial holding firms Cathay Financial and Fubon Financial. -- Founded in 1963, Nan Shan has 4 million policyholders, or about one-sixth of Taiwan's 23 million population. Its assets reached T$1.7 trillion ($53 billion) as of June. -- AIG put Nan Shan up for sale in 2009 after it was bailed out by the U.S. government. -- Four groups bid for the unit: China Strategic and Primus; Taiwanese bank Chinatrust Financial; Fubon and private equity firm Carlyle; Cathay Financial. -- Chinatrust put in the highest bid in cash terms at some $2.4 billion over China Strategic's $2.15 billion, but lost out after not agreeing to some of the conditions imposed on a buyer. -- The deal with battery maker China Strategic sparked protests in Taiwan from politicians and unions over the buyer's political connections with mainland China and its lack of experience running an insurance business. The opposition delayed the regulatory process.
