 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Former Hewlett-Packard Co ( HPQ.N ) Chief Executive Mark Hurd was not nominated for re-election as a director of News Corp ( NWSA.O ), according to a regulatory filing on Tuesday. 

 Hurd will remain on News Corp's board until the media company's next annual meeting on October 15, according to the filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. "News Corp is a great company and I appreciate the chance to serve on its board of directors," Hurd said in a statement. "I have decided to move on and focus on future career opportunities." Hurd resigned as chairman and chief executive of HP on August 6 after an internal investigation found that he had falsified expense reports to conceal a relationship with a female contractor. "After discussions between the company and Mark Hurd, it was determined that he would not be considered for re-election," News Corp said in a statement. News Corp, which owns The Wall Street Journal, Fox Network and Twentieth Century Fox Studios, did not elaborate. (Reporting by  Yinka Adegoke  and  Jennifer Saba ; Editing by Gerald E.
