 HELSINKI  (Reuters) - Nokia Oyj has started deliveries of its first touch-screen phone, the 5800, the cell phone maker's answer to Apple Inc's iPhone. 

 Nokia said on Thursday the phone is, or soon will be, available in selected markets globally, including Russia, Spain, India, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Finland. Nokia said last month the model will cost 279 euros ($360) before operator subsidies and taxes, substantially less than the iPhone. Spurred by Apple, LG Electronics and Samsung Electronics have already rolled out touch-screen phones over the last two years, mostly in developed markets.
