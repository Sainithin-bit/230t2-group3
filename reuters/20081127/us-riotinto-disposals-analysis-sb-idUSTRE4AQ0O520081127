 SINGAPORE  (Reuters) - Rio Tinto ( RIO.AX ), the world's No.2 miner, may have to sell more assets than it bargained for as it tackles nearly $40 billion of debt that scared off a takeover bid by bigger rival BHP Billiton ( BHP.AX ) ( BLT.L ). 

 Rio ( RIO.L ) took on huge debts to fund last year's $38 billion acquisition of Alcan, and pledged to raise $15 billion, most of it this year, from selling non-core assets. But sliding metals prices and slowing demand have made those assets worth less, and the global financial crisis has made it tougher for potential buyers to get credit. To date, Rio has raised just $3 billion from disposals. Analysts say Rio might have to go beyond those non-core businesses and offer up more prized assets if it wants to avoid having to go cap in hand to investors for more equity or having to cut planned spending or dividends. And BHP could be a bargain buyer. "The non-core -- the salt, borates, talc and packaging assets -- are up for grabs, but in this market I doubt very much that they are worth $15 billion," said a resource equities analyst in Melbourne, asking not to be identified. "I'm not factoring in any asset disposals. It's impossible to say whether they will even get book value." Rio spokesman Nick Cobban said: "We have raised $3 billion, but we recognize the change in global economic circumstances and we won't reach the $10 billion target this year. We have not put a date on (hitting) that target. "The sale processes continue, but we won't make any announcements until they are completed." BHP's shock decision to walk away from its $66 billion offer for Rio knocked more than a fifth off Rio's market value in Australian trading on Wednesday, and prompted rating agency Moody's to signal a possible Rio credit downgrade. On Thursday Rio pared its losses slightly, rising 2 percent in Sydney. BHP shares, which rose nearly 4 percent on Wednesday, added another 5.7 percent. RISING INTEREST Rio Tinto is currently paying a little more than 2 percent interest on its debt pile, but analysts said that could rise sharply in the next round of refinancing in the 2009 fourth quarter as lenders re-price risk amid a global credit crisis. "They will have to divest far more quickly than they may have liked and BHP might be there to snap up some of those assets," said Andrew Harrington, coal analyst at Patterson Securities in Sydney. He said BHP has around A$8.5 billion ($5.47 billion) in cash and current assets, and end-June debts of around A$12 billion. Harrington noted Rio owns 75 percent of Australia-listed Coal and Allied CNA.AX, and a sale of that stake could net around A$8-10 billion, including a takeover premium. "The question remains: who would want to spring for their thermal coal assets? Credit markets are tight so you'd need pretty deep pockets, which makes me think BHP may now be thinking about buying choice pieces of Rio without having to acquire all the stuff they don't want." Other bidders for Rio assets may include private equity firms Apollo Global Management and Bain Capital, as well as Australian packaging group Amcor Ltd ( AMC.AX ) and U.S. packager Bemis Co ( BMS.N ) -- attracted by the flexible food packaging business, one of the largest in the world, though its size could make it hard to raise funding in the current climate. BHP Billiton chief Marius Kloppers did not rule out making a pitch for Rio assets at its Australian annual general meeting. In response a question whether BHP would be interested in any Rio Tinto assets if they came up for sale, Kloppers said: "If opportunities come up...we would be very interested in looking at any assets that are tier 1, low cost, long life, environmentally sound and so on," Kloppers told reporters after the meeting. The Rio spokesman said the company was focused on selling the assets it had already flagged and had no immediate comment on whether it was considering other sales. "Rio may need to look at new asset sales initiatives. They'll need to balance those sales against equity or debt funding next year," said FW Holst analyst Rob Craigie, noting, however, that the next 6-12 months would not be an easy time to sell. Rio may avoid having to sell off more of the family silver -- if commodity markets pick up after prices slumped by half in the last five months. Rio is looking for a recovery in the second quarter in China, and increased demand for its raw materials. The Rio spokesman said the company was in a strong position financially. "We don't see any reason to raise more equity. We have strong cashflow and we are disposing of some good businesses. We have no payments due until next October." He said Rio generated cashflow of $1.5 billion a month in the first half of this year and noted many of its sales contracts were locked in until April. Rio has around $9 billion of debt due to be repaid next October. "From the Rio point of view, you're still dealing with a company with A-grade assets," said Tim Schroeders, portfolio manager at Pengana Capital. "Yes, there's a focus on their debt position, but their interest cover is very adequate." (Additional reporting by  Sonali Paul  in Melbourne, Editing by Ian Geoghegan)
