 SEOUL  (Reuters) - South Korean handset and electronics maker LG Electronics ( 066570.KS ) said that it had no plan to acquire GE's ( GE.N ) home appliance unit, ending months of speculation it could be one of the main suitors for the business. 

 "After reviewing possible impacts on our company, we have no plan to take over GE's unit now," LG Electronics said on Thursday in a regulatory filing. (Reporting by Seo Eun-kyung; Editing by  Jonathan Hopfner )
