 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A liquidity crisis has placed Bear Stearns Co in peril, prompting the Federal Reserve and JPMorgan Chase to come to the rescue with emergency financing. 

 JPMorgan's role in the rescue, and Bear Stearns' $3.2 billion loss in market value on Friday alone, has some investors looking for a takeover by JPMorgan. The following is snapshot of the two companies: Bear Stearns -- 2007 Net Income: $233 million -- Assets: $395.362 billion -- Employees: 14,153 -- Market Capitalization: $3.50 billion -- Recorded fourth-quarter write-downs: $1.9 billion JP Morgan Chase -- 2007 Net Income: $15.365 billion -- Assets: $1.562 trillion -- Employees: 180,667 -- Market Capitalization: $124.1 billion -- Recorded fourth-quarter write-downs: $1.3 billion (Reporting by  Steven Bertoni ; Editing by Leslie Adler)
