 LONDON  (Reuters) - The Barclays ( BARC.L ) non-executive director responsible for former chief executive Bob Diamond's controversial 17 million pound ($26.40 million) pay package resigned for personal reasons on Wednesday. 
 The departure of City veteran Alison Carnwath, who headed the bank's remuneration committee, is a further blow to Barclays, which has already lost Diamond and Chief Operating Officer Jerry Del Missier in the fallout from the Libor interest-rate rigging scandal. Carnwath was criticized by investors earlier this year for her role on the remuneration committees at Barclays and hedge fund Man Group ( EMG.L ), where shareholders revolted over pay plans for executives. A fifth of Barclays' investors voted against her re-election after she backed Diamond's pay and almost one-third of Man Group shareholders failed to back her. "With regret I have concluded that I am no longer able to devote sufficient time to my role as a director of Barclays given my other commitments," Carnwath, a 20-year veteran of investment banking, said in a statement on Wednesday. The 59-year-old is one of the highest-profile women in London's financial community. She is chairman of Land Securities ( LAND.L ) and a director of Zurich Insurance Group ( ZURN.VX ) and Paccar ( PCAR.O ). She was also the first female director of J Henry Schroder Wagg & Co, the investment banking division of Schroders. A Land Securities spokesman said: "We're very happy that she continues to be our chairman." (Reporting by Matt Scuffham;Editing by Erica Billingham)
