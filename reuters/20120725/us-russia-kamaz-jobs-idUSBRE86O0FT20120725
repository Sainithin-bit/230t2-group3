 MOSCOW  (Reuters) - Russian truckmaker Kamaz ( KMAZ.MM ) plans to cut between 1,500 and 3,000 so-called white-collar workers to increase its business efficiency, Kamaz's spokesman Oleg Afanasyev told Reuters on Wednesday. 
 "Our figures do not match international standards of 9 to 11 percent of people working in offices (out of the total number of employees) as Kamaz now has 17 percent," he said. Kamaz, where German truckmaker Daimler ( DAIGn.DE ) has a minority stake, employs around 50,000 people in total. The group swung to a net profit of 1.8 billion roubles ($55 million) in 2011 after a 889 million rouble net loss in the previous year.
