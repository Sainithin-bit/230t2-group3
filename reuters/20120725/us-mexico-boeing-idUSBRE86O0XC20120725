 MEXICO CITY  (Reuters) - Mexico's largest airline Aeromexico on Wednesday placed an $11 billion order with Boeing ( BA.N ), in what the company said was the biggest aircraft investment by a Mexican airline in the country's history. 
 The order is for 90 737-8 planes and 10 Dreamliners, Aeromexico ( AEROMEX.MX ) said in a statement. Aeromexico, which went public last year, said the Dreamliners will begin arriving in the summer of 2013 and the 737-8 aircraft will be delivered starting in 2018. Delta Air Lines ( DAL.N ) in June bought a 4 percent stake in Aeromexico for $65 million. Aeromexico increased its market share after rival Mexicana ceased operations before filing for bankruptcy in 2010. The Mexican airline's shares were unchanged in early morning trading. Boeing, which posted better-than-expected results on Wednesday, is on track to overtake rival Airbus ( EAD.PA ) in plane deliveries this year.
