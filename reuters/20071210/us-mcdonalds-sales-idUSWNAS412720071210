 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - McDonald's Corp ( MCD.N ), the world's largest fast-food company, said on Monday sales at restaurants open at least 13 months rose 8.2 percent in November, helped by double-digit increases in Europe and Asia. 

 Same-store sales, a key retail measure, rose 4.4 percent in the United States, 10.8 percent in Europe, and 12 percent in the company's Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa unit. (Reporting by  Brad Dorfman ; Editing by John Wallace)
