 ZURICH  (Reuters) - Swiss bank UBS ( UBSN.VX ) is well positioned to cope with further market difficulties after it recapitalized the bank with an injection of capital from a Singaporean government entity and a Middle East investor, UBS chairman said. 

 Marcel Ospel made the comment during a media conference call. UBS earlier unveiled $10 billion in shock subprime writedowns on Monday and said it had obtained an emergency capital injection from a Singapore government entity -- The Government of Singapore Investment Corporation -- and an unnamed Middle East investor.
