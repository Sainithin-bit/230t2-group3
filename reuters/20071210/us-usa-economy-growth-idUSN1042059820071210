 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The U.S. economy is expected to grow by an anemic 2.1 percent in 2008 as it works through more deterioration in the housing and credit markets, a key securities industry group forecast on Monday. 

 "Major factors dampening growth are the housing sector deterioration and tight financing conditions," said Michael Decker of the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, as the group released its economic advisory round-table year-end survey. Like consumer spending, growth in business capital spending is expected to be slightly lower than the 2007. But business spending will continue to benefit from generally solid corporate balance sheets and cash balances accumulated during the recent period of strong corporate profits, the survey said. The group said that while the housing spillover to the broader economy has been limited, the housing sector decline is expected to run through most of 2008 or beyond. "Housing prices will be the transmission mechanism to work off the excess housing inventory on the market and bring supply and demand into closer balance," the group said. Actions from the Federal Reserve will help offset troubles from the housing market, the group said. The consensus among the round-table members is for Fed policy-makers to cut the target federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 4.25 percent when they meet on Tuesday.
