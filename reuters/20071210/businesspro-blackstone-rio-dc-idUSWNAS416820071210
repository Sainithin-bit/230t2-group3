 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Private equity firm Blackstone Group 
( BX.N ) on Monday denied speculation that it is planning a 
counterbid for Rio Tinto Ltd/Plc ( RIO.AX ) ( RIO.L ) with a 
consortium believed to include China's sovereign wealth fund. 

  The speculation appeared in the British newspaper The Daily 
Telegraph.  "The Blackstone Group has consulted with the U.K. Takeover 
Panel and told them that there is no truth to this story," 
Blackstone said in a statement.  Blackstone said it is not involved in this transaction in 
either an investment or advisory role.  Rio Tinto has already rejected a proposed $140 billion 
three-for-one share takeover offer by rival miner BHP Billiton 
Ltd/Plc ( BHP.AX ) ( BLT.L ).  (Reporting by  Mark McSherry , editing by Dave Zimmerman)
