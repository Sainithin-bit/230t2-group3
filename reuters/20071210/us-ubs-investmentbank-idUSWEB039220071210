 ZURICH  (Reuters) - The next big question facing UBS after it announced a shock new $10 billion writedown on subprime exposures was how to reposition its investment bank, said UBS chairman Marcel Ospel. 

 Ospel made the comment during a media conference call. UBS earlier unveiled $10 billion in shock subprime writedowns on Monday and said it had obtained an emergency capital injection from a Singapore government entity -- The Government of Singapore Investment Corporation -- and an unnamed Middle East investor. UBS declined during the conference call to disclose the identity of the Middle East investor.
