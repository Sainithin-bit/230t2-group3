 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc ( CCE.N ), the world's largest bottler of Coke drinks, is targeting flat volume growth of carbonated soft drinks in 2008, the company's chief executive said on Monday. 

 "We'd like to think we can manage it to be flat," CEO John Brock said at an industry conference here. Brock said volume in 2007 had been hurt by aggressive price increases meant to offset rising raw material costs. With input cost inflation moderating, he said Coke Enterprises may be able to ease up on price increases. He said costs for raw materials, such as aluminum for cans and corn syrup for sweetener, would be less in 2008 than in 2007 but still higher than the average over past 25 years.
