 DUBAI  (Reuters) - The $60 billion Qatar Investment 
Authority said on Monday it saw "tremendous opportunities" for 
sovereign wealth funds like itself to invest in U.S. 
financial-services firms battered by a mortgage market crisis. 

  The Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, the world's largest 
sovereign wealth fund, agreed to invest $7.5 billion in 
Citigroup ( C.N ) last month with the U.S. bank facing more than 
$17 billion in second-half writedowns from credit market 
losses.  "There are tremendous opportunities for sovereign wealth 
groups which can react quickly and confidentially," Kenneth 
Chen, head of strategic and private equity at Qatar Investment 
Authority, said on Monday.  "The financial institutions sector should be one that 
investors should be looking at," Shen told reporters in Dubai 
on the sidelines of a private equity conference.  The U.S. property crisis is "the worst in 20 to 25 years," 
Shen said, declining to be more specific about any QIA 
interest. "2008 is going to be an interesting year," he said.  The influence and size of sovereign wealth funds, the top 
20 of which control about $2 trillion of assets, will "continue 
to grow and, perhaps anxiety associated with that will grow as 
well," Shen said.  Those concerns should ease as funds like Abu Dhabi 
Investment Authority buy more into financial institutions like 
Citigroup because they take a long-term view and do not 
necessarily seek control, Shen said. "Control is not 
necessarily a must," he said.  The funds could also partner with private equity firms to 
make acquisitions, Shen said.  (Reporting by James Cordahi) (james.cordahi@reuters.com and
