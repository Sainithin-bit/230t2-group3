 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The cost to insure the debt of MBIA Inc ( MBI.N ) fell after buyout firm Warburg Pincus agreed to invest $1 billion in the bond insurer. 

 Credit default swap spreads on MBIA tightened by around 80 basis points to 340 basis points, or $340,000 per year for five years to insure $10 million in debt, according to broker Phoenix Partners Group. MBIA's swaps have been roiled by concerns the company needs to raise capital to ensure the "AAA" rating of its insurance arm. (Reporting by  Karen Brettell ; Editing by  James Dalgleish )
