 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Bank of America Corp's ( BAC.N ) Columbia asset management unit said on Monday it is closing a privately placed money-market fund for institutional investors. 

 The bank's Columbia Strategic Cash Portfolio fund, which has less than $11 billion in assets, has been closed to new investors, said Columbia spokesman Jon Goldstein. Goldstein denied a CNBC report that the fund had been frozen, saying that clients were being offered the option of cash redemptions or of switching their assets into other Columbia-managed funds.
