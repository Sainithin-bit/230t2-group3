 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co ( 7201.T ) and Daimler AG ( DAIGn.DE ) said on Sunday they would produce Mercedes-Benz gasoline engines at Nissan's Tennessee factory from 2014 to be fitted on Mercedes and Infiniti models. 
 Production capacity of the four-cylinder engines will reach 250,000 a year at full ramp-up, the companies said. The project is the latest between Daimler and the alliance of Nissan and Renault SA ( RENA.PA ), which are exploring ways to share vehicle, engine and other technologies to save development costs and respond faster to market needs. It also marks the first production of Mercedes-Benz engines in North America, where the German automaker is looking to build a stronger manufacturing footprint. The engines will power the luxury brand's C-Class cars built at Daimler's Alabama plant. Nissan's Decherd, Tennessee plant makes four, six and eight-cylinder engines for U.S.-produced Nissan and Infiniti models, and built more than 580,000 engines last year.
