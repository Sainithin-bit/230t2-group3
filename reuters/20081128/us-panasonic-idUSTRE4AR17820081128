 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Shares of Panasonic Corp ( 6752.T ) fell 11 percent on Friday to their lowest level in over five years after it became the latest Japanese electronics maker to slash its profit forecast due to the economic slump. 

 The revision prompted Nomura Securities to lower its rating on Panasonic, the world's No.1 plasma TV maker, to "neutral" from "buy," warning that restructuring could drive profits lower again next business year, starting next April 1. Panasonic cut its net profit forecast for the current business year on Thursday by 90 percent to 30 billion yen ($315 million), its smallest profit in six years and a fraction of the previous market consensus. "Panasonic's earnings forecasts underscored the deteriorating health of the economy," said Terushi Hirotama, head of trading at Ichiyoshi Securities. "Until recently, investors had believed Panasonic could withstand the downturn. But now investors are saying: Panasonic, you too?" Nomura also cut its rating on rival Sony Corp ( 6758.T ) to "neutral" from "buy" to reflect the stronger yen and falling prices of liquid crystal display TVs. Sony shares fell 1.8 percent. Shares of Panasonic closed down 10.9 percent at 1,144 yen, helping to push the sector index .IELEC.T into negative territory, against a 1.7 percent rise in the benchmark Nikkei average  .N225 . Panasonic's shares fell as low as 1,131 yen, their lowest since June 2003. The company lowered its operating profit forecast by 39 percent to 340 billion yen ($3.6 billion) for the year to March and cut its sales outlook by 7.6 percent to 8.5 trillion yen. It said it would book 130 billion yen in additional restructuring costs to consolidate plants and ditch unprofitable businesses, responding to a downturn that has already forced rivals such as Sony to lower their outlooks. Panasonic said it would aim to achieve profit growth in the year starting next April, helped by the restructuring steps. But Nomura predicted that operating profit would fall nearly 20 percent next business year, weighed down by restructuring costs and a stronger yen. Panasonic has pursued a vertically integrated production model, in which a company makes key components in-house and assembles them into finished products to cut costs and gain operational flexibility, instead of buying them from outside. That business model works well when demand is strong and production facilities are highly utilized, but makes it difficult to cut fixed costs in an economic downturn.
