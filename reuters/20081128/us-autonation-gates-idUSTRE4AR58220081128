 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp ( MSFT.O ) co-founder Bill Gates has raised his stake in AutoNation Inc ( AN.N ), the largest U.S. auto dealership group, to nearly 12 percent.

His Cascade Investment LLC owned 10.97 million shares in AutoNation and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Trust holds more than 9.89 million shares after the latest purchases, Gates said.
