 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - The European Central Bank has ample room to cut interest rates further given falling inflation pressure and a sharp deterioration in the economic outlook, ECB Governing Council member Axel Weber said on Wednesday. 

 In a speech prepared for delivery in Berlin, Weber said the German economy -- the largest in the euro zone -- would likely contract again in the fourth quarter and on average in 2009. Meanwhile, inflation in the 15-nation region was set to keep falling on the back of easing energy prices and drop well below the ECB's 2 percent price stability ceiling during 2009. "The receding inflation pressure has created ample room to move for European monetary policy, which will be also used given the rapidly deteriorating economic outlook," he said. Analysts polled by Reuters expect the ECB to cut rates by another 50 basis points at its next meeting on December 4, which would be its third such move since early October and take benchmark credit costs to 2.75 percent. But Weber, who heads the German Bundesbank, also warned that monetary policy should take a symmetrical approach in future, not only cutting rates quickly in the wake of a financial bubble bursting but raising them quickly too to avoid laying the groundwork for future excesses. In Germany, the weaker euro would give exporters an advantage compared to competitors outside the euro zone but this positive impact would only take effect with some time lag. Unemployment would increase again next year, and economic projections would have to be revised down significantly, he said. The German Bundesbank would release updated economic projections on December 5, the day after consolidated projections for the euro zone, "In the meantime, I assume negative growth on average in 2009," Weber said. The German economy shrank in the second and third quarters and the German finance ministry has said a contraction of up to 1 percent is possible for 2009, which would be the weakest performance since the Federal Republic was founded in 1949.
