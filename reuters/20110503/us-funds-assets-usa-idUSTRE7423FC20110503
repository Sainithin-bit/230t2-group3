 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. fund managers slightly lowered their exposure to equities in April and raised their allocation in bonds, booking some profits after a strong rally for stocks, a Reuters poll showed on Tuesday. 

 Based on 15 U.S.-based fund management firms, with total assets under management of about $2.8 trillion, the poll taken between April 13-29 found they held an average of 63.3 percent of their assets in equities from 64.9 percent a month earlier. "This market has run substantially," said Keith Wirtz, chief investment officer at Fifth Third Asset Management, with $18 billion in assets. "Our thought is to de-risk portfolios and move to a neutral weighting in stocks. We're moving into seasonally weak conditions with May and June here, and the macro story may be at risk if oil prices shoot to $130 per barrel or so. There are too many things that can go wrong." U.S. stock markets have been on an upward trajectory despite Japan's devastating earthquake and tsunami in mid-March. Robust corporate earnings, a flood of liquidity from the Federal Reserve and the prospect of ultra-low interest rates for the rest of the year have pushed the Nasdaq to a 10-year high and the Standard & Poor's 500 Index up over 8 percent this year. The Dow Jones industrial average climbed roughly 4 percent in April while the S&P posted returns of 2.85 percent for the same period. Since September 1, the Dow is up nearly 25 percent and the S&P more than 26 percent ahead. "While you could argue that some of the underlying factors remain high and frothy historically, valuations still seem favorable. We have a modestly constructive posture," Dan Peirce, a portfolio manager who works in global asset allocation strategy at State Street Global Advisors, said. April's poll surveyed the same 14 money management firms from the previous month and featured one new participant. BONDS BENEFICIARIES Bond exposure increased to 29 percent in April from 27 percent in March while cash positions held by firms rose to 2.7 percent from 2.5, the poll showed. There has been raging debate over the fate of Treasury prices once the Federal Reserve ends its quantitative easing program in June. Bill Gross, co-chief investment officer of PIMCO, posed the following recently in his widely read monthly report: "Who will buy Treasuries when the Fed doesn't? The question really is, at what yield and what are the price repercussions if the adjustments are significant." Jeffrey Gundlach, DoubleLine's chief executive officer, countered that Treasuries would be in high demand with major holders, as the U.S. economy will "soften substantially" with no monetary stimulus in the pipeline. So far, Gundlach and other bond bulls, including those in our poll, are on the right side of the bet. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note's price has risen, with its yield at 3.28 percent, down from 3.77 percent, a 9-1/2 month high, hit in February.
