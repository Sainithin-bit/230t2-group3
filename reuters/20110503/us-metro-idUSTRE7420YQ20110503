 DUESSELDORF, Germany  (Reuters) - Metro ( MEOG.DE ), the world's fourth-biggest retailer, added to fears that austerity measures and rising prices were holding back consumer spending even as the global economic recovery has been gaining momentum. 

 "Consumer sentiment in a large part of our portfolio is still fairly weak. Even German consumer confidence has weakened, resulting in a more volatile environment," chief executive Eckhard Cordes told analysts on a conference call on Tuesday. The German group, which runs cash and carries, hypermarkets, electricals and department stores, said first-quarter sales were flat at 15.52 billion euros, missing forecasts for a slight rise to 15.65 billion. Metro, keeping its forecasts for 2011 as a whole, said this was largely due to a late Easter and that including a 4 percent rise in April sales, four-month sales grew 1 percent. Germany is one of Europe's strongest recovering economies, boosted by its rapidly expanding export sector, and analysts were hopeful Metro would also benefit from robust growth in many of its eastern European markets. But latest data showed a surprise fall in German retail sales in March, and international retailers like French group Carrefour ( CARR.PA ) and British company Tesco ( TSCO.L ) have shown recently that strong sales in emerging markets were only partly offsetting difficult trading in western Europe. Particularly striking at Metro was a 4 percent fall in first-quarter like-for-like sales at MediaMarkt-Saturn consumer electronics stores, with Spanish stores contributing heavily to a 2.3 percent decline in overall group like-for-like sales. The MediaMarkt-Saturn chain, the largest in its sector in Europe, has lagged British rivals Dixons ( DXNS.L ) and Kesa KESA.L in online sales. Cordes said a new management team and the acquisition of online retailer Redcoon should help the group "make up lost time". Credit Suisse analysts said they still expected sales trends to improve at Metro in coming quarters, adding: "We can see little evidence from the Q1 numbers to yet support this view". They kept a "neutral" rating on Metro shares. Metro stock was down 2.3 percent at 48.34 euros at 0919 GMT, underperforming a 0.5 percent fall on Germany's benchmark Dax  .GDAXI  index. UNDERLYING SALES FALL Metro, with over 2,100 stores in 33 countries, reiterated it expects 2011 sales to rise over 4 percent and earnings to climb about 10 percent, depending on a "further improvement of the overall economic situation and the possibility to compensate price increases on the procurement side". The group had said in March the Japanese earthquake and unrest in the Arab world could put economic recovery more at risk, knocking its shares. Cordes told analysts his assessment of the economic environment had not changed since then. Metro has been boosting earnings thanks to a "Shape 2012" restructuring program launched in January 2009 with a goal of improving profit by 1.5 billion euros over three years. First-quarter underlying operating profit therefore rose 6.6 percent to 145 million euros ($215 million), compared with a 150 million euros forecast in a Reuters poll. RBS analyst Justin Scarborough, noting first-quarter earnings only accounted for about 5 percent of the full-year total, said a big fall in "other losses" underscored a disappointing performance at most of Metro's retail operations. Metro said sales fell 2.6 percent in Germany, which accounts for almost 40 percent of the total, and were down 1.9 percent in other western European markets. In contrast, sales climbed 2.5 percent in eastern Europe, and were up strongly in Asia/Africa. Like-for-like sales fell at all of its other three retail formats, with Kaufhof department stores down 3.9 percent, Real hypermarkets down 2.8 percent and cash and carry outlets down 0.7 percent. Metro shares have lagged the STOXX 600 European retail index .SXRP by 10 percent this year. They trade at 13 times forecast earnings, above Carrefour on 12.9 and Tesco on 11.1, according to Reuters data.
