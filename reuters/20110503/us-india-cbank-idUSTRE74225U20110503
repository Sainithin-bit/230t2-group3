 MUMBAI  (Reuters) - An increase in the savings bank deposit rate by the Indian central bank was not an indicator of deregulation, a deputy governor of the Reserve Bank of India said. 

 Subir Gokarn was addressing a press conference after the annual policy statement earlier in the day where the RBI increased key rates by a sharper-than-expected 50 basis points. The RBI has also raised savings bank deposit rate by 50 basis points to 4 percent with immediate effect. (Reporting by Neha D'silva and Aditya Phatak;Editing by Aradhana Aravindan)
