 MUMBAI  (Reuters) - India's central bank raised interest rates by a sharper-than-expected 50 basis points on Tuesday and said fighting inflation is its priority, even at the expense of short-term growth. 

 The rate rise was its ninth since March 2010, and exceeded market and economists' expectations for a 25 basis point rise, although the case for stronger action had been building since March headline inflation reached nearly 9 percent. KEY POINTS: - Repo rate, the short-term lending rate, up 50 basis points at 7.25 percent. - Reverse repo rate, the short-term borrowing rate, up 50 basis points at 6.25 percent. - Cash reserve ratio, the level of deposits that commercial banks must keep with the central bank, unchanged at 6.0 percent. COMMENTARY: SURESH KUMAR RAMANATHAN, REGIONAL RATES AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE STRATEGIST, CIMB INVESTMENT BANK IN KUALA LUMPUR: "Rates being raised by 50 bps, above what the market had anticipated, seriously begs the question whether markets were behind the curve. The move by RBI, was surprising and we note the rupee has picked up on this move by making further gains as part of knee-jerk reaction. Short-term growth slowdown on the back of this move is expected and it's obvious that RBI is keen on controlling inflation from spiraling. "Among regional currencies, our valuation matrix, considering the YTD gains for these currencies, interest rate and inflation differentials versus the USD, indicates the INR was rather undervalued. Thus today's rate hike will possibly strengthen the rupee going forward. Clearly the INR was one of the very few that has not exploited dollar weakness to the full, possibly it will after today's hike." GAURAV KAPUR, SENIOR ECONOMIST, RBS, MUMBAI: "The RBI has chosen to step up its efforts to curb inflation even at the cost of growth. The rate hike is aggressive keeping in mind the swift monetary transmission of earlier policy actions and pre-emptive considering that inflationary pressures remain strong despite limited pass through of international fuel prices. "Inflation is likely to remain in the 7-8 percent range until November. On the growth front, the RBI has sounded more sanguine by projecting lower growth at 8 percent. However, given the many downside risks to growth there is likely to be a downside bias to growth. "Having increased the tempo of its tightening the RBI is looking to ensure that it is ahead of the curve. Going forward, considering that significantly higher policy rates now, the RBI could look to raise rates by another 25-50 bps over the next few meetings. The new operating policy procedure would further help in more effective transmission of monetary policy and will put upward pressure on bank lending rates." JONATHAN CAVENAGH, SENIOR FX STRATEGIST, INSTITUTIONAL FX SALES, ASIA, AT WESTPAC INSTITUTIONAL BANK, SINGAPORE: "I think the market has welcomed it to some extent. Inflation has been a big concern for India recently and this move may well help boost the RBI's inflation fighting credentials. "Given INR's strong yield characteristics and some signs the USD is stabilizing, it may be worthwhile looking at going long INR on some crosses within the region on a yield play basis." RAMYA SURYANARAYANAN, ECONOMIST AT DBS BANK IN SINGAPORE: "The 50 bps hike is in line with our expectations. Inflation has consistently surprised on the upside and there is little choice but for the central bank to send a strong tightening signal/anti-inflation stance as they have done. "We expect a stand pat at the next meeting and then another 50 bps hike at the policy meeting in July though it is also possible there is a 25 bps hike at the next meeting and another 25 bps hike at the July meeting." ABHEEK BARUA, CHIEF ECONOMIST, HDFC BANK, NEW DELHI: "There was a serious credibility issue with the Reserve Bank of India's inflation projection. This aggressive action addresses that issue. The RBI is talking more realistically about the inflation trajectory and responding a little more aggressively. "It is a more adequate action than in the past. In the long term, it will help to curb inflation, but not immediately. We are expecting another 75 basis points hike in 2011." RADHIKA RAO, ECONOMIST, FORECAST PTE IN SINGAPORE: "Sharp uptick in March WPI and rebound in weekly food and fuel measure justified the aggressive rate hike. Above expectations move will put to bed criticism that measured policy moves had blunted transmission to retail/interbank rates. "Upward revision to WPI estimate and lowering growth were also timely, providing a more realistic economic outlook. We expect at least another 75 bps more hikes by end-year." RUPA REGE NITSURE, CHIEF ECONOMIST, BANK OF BARODA, MUMBAI: "I think it is a prudent policy given the concerns on the inflation front. I feel that other macro prudential regulations that the RBI has introduced also augur very well for the banking industry. "Instead of a hasty move to deregulate the savings banks' rate, they (the RBI) have hiked it to 4 percent, and it will play an effective role in transmission of the monetary policy signals. "...going forward, they (the RBI) will monitor the performance of monsoon and how effective interest rate hikes so far are in containing excess demand. I think another 50 bps is certainly expected over the rest of the calendar year." SUJAN HAJRA, CHIEF ECONOMIST, ANAND RATHI FINANCIAL SERVICES, MUMBAI: "This rate hike is significantly higher than expectations and reflects strong concerns of inflation on part of the central bank. This is positive in the sense they are out of the baby steps into the aggressive mode. "Already, the investment growth remains significantly subdued and this hike might create further uncertainty on the investment and growth front." A PRASANNA, ECONOMIST, ICICI SECURITIES PRIMARY DEALERSHIP, MUMBAI: "We expect the RBI to pause after pushing the repo rate to 7.75 percent by end-2011, since the central bank will be in a position to control inflation at that rate for some time at least. "Simultaneously, however, we can expect the 10-year bond yield to peak out at 8.40 percent in next two months." JAY SHANKAR, CHIEF ECONOMIST - DIRECTOR, RELIGARE CAPITAL MARKETS, MUMBAI: "We believe that the markets will take this faster tightening positively. However, inflation is likely to peak only at around 12 percent around Sept-October The impact of higher oil prices still have to be factored in the headline numbers. This is a serious downside risk to our FY12 growth estimates. "However, we would want to wait till the new IIP series is out in June - for the month of April, before revising our industrial and overall GDP growth estimates for FY12." ANIS CHAKRAVARTY, DIRECTOR, DELOITTE, HASKIN & SELLS, MUMBAI: "It's quite a bold move from the RBI. Somewhere the RBI recognizes the importance of tacking headline inflation. The governor has also come out with the concerns of the high commodity prices. However, I am not fully convinced that this step will tackle the core issue of inflation which is actually a supply side driven instead of demand side." ASHUTOSH DATAR, ECONOMIST, IIFL, MUMBAI: "No real surprise on the central bank's thoughts on inflation. So we can now expect rates to be increased by at least another 50 basis points by end-2011. Further rate hikes will depend upon how commodity prices pan out and moderation in growth takes place." MARKET REACTION: - The partially convertible rupee strengthened marginally to 44.3200 per dollar from 44.3750 prior to the central bank's policy announcement. - The yield on the 10-year bond rose 4 basis points to 8.21 percent. - The benchmark five-year swap rate rose 13 basis points to 8.39 percent; while the one-year rate rose 16 basis points to 8.06 percent. - The 30-share BSE index extended losses to 0.4 percent, compared with 0.3 percent beforehand. BACKGROUND: - Food price index rose 8.76 percent and fuel price index climbed 13.53 percent in the year to April 16, government data on Thursday showed. - Headline inflation surged to nearly 9 percent in March on higher fuel and manufacturing prices. - Repo, reverse repo rates seen rising total 75 bps by end-Dec, a poll done last week showed. - Production at factories, mines and utilities grew 3.6 percent on year in February dragged down by continued contraction in capital goods. - India's manufacturing sector maintained its strong rate of expansion in April, helped by higher output and employment.
