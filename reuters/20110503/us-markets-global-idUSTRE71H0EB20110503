 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Commodities suffered their biggest one-day loss in two weeks on Tuesday, pulling stocks on Wall Street down as well, after fear that huge price gains last month had made everything from oil to silver too costly. 

 The dollar's rebound after a 10-day slide was a catalyst to the selloff. The greenback was volatile, rising as U.S. markets opened, then falling at midday before surging again toward the close. Analysts said the dollar swung on concerns that it may have been oversold to a three-year low while stocks and commodities marched to some of their biggest gains in April. "You've had a tremendous run-up here, so you've got some profit-taking and an underlying rotation" out of commodity shares into more defensive sectors, said Paul Mendelsohn, chief investment strategist at Windham Financial Services in Charlotte, Vermont. "My modeling tells me (commodities) are very, very overextended," which means a pullback in commodity sectors may be due, he said. Shares on Wall Street extended losses in afternoon trading, with technology stocks falling more than 1 percent. Oil prices slid up to 3 percent, ending sharply off Monday's 31-month highs of above $114 a barrel in New York and above $126 per barrel in London. The selloff began early in the session, after a higher-than-expected interest rate hike by India, and accelerated in the afternoon. <O/R> Analysts said oil could be headed even lower. "I think this market has gotten way ahead of itself," said Richard Ilczyszyn, senior market strategist at Lind-Waldock in Chicago. "I can see this market easily dropping back below $100. We'll seen build after build after build." Gold fell more than half a percent on the day and about 2 percent off Monday's record highs of above $1,575 an ounce. Traders said the dollar's rebound took away some of gold's luster as an alternative currency. <GOL/> While the volatile dollar was certainly a factor for Tuesday's liquidation in commodities, analysts said some of the selling could be due to smaller markets such as silver, which fell nearly 6 percent in value as it retreated sharply from recent record highs near $50 per ounce. "We are seeing accelerated margin selling in silver ... and it's spilling over into gold and crude oil. When you have big margin selling in one commodity, it has a cascading impact on the markets," said Bill O'Neill, partner at New Jersey's LOGIC Advisers. Robust corporate earnings in the United States and Europe have buoyed equities recently, though some investors say the market is reaching overbought levels. High commodity prices, sparked by a weak dollar and supply worries, have also raised concern about company margins. U.S. stocks were trading lower at 3:52 p.m. EDT (1952 GMT). The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  was down 9.04 points, or 0.07 percent, at 12,798.32. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  was down 5.41 points, or 0.40 percent, at 1,355.81. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  was down 24.24 points, or 0.85 percent, at 2,839.84. World stocks measured by the MSCI All-Country World Index .MIWD00000PUS shed 1 percent after five sessions of gains, and the emerging share index .MSCIEF lost 1.7 percent to a two-week low. The MSCI world gauge gained 3.9 percent last month, and is up about 7.5 percent so far this year. The 19-commodity Reuters-Jefferies CRB index .CRB was down 0.9 percent, posting its largest one-day loss since April 18. The dollar index .DXY, which tracks the dollar against a basket of major currencies, settled up 0.3 percent after falling 0.4 percent earlier in the session. A Reuters poll on Tuesday showed that investors have pulled back some of their exposure to equities acquired in April, buying bonds and turning to safe-haven cash amid worries that global economic growth could falter from its rapid pace. Investors are facing uncertain times regarding interest rates, with the European Central Bank having already tightened and the Bank of England under pressure to follow suit. India's bigger-than-expected hike of 50 basis points in interest rates on Tuesday spooked investors. In the United States, the Federal Reserve has committed to keeping extraordinarily low rates while signaling that its $600 billion bond purchase program will end as scheduled in June. "The most uncertainty is probably about future economic policy. ... A slowdown while policy is being tightened may be unnerving for investors used to three years of very easy policy conditions," said Chris Paine, associate director for asset allocation at Henderson Global Investors in London. Reuters' poll of 56 leading investment houses in the United States, Europe excluding Britain, Japan and Britain showed exposure to stocks falling to 51.3 percent in the month from 52.6 percent in March. Appetite for cash rose to 5.1 percent in a balanced portfolio from 4.7 percent a month earlier. It was the highest exposure to cash -- where investors park money in times of uncertainty -- since September, around the time stock markets began rallying on prospects for renewed asset buying by the Federal Reserve. "We're moving into seasonally weak conditions (for equities) with May and June here, and the macro story may be at risk if oil prices shoot to $130 per barrel or so. There are too many things that can go wrong," said Keith Wirtz, chief investment officer at U.S. firm Fifth Third Asset Management.
