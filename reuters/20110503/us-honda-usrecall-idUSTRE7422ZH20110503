 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Honda Motor Co Ltd expanded an earlier recall of Honda and Acura vehicles over replacement airbags that could deploy with too much pressure, causing injuries or fatalities, the company said on Tuesday. 

 The expanded recall adds 833,000 vehicles for the model years 2001 through 2003. Honda is looking for 2,430 replacement airbags that could contain the defect. These additional vehicles were not included in earlier safety recalls because the  original airbag modules on the driver's side were not affected by the issue. But replacement airbags could contain the defect, Honda said. The replacement airbag inflators could deploy with too much pressure, causing the inflator casing to rupture. This could result in injury or a fatality. The recall includes some 2001 and 2002 Accord and Civic sedans, 2002 Odyssey minivans and 2002 and 2003 CR-V crossover vehicles. It also includes 2002 and 2003 Acura 3.2 TL and 2003 3.2 CL vehicles. (Reporting by  Deepa Seetharaman  and  Ben Klayman , editing by Gerald E. McCormick)
