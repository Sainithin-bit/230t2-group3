 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Archer Daniels Midland Co ( ADM.N ) posted only modest gains in its agricultural services business, due to volatile commodities prices, instability in the Middle East and Africa, and logistical challenges in Japan. 

 Antigovernment protests in North Africa and the Middle East earlier this year disrupted grain shipments to the key commodities importing region, hurting ADM's bottom line. That was followed by delays in shipments to Japan, the world's top corn importer and a major soybean and wheat importer, following the March 11 earthquake and tsunami. "When you cannot offload ships and you have them sitting out to sea determining when you can offload them, when it comes to valuations, it can make a difference," said John Rice, ADM's vice chairman, said on a call with analysts. The agricultural processor also warned about the impact of elevated energy prices and global instability going forward. The company's third-quarter overall earnings rose on strong results in its corn and oilseed processing segments. For the fiscal third-quarter ended March 31, ADM reported net earnings of $578 million, or 86 cents per share, matching the average analyst estimate, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. In the same quarter a year ago, ADM earned a net $421 million, or 65 cents per share. Quarterly revenue rose to $20.1 billion, topping analyst expectations for $17.7 billion. The Decatur, Illinois-based company is one of the largest processors of corn and soybeans in the world and among the top ethanol producers in the United States. ADM said on Tuesday crop shortages in some areas of the world led to highly volatile grain and oilseed prices and that demand for crops and agricultural goods continues to rise. Oilseeds processing profit jumped 26 percent to $512 million, helped by strong results in its North American elevators and processing plants and its refining, packaging and biodiesel operations in the Americas, ADM said. Profit in ADM's corn processing segment, which includes its ethanol and sweeteners businesses, nearly doubled to $204 million. Corn processing volume rose 13 percent, helped by accelerating production at two recently build ethanol plants and strong demand for corn-based sweeteners and feed ingredients. Profit at the company's agricultural services division rose by $6 million to $171 million, tempered by volatile commodities markets, regional instability in the Middle East and Africa, and logistical problems in Japan, a top importer. The company's other business units, including wheat milling and cocoa operations, generated a net profit of $119 million, up from $22 million a year earlier. ADM shares fell 4.8 percent to $35.22 on the New York Stock Exchange. (Reporting by Karl Plume; Editing by  Derek Caney )
