 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Clorox Co ( CLX.N ) posted disappointing quarterly results and forecast earnings for the next fiscal year below analysts' estimates, hurt by rising packaging and materials costs and a still-sluggish economy. 

 Shares of the household products maker fell more than 4 percent on Tuesday. To alleviate pressure on its margins, the company said it raised prices on its Glad trash bags by 9.5 percent, effective May 2. But the company said it expects declines in sales volume to offset gains from the price increases in fiscal year 2012, which begins in July. Putting through price increases is difficult for Clorox while consumers are hesitant to pay more for name-brand products in some areas arenas where the company competes. "Consumers aren't going to pay up for a product if they don't feel there is value added to that offering," Morningstar analyst Erin Lash said. She noted that the plastic bag segment "is a category where consumers have not shown a willingness to trade up, or have shown more of a willingness to trade down." Clorox said it expects earnings from continuing operations to be $4.00 a share to $4.10 a share in fiscal year 2012, including 18 to 20 cents a share in technology and facilities investments. Analysts on average had forecast $4.40, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company, which also makes Hidden Valley Ranch salad dressing and its namesake bleach, is hopeful that new products like Brita water bottles can help it rebound. Net earnings were $151 million, or $1.09 per share, in the fiscal third quarter that ended in March, down from $165 million, or $1.16 a share, a year earlier. Excluding items, the company earned $1.02 a share. Analysts on average were expecting $1.04 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Sales rose 1.3 percent to $1.30 billion, while analysts had expected $1.32 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Clorox shares fell $2.85 to $67.14 Tuesday morning on the New York Stock Exchange.
