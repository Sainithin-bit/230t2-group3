 BIRMINGHAM, Alabama  (Reuters) - A lawyer for the creditors trustee in America's biggest municipal bankruptcy on Friday said the trustee will not make a February 1 payment to owners of $3.14 billion of sewer debt issued by Alabama's Jefferson County. 
 Gerald Mace, an attorney for creditors trustee, Bank of New York Mellon, told a bankruptcy court hearing that the distribution could not be made because of a "lack of funds". The size of the payments drawn from sewer system revenues varies and the amount of the expected payment was not known, county officials at the hearing said.
