 PARIS  (Reuters) - French car sales dropped 15 percent in January, the country's main automakers' association said on Friday, with Volkswagen ( VOWG_p.DE ) and U.S. carmakers suffering the worst declines. 
 Registrations in France fell to 124,952 cars last month from 147,046 a year earlier, the Paris-based CCFA said in a statement. Sales of delivery vans also fell 13.9 percent, leading to a 9.1 percent drop for light vehicle registrations overall. PSA Peugeot Citroen ( PEUP.PA ) recorded a 16.7 percent domestic car sales decline, the CCFA said. Smaller domestic rival Renault ( RENA.PA ) saw its registrations tumble a more modest 7.4 percent - softened by a 9.9 percent gain at its low-cost Dacia brand. Sales by Volkswagen, Europe's biggest carmaker, plunged 23.9 percent to 16,846 cars, while combined sales by General Motors' ( GM.N ) Chevrolet and Opel/Vauxhall brands dropped 21.2 percent. Ford ( F.N ) registrations dropped 35.3 percent. (Reporting by Laurence Frost)
