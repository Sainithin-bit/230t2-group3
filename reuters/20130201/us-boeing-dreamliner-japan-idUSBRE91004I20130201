 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japan's Civil Aviation Bureau said on Friday it would send two investigators to Seattle as part of the probe of the battery problem on Boeing's ( BA.N ) 787 Dreamliner. 
 The global fleet of 50 Dreamliners, 17 of which are operated by Japan's All Nippon Airways ( 9202.T ), has remained grounded while investigators in Japan and the United States attempt to find out what caused one battery to catch fire on a 787 operated by Japan Airlines Co ( 9201.T ) in Boston earlier this month, and a second battery to burn on ANA's domestic flight.
