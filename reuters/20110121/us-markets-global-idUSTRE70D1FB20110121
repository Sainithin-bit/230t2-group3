 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The euro hit a two-month high above $1.36 on Friday on hopes the euro zone will find a durable solution for its debt crisis, while world stocks gained as robust GE earnings foreshadowed a stronger U.S. economy. 

 European banking shares jumped on Spain's plan to partially take over its weakest saving banks. Coupled with expectations of a strengthened euro zone rescue fund, the plan to save Spanish banks helped ease tensions over the European crisis. "Markets are clearly buying into the view that the European debt crisis is being resolved with modest pain," said Steven Englander, head of G10 FX strategy at Citigroup in New York. The euro strengthened for the fourth consecutive session, also boosted by a report showing German business confidence rose to its highest level in 20 years in January. The European single currency was trading at $1.3613, up 1.02 percent from Thursday's close. It has rallied nearly 5 percent since a low of $1.2916 reached on January 7. The dollar was 0.85 percent weaker against a basket of major currencies, according to the U.S. dollar index .DXY. Against the Japanese yen, the greenback was down 0.51 percent at 82.56. GE SUPPORTS DOW World stocks rallied after two sessions of losses as General Electric Co ( GE.N ), the largest U.S. conglomerate, reported stronger-than-expected quarterly earnings and its first rise in overall revenue since late 2008. GE shares jumped 5.6 percent on the New York Stock Exchange, accounting for the largest portion of gains of the Dow industrials. But Google Inc ( GOOG.O ) erased early gains to finish 2.38 percent lower, one day after reporting stronger-than-expected quarterly results. The action in Google shares was "not so much Google earnings, but a factor of the market itself," said Robert Francello, head of equity trading for Apex Capital in San Francisco. "We had such a massive run in the end of December and early this month, we might be seeing selling into good earnings," he said, adding that fast-money investors seem to be preparing themselves for some consolidation in the short term. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  ended up 49.04 points, or 0.41 percent, at 11,871.84, while the Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  rose 3.09 points, or 0.24 percent, to 1,283.35. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  declined 14.75 points, or 0.55 percent, to 2,689.54. In Europe, the FTSEurofirst 300  .FTEU3  index of top shares closed 0.8 percent higher, after falling 2.4 percent in the previous two sessions. Major Spanish banks advanced, with Banco Santander ( SAN.MC ) up 3.78 percent and BBVA ( BBVA.MC ) rising 3.36 percent. World stocks measured by the MSCI All-Country World Index .MIWD00000PUS climbed 0.46 percent, but the benchmark indicator still posted its largest weekly loss in eight weeks. GOLD POSTS 3RD WEEKLY LOSS The increase in appetite for stocks reduced the safe-haven allure of gold, which posted its third weekly loss. Spot gold prices fell 0.27 percent, to $1,341.80 an ounce. U.S. gold futures for February delivery settled down $5.50 at $1,341 an ounce. Prices of U.S. Treasuries rose, but analysts said the broad improvement in the U.S. economy and expectations of interest rate rises by major central banks are likely to keep bond prices down. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note was up 11/32 in price, with the yield at 3.4101 percent. U.S. crude oil fell 0.54 percent, to $89.11 a barrel on news of rising domestic stockpiles. In London, however, Brent crude oil futures jumped 1.06 percent to $97.60 a barrel as the dollar fell against the euro and confidence on the European recovery increased.
