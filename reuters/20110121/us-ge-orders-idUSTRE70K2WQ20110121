 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - General Electric Co reported better-than-expected earnings, helped by the recovery of its finance arm and higher industrial sales. 

 The world's biggest maker of electric turbines and jet engines also reported a 12 percent rise in orders, driving its backlog -- a key predictor of future sales -- to $175 billion. Below are some of the recent orders GE has highlighted: * More than $5.8 billion in commercial aviation service and equipment orders and over $3 billion in long-term service contracts with LAN, Cathay, COMAC and Delta, among others. * More than $750 million in contracts from India's Reliance Power for power generation technology. * $700 million agreements for power-generation equipment and services for the new high-efficiency Riyadh PP11 power plant in Saudi Arabia. * $500 million contract with Saudi Aramco for equipment and services to expand Shaybah gas-oil processing facilities. Earlier this week, GE announced several China agreements, tied to President Hu Jintao's visit to the United States. These included: * Letter of intent with China`s Ministry of Railways valued at $1.4 billion, including $350 million for export in locomotives, service and related systems. * Joint venture with China Shenhua Energy Company Ltd to advance cleaner coal technology for industrial chemicals, fuels and power generation. GE estimates $1.5 billion to $2.5 billion in U.S. exports over the long term. * Agreement with China Huadian Corporation to develop efficient natural gas solutions for China. GE forecasts at least 50 gas-turbine generator sets sold and installed in China within five years, resulting in $500 million of revenue for the partnership and $350 million in U.S. gas turbine exports. * Joint venture with Aviation Industry Corporation of China to develop and market new generation avionics systems to support development of China`s first home-grown big passenger jet. The joint venture will result in $300 million in exports. (Reporting by Nick Zieminski; Editing by  Derek Caney )
