 AMSTERDAM  (Reuters) - Big companies put dozens of software developers to work designing apps that can combine virtual information with the physical world, but it is possible to build a "layer" without any programing skills. 

 Using a free tool provided by Stuttgart-based software firm Hoppala, it took a Reuters correspondent just a few hours to create a basic layer that shows information about companies in the augmented reality industry. It was simply a matter of picking a location, ticking a few boxes and adding a few -- very short -- lines of information. The Amsterdam-based browser company Layar had to approve it, but in days it was there for anyone to see. One downside: the space for text is very tight in Layar. Readers with an iPhone or Google Android smartphone or tablet can check it out by searching on Layar's browser for "AR by Reuters, '11." When you are running the app near one of the companies' headquarters, your screen will offer the option of finding out more. For those without a compatible phone, or who just want to see the basics, a copy of the app's contents will be posted to http:/blogs.reuters.com/the-deep-end/ during Friday.
