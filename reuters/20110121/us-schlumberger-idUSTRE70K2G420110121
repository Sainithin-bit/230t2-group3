 NEW YORK/SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Schlumberger Ltd ( SLB.N ), the world's largest oilfield services company, posted higher-than-expected profits and saw a good year ahead, but its stock fell as it began looking expensive compared with peers. 

 The company boosted its dividend for the first time in three years, and its shares rose to within $1 of a 28-month peak before they retreated along with oil prices. "The stock's had an awfully good run. There's going to be some digestion, that's just normal," said John Parry, analyst at IHS Herold, pointing to Schlumberger's "generous" multiple of more than 20 times forecast 2011 earnings. Schlumberger shares had risen 60 percent in less than five months as investors geared up for international growth. Rival Halliburton Co ( HAL.N ) is up by 40 percent in that time, and trades at just 14 times estimated 2011 earnings. Parry sees a 30 percent upside for the Philadelphia Stock Exchange oil service index .OSX, yet he noted that does not mean all the companies in the index have so much room to grow. Fourth-quarter profits grew by 28 percent for Schlumberger. Because of its global reach and insights into drillers' plans, analysts watch just as carefully for the views of Schlumberger's chief executive, Andrew Gould. With another healthy increase in oil demand expected in 2011, Gould, who is due to retire later this year, said strong oil prices would boost spending on exploration -- the "swing factor" in operators' budgets. "We find customers making a lot of inquiries that they weren't making three months ago," Gould said of clients in key exploration areas. "It's the swing factor because it's the only thing they can ramp up quickly," he said on a conference call. Due to the U.S. regulatory overhaul, Gould did not see any exploration wells being drilled in the Gulf of Mexico in 2011. Looking at two other important markets for the company, Gould said he expected to see "considerable uncertainty" around spending in Mexico, but a generally better year in Russia. A closely watched survey of energy companies from Barclays Capital in December showed global exploration and production expenditures are expected to rise 11 percent this year, with much of that earmarked for emerging markets. Schlumberger itself will raise capital expenditure in 2011 to about $4 billion from $2.9 billion last year. GROWTH BEYOND AMERICA Drilling for natural gas in North America has begun to slow because of weak prices for the fuel. While producers have shifted to liquids projects, analysts see growth flattening. It is the oilfield services demand elsewhere that favors Schlumberger, since three-quarters of its business is outside North America, compared with about half for Halliburton. "We think they (Schlumberger) could see 30 percent earnings growth this year, and potentially, it could be comparable to that in 2012," said Brian Youngberg, analyst at Edward Jones. Fourth-quarter profit rose to $1.04 billion, or 76 cents per share, from $817 million, or 67 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, Schlumberger earned 85 cents per share, topping the 77 cents that analysts expected, according to the average on Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Lifted by the acquisition of Smith International, revenue rose 58 percent to $9.07 billion, while analysts had expected $8.7 billion. Schlumberger's oilfield services revenue grew 16 percent, and seismic mapping unit WesternGeco grew 2 percent. This quarter, Schlumberger is moving to three reporting lines from two to better reflect its profile after last year's acquisitions: a $1 billion takeover of French drilling analysis firm Geoservices and the $11 billion Smith deal, which gave it complete control of drilling fluids business M-I Swaco. The three groups are reservoir characterization, including WesternGeco and other well testing and consulting services involved in locating oil and gas deposits; drilling, which will include M-I Swaco and much of Smith; and reservoir production, encompassing revenue earned once a well starts producing. The board also approved a 19 percent increase in the annual dividend to $1 a share, the first increase since January 2008. Schlumberger shares were down 1.8 percent at $83.78 in afternoon trading. At Thursday's close, they were up 23 percent over the past year, in line with the index but ahead of the 17 percent gain for Halliburton, which reports earnings on Monday. The next day, smaller competitors Baker Hughes Inc ( BHI.N ) and Weatherford International Ltd ( WFT.N )( WFT.S ) will report.
