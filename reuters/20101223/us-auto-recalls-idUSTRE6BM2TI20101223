 DETROIT  (Reuters) - General Motors Co is recalling 109,000 Cadillac CTS cars worldwide for the model years 2005 to 2007 because a mat under the seat that senses the front passenger could break and disable the front air bag. 

 Repeated "flexing" of the passenger sensing system mat in the front seat could cause the mat to "kink, bend or fold," according to a notice posted by the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and GM on Thursday. This could break the connections in the mat and as a result the sensor may not detect the front passenger and will disable the air bag. The mats must be replaced. Of the 95,927 cars recalled in the United States, GM is recalling 46,070 cars from the 2006 model year and 33,138 from the 2007 model year. The remainder are from the 2005 model year. GM said there were no injuries or fatalities linked to this defect. The recalls are the latest in a string involving GM, which re-entered the public markets last month in a record initial public offering. Last week, GM recalled about 111,000 Chevy Equinox, GMC Terrain and Cadillac SRX 2011 small SUV models because the anchor to the seatbelt buckle may fail. In November, GM recalled nearly 200,000 compact pickup trucks due to missing child seat anchors-- an issue not linked to last week's recall. Additionally, U.S. safety regulators are investigating reports of power steering loss and crashes in 2004-2007 Saturn Ion sedans. GM closed the Saturn brand. In a separate notice Thursday, GM said it was recalling more than 1,200 Cadillac Escalade EXT, Chevrolet Avalanche and Silverado and GMC Sierra vehicles for 2011 model year. In these vehicles, the rear axle cross pin might fracture or shift out of position. This might cause the rear axle to lock and the driver might lose control of the car. HONDA'S RECALL Separately, Honda Motor Co Ltd told safety regulators it was recalling 10,823 Accord V-6 vehicles for the 2010 and 2011 model year as well as 2011 Pilot vehicles. The damper brackets in 2011 Pilots may not have been tightened during assembly due to a programing error, Honda said in a notice. Loose bolts can increase the risk of steering loss and cause excess noise. Additionally, the spindle nuts of 2011 Pilot and certain Accord V-6 vehicles may also be loose, a defect that can cause steering loss. In early June, Honda received a complaint from NHTSA hotline saying the front suspension of a 2011 Pilot had collapsed, according to the automaker's letter to regulators. Honda investigated the matter and determined it to be an isolated event caused by operator error, but after further investigation and another complaint in November, Honda determined that the problem was due to a computer error. Last week, Honda said it would notify 1,200 owners of 2011 model year Accords and CR-Vs of possible engine oil leaks. (Reporting by Deepa Seetharaman; Editing by  Derek Caney )
