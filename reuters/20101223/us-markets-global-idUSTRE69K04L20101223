 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Crude oil prices hit two-year highs above $91 a barrel propelled by more evidence on Thursday the U.S. economy is strengthening, but world stock prices were little changed with some indexes holding near two year peaks. 

 The euro gyrated throughout the day, falling at one point to three week lows before recovering ground, only to come under more selling pressure after Fitch Ratings cut Portugal's debt one notch to A-plus from AA-minus citing a difficult financing environment and recession for the economy in 2011. Most financial markets were left to meander in thin trade ahead of the Christmas and New Year holidays, though stocks remained around their best levels since before the collapse of investment bank Lehman Brothers in September 2008. U.S. economic data showed signs of further improvement with new claims for jobless benefits falling, and consumer spending increasing in November for a fifth straight month. Orders for long-lasting manufactured goods excluding transportation increased 2.4 percent, the largest increase since March, after a 1.9 percent drop in October. The U.S. data contrasted with developments in Europe where China said it was willing to help countries in the euro zone return to economic health and would support the International Monetary Fund bailout package for the bloc. Crude oil prices for February delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange rose 89 cents, or 0.98 percent, to $91.37 a barrel on Thursday. Cold weather in the United States plus shrinking U.S. stockpiles and projections among OPEC members and analysts that prices could reach $100 a barrel soon, supported the market even with the greenback's strength. "It's fair to say it (the price) is about right, but still I think that it needs to improve a little bit more. About $100 would be a fair price for the time being," Libya's National Oil Corp Chairman Shokri Ghanem told Reuters in Cairo ahead of a meeting of Arab oil exporting countries. Spot gold prices fell $4.60, or 0.33 percent, to $1,380. STOCKS In midday New York trade, the major stock indexes were mixed. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  rose 8.74 points, or 0.08 percent, to 11,568.23. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  fell 1.96 points, or 0.16 percent, to 1,256.88. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  lost 5.84 points, or 0.22 percent, at 2,665.64. Retail stocks got a boost as Bed Bath & Beyond Inc ( BBBY.O )rose 5.73 percent to $50.40 after it beat quarterly profit estimates and forecast a strong holiday season. On Wednesday, the S&P 500 rose to its highest level since the collapse of Lehman Brothers, led by bank stocks. In Europe, shares were mixed as well. The FTSEurofirst 300  .FTEU3  index of top European shares closed down 0.1 percent at 1,146.69 points, having reached as high as 1,149.05 earlier. London's FTSE 100  .FTSE  topped the 6,000-mark on Thursday for the first time since June 2008 before ending at 5,996.07, up 0.21 percent on the day. "Expectations have improved a lot because we haven't had a double dip (recession), earnings are strong and the consensus for the economy next year will be strong," said Mark Bon, fund manager at Canada Life in London. However, with the sovereign debt crisis in the background he didn't think people were "all-out bullish," Bon said, adding that the other concern was whether China would be successful in cooling its property market. The euro traded up in midday New York action, gaining just 0.12 percent at $1.3115, while the dollar fell 0.74 percent to 82.93 yen. Japanese markets were closed on Thursday in observance of the Emperor's birthday. Against a basket of currencies made up of its major trading partners, the dollar fell 0.29 percent. Benchmark 10-year U.S. treasuries fell 11/32 of a point in price, pushing the yield up to 3.39 percent.
