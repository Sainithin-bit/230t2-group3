 DUBLIN  (Reuters) - The Irish government said it would inject state funds into Bank of Ireland ( BKIR.L ) and Irish Life & Permanent ( IPM.I ) if they were unable to raise additional capital from private sources. 

 "We are going to have to ensure that Bank of Ireland and Irish Life also meet their capital requirements," finance minister Brian Lenihan told state broadcaster RTE on Thursday. "In the absence of private funding we will have to capitalize them as well." Lenihan also said the government would speed up the winding down of nationalized lenders Anglo Irish Bank ANGIB.UL and Irish Nationwide IRNBS.UL. "We are going to have to accelerate the phasing out of Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide very early in the new year." (Reporting by Carmel Crimmins; Editing by Dan Lalor)
