 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve worried about exposing its balance sheet to credit risks when it launched a lending facility for top bond dealers in an emergency move in mid-March, minutes of two Fed meetings released on Friday showed. 

 The U.S. central bank, which at the same time approved emergency financing to prevent problems at investment bank Bear Stearns from infecting the entire financial system, saw evidence other investment banks may have been in trouble too, minutes of a March 16 meeting said. The Fed's orchestration of the rescue of Bear Stearns and extension of credit to nonbank firms for the first time since the Great Depression came at the height of the credit crisis triggered by a wave of failed mortgages. The Fed has come under fire for intervening in markets and putting taxpayer funds at risk, but the move is also viewed by some as a bold stroke that spared the national economy from financial meltdown. Fed officials saw conditions as dire enough to justify extraordinary measures but were concerned about losses and wondered how long they would need to keep the unusual safety net in place, according to minutes of the two emergency meetings. "Board members considered whether six months was an appropriate duration for the facility, and they asked about provisions in the new facility for protecting the Federal Reserve against credit risk," the minutes said. The New York Fed on Thursday valued its loan to JPMorgan to buy Bear Stearns at $28.8 billion. The line of credit is backed by a portfolio of bonds and other fixed-income products held by Bear Stearns before it collapsed. The Fed has said the portfolio contains collateralized mortgage obligations, most of which are backed by government-sponsored mortgage finance agencies. It also contains asset-backed securities, adjustable rate mortgages, commercial mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized bond obligations. Many potential investors had been invited to invest in Bear Stearns, but Bear Stearns determined that JPMorgan was the most suitable bidder, the minutes from the Fed's March 14 meeting said. The Fed normally restricted emergency funding for deposit-taking banks and cited financial market turmoil as justification for making the exception. Central bank officials are deliberating whether to extend the life of the primary dealer credit facility beyond six months. Policy-makers have said that the Fed should be given greater authority to supervise securities firms if it is to keep the discount window open to them.
