 LONDON  (Reuters) - Mergers and acquisitions bankers are bracing for more job cuts as volumes fail to recover from their first-quarter tumble, according to preliminary Thomson Reuters numbers released on Friday, and the outlook remains bleak for the rest of 2008. 

 Global M&A activity fell 35 percent in the year to date to $1.579 trillion, according to the first-half data, as the credit crunch kept buyout firms away from large deals and economic uncertainty made companies reluctant to push the button. Private equity buyout activity, which underpinned the recent M&A boom, fell 66 percent in Europe to $48 billion and slumped by 86 percent in the United States to $42 billion in the first half. With inflation rising and no end in sight for economic woes in the United States and Europe, it seems unlikely that volumes will recover quickly to the record levels seen for the year until June 2007, observers said. "We won't see a boom like early 2007 again for another three or four years," said Hermann Prelle, joint-head of EMEA investment banking at UBS. Several banks, including Citigroup Inc and Goldman Sachs Group Inc, have already shed M&A jobs to try to adapt to the slower market, and there could be more cuts as the slowdown in activity eats into banks' income. In the United States, the world's biggest economy, a slowdown and bleak outlook were compounded this week as U.S. consumer confidence hit a 16-year low and housing prices suffered a record annual drop. The slowdown that started with the credit crunch last summer has spread and is now undermining much of the economic stability in Europe and the United States that allowed the M&A boom. Rocky equities markets this year have not inspired confidence either. "The deal completion rate is lower at the moment because we are in a volatile market that makes underlying valuations difficult to pin down," said David Livingstone, head of M&A for Europe, Middle East and Africa at Credit Suisse AG. "So you have a widening of value expectations between buyers and sellers, and deals are harder to do." Emerging markets could help take some sting off the crisis. Western companies are continuing to invest in new countries for growth, and investors from Asia are entering Europe, either by buying whole companies or as passive investors. India's Tata Motors Ltd agreed to buy Jaguar and Land Rover from U.S. auto giant Ford Motor Co in March for $2.3 billion. Multiple Chinese, Asian and Middle Eastern wealth funds have invested billions of dollars in cash-craving Western financial institutions. But the new entrants are unlikely to reach the scale needed to shift sentiment. "The market has seen a sharp slowdown in the U.S., in particular as it relates to financial sponsors activity," said Brett Olsher, co-head of global mergers and acquisitions at Deutsche Bank. "The industry needs to make a call on whether business from emerging markets will step in to make up for those slowdowns, which it will to an extent, but not nearly enough to reverse the decline." Cross-border corporate mergers like InBev NV's $55 billion bid -- including debt assumed -- for U.S. rival Anheuser-Busch Cos Inc and France Telecom SA's $48 billion approach to Swedish rival TeliaSonera ABmake up the rest of those numbers, said bankers. And while the mid-market private equity sector is still seeing deals, they are not big enough to keep the numbers -- and banker fees -- as high as they were. "We are still seeing a healthy number of deals -- albeit lower than the first half of last year -- but on average they are smaller than in the recent past, and that pattern seems likely to continue during the rest of the year," said Ian Hart, Citigroup's co-head of M&A for Europe, Middle-East and Africa. It is unclear when U.S. and European M&A markets will recover, and bankers are mostly talking about early 2009 rather than the second half of 2008. Hence, some are encouraging clients to do deals soon or risk a worsening market. A hope for bankers is that clients, despite the relative uncertainty, consider doing deals now -- possibly combinations that would help them weather a recession -- rather than wait in the hope of a quick end to the market slowdown. "There are two schools of thought," said Carlo Calabria, Merrill Lynch & Co Inc's head of M&A for Europe, Middle East and Africa, "The first is that M&A will come back toward the end of the year. The second is this may be the beginning of a bit of an ice age, and we should try to collect all the nuts." (Additional reporting by Eleanor Wason, editing by Jeffrey Benkoe,  Gary Hill )
