 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  of stocks slid on Friday into bear market territory as investors fretted about the impact of record oil prices and mounting credit losses in the financial sector. 

 To begin a bear market cycle, or prolonged period of falling stock prices, the index needs to end the session at least 20 percent below its closing peak, reached in October. The Dow was down 124.98 points, or 1.09 percent, at 11,328.44, which was 20 percent below its record close on October 9, 2007. (Reporting by  Ellis Mnyandu , Editing by Kenneth Barry)
