 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Anheuser-Busch Cos Inc ( BUD.N ) had been developing a cost-cutting plan since last year, but InBev NV's INTB.BR $46.3 billion bid for the company forced it to speed up the restructuring, the chief executive of the largest U.S. beer maker said on Friday. 

 Anheuser-Busch management had started talking about slashing costs as early as February 2007, August Busch IV said during an interview with Reuters. Busch, the great-great grandson of the company's founder, became CEO in December 2006. But when rivals SABMiller Plc ( SAB.L ) and Molson Coors Brewing Co ( TAP.N ) announced plans to combine their U.S. operations last October, Busch put together a team to look at cutting $1 billion in costs over five years. When the Financial Times reported in May that InBev was getting a bid ready for Anheuser-Busch, the maker of Budweiser speeded up the process again. "We said, if this becomes real, we'd better have this thing front-loaded and we got everybody together and everybody committed to executing the things we could control on the cost side," Busch said. The company also looked at how to increase revenue more quickly in the wake of rising commodity costs, Busch said. "The old plan had gross margins and operating profit margins declining and that was totally unacceptable," Busch said. On Friday, the largest U.S. beer maker unveiled a plan it called "Blue Ocean" that it says will cut $1 billion in costs by 2010, with 75 percent occurring this year or next year. The plan was announced a day after Anheuser-Busch rejected InBev's $65-a-share offer, saying it undervalued the company. "We believe we can create much more value than the $65 a share over the course of time and we believe also that the $65 a share significantly undervalues the iconic brands that we have," said Busch, who is also the company's president. He declined to specify what Anheuser's shares should be worth, but said its new 2009 earnings-per-share forecast of $3.90, multiplied by 18 times -- the stock's multiple before the InBev offer -- suggested a $70 value even before considering the double-digit earnings increases it projects after 2009. The company will try to reach that value with a combination of job cuts through early retirement and attrition, a reduction in the number of products it sells to improve supply chain costs and attempts to pare back its reliance on natural gas and fuel oil, among other measures. While the InBev offer made Anheuser-Busch speed up the cost-cutting plan, Busch stressed the company was putting a plan in place before the offer came to light. "It's wasn't that we pulled it together in two weeks," Busch said. Anheuser-Busch shares closed up 91 cents at $62.26 on Friday on the New York Stock Exchange. (Editing by  Andre Grenon )
