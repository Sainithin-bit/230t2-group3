 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Leaders of the U.S. Senate Banking Committee on Friday warned financial regulators not to get ahead of Congress on reforming Wall Street oversight. 

 Connecticut Democrat Christopher Dodd and Alabama Republican Richard Shelby sent a letter to the Federal Reserve, the Treasury Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission inquiring about a Fed-SEC agreement being developed to share information on investment banks. Dodd chairs the banking committee and Shelby is its top Republican member. "We ask that no action regarding implementation of the (agreement) be taken before we can determine that it is in the best interests of our nation's economy and the well being of its citizens," the letter said.
