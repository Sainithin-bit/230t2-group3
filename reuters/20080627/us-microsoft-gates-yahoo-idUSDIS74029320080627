 NEW YORK (Reuters) -- Microsoft's Bill Gates told journalist Tom Brokaw he does not think a deal with Yahoo Inc was likely, CNBC reported on Friday. 

 Microsoft had sought a tie-up with Yahoo for more than a year and by early May had offered up to $47.5 billion, or $33 per share, to buy the Internet company. The software giant had hoped a Yahoo deal would accelerate its ability to capitalize on Web advertising growth and compete with Google Inc, which is increasingly fighting for the same Internet audience.   Gates is retiring from Microsoft on Friday, although he will remain the company's non- executive chairman.
