 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Package delivery company United Parcel Service Inc ( UPS.N ) expects double-digit growth in its U.S. export business to continue throughout 2008 thanks to the weak dollar, a top official said on Wednesday. 

 "U.S. exports are the only bright spot in an otherwise dark sky right now," Chief Financial Officer Kurt Kuehn told Reuters in a telephone interview. UPS also expects growth in its business between Asia and Europe to continue at robust levels and is on track to complete its $10 billion share buyback program by the end of 2009, Kuehn added.
