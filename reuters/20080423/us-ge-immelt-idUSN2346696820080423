 ERIE, Pennsylvania  (Reuters) - General Electric Co ( GE.N ) CEO Jeffrey Immelt said on Wednesday U.S. capital markets have improved since the end of the first quarter but the overall U.S. economic picture is unchanged. 

 "The capital markets are a little better" than they were at the end of March, when turmoil prompted by the near-collapse of Bear Stearns Cos Inc BSC.N made it difficult for GE to complete deals, Immelt said at the GE annual meeting. Some of these deals have now been completed, he said. GE, the second-biggest U.S. company by market value, has raised its 2008 cost-cutting goal to $3 billion from $2 billion, GE spokesman Russell Wilkerson said.
