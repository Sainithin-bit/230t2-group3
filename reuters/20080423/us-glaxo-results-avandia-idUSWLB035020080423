 LONDON  (Reuters) - GlaxoSmithKline Plc's ( GSK.L ) chief executive said on Wednesday that sales of diabetes drug Avandia had stabilized recently but it was too early to say if the business hit by safety scares would recover. 

 "In the last six to eight weeks we have seen stability in the number of prescriptions written for Avandia," Jean-Pierre Garnier told reporters in a post-results conference call. "There are some encouraging signs in terms of new patients being put on Avandia but I think at this point it is way early to say whether or not we are going to be able to turn around in a meaningful way this franchise and recoup all the patients we've lost." He also said the world's second-biggest drugmaker would continue to make acquisitions from time to time but there was no change in strategy. Glaxo agreed on Tuesday to buy U.S. biotech company Sirtris Pharmaceuticals Inc SIRT.O for $720 million. (Reporting by  Ben Hirschler )
