 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc ( AMZN.O ) warned on Wednesday that profit margins would narrow in 2008 as it kept prices in check, sending its shares down 5 percent, even as quarterly results topped Wall Street targets and the Web retailer raised its 2008 sales forecast. 

 Wall Street took the news as a sign the weak U.S. economy was forcing Amazon to keep prices low, a strategy that depresses profit margins. Gross margins, which fell below year- ago levels, have been a recurring source of investor worry as company investments, competition and now the threat of recession pressured profitability. "We think in this type of environment, externally, customers want value. That's in down times and up times," Amazon Chief Financial Officer Tom Szkutak told analysts during a conference call. "So we're going to make sure we have the right prices for customers." Concerns over weaker U.S. spending have unnerved investors of consumer companies in recent quarters and shares of Amazon, the most popular Web e-commerce site behind eBay Inc ( EBAY.O ), are down 13 percent since January 1, as of Wednesday's closing price on the Nasdaq. Szkutak dodged questions on whether the company was seeing any impact from a possible U.S. recession, simply repeating that pricing, selection and keeping items in stock were behind a broad-based, 37 percent rise in global sales. But Pacific Crest analyst Steve Weinstein said the company's more conservative profit outlook implied "some weakening of the consumer." Net income rose 30 percent to $143 million, or 34 cents per share, from $111 million, or 26 cents per share, a year earlier. Revenue rose to $4.13 billion from $3.02 billion. Analysts, on average, had been expecting earnings per share of 32 cents on revenue of $4.08 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. "It's a good revenue story, but the margins are not expanding as the more bullish people have been hoping," said Global Crown Capital analyst Martin Pyykkonen. "They are indicating they can sell more and they are selling more but presumably in here there is a lot of price competition." Operating income rose 36 percent to $198 million, on the high side of Amazon's own forecast. But as in prior quarters, impressive sales growth has come amid declining profit margins. In the first quarter, gross margins as a percentage of sales, which have declined over the previous two quarters, were 23.1 percent. That was slightly lower than the 23.8 percent a year earlier, but improved from the 20.6 percent in the fourth quarter. Amazon has been beefing up its traditional business of books and CDs with electronic media, from music downloads to the recently-launched book reader, The Kindle. Moreover, analysts believe the Seattle-based company has been luring third-party sellers to its site from eBay. For the second quarter, Amazon said sales would rise to between $3.88 billion and $4.08 billion with operating income between $120 million and $160 million. Analysts, on average, have been expecting revenues of $3.82 billion. For 2008, Amazon said it now forecasts net sales between $19.1 billion and $20 billion, with operating income between $740 million and $940 million. Wall Street, on average, has been expecting net sales of $19.3 billion. The company's previously-held 2008 forecast was for net sales of $18.75 billion to $19.75 billion and operating income between $785 million to $985 million. The discrepancy in operating income was due to stock-based compensation, intangibles and acquisitions, including its recent purchase of Audible Inc, Szkutak said. As of Tuesday's close, Amazon shares traded at 53 times projected 2008 earnings, well above the Amex Internet Index .IIX average of 20. EBay and retail giant Wal-Mart Stores Inc ( WMT.N ) are valued at 18 and 16.5 times forward-looking earnings. Amazon shares fell to $77.10 after closing on Nasdaq at $81.
