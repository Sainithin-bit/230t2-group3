 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Infineon warned the weak dollar would keep sales at best flat this quarter, but the German chipmaker's shares leapt as much as 8 percent on hopes it was close to a sale of its loss-making memory-chip business. 

 Infineon ( IFXGn.DE ) reported in-line second-quarter results at its core automotive and communications chips units on Wednesday, and said it should make an operating profit this quarter excluding memory-chip subsidiary Qimonda QI.N, which it wants to sell. Shares in Infineon rose 5.25 percent by 5:20 a.m. EDT to 5.41 euros and were the top gainer in Germany's DAX  .GDAXI  index, after the Financial Times Deutschland reported Infineon was in talks with rivals Micron MU.N, Hynix ( 000660.KS ) and Elpida 6665.T to sell its 77 percent stake in Qimonda. Traders said Infineon itself could be the target of a private equity takeover attempt. Infineon, which has said it is "evaluating its different alternatives", declined to comment. However, Chief Executive Wolfgang Ziebart told analysts on a conference call he had had no recent discussions with private equity. Two days ago Infineon announced it would take a 1 billion-euro ($1.6 billion) writedown on its stake in Qimonda. In the January-March quarter, Infineon reported earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) of 36 million euros ($58 million) excluding Qimonda and including 8 million euros in net charges, in line with market expectations. The figure compared with 65 million euros the previous quarter and a loss of 29 million euros a year earlier. Sales from continuing operations fell 4 percent quarter on quarter but rose 7 percent year on year to 1.05 billion euros. The company made a net loss of 1.371 billion euros, including its share of Qimonda's losses and the writedown. Net income from continuing operations was 19 million euros. "SLIGHT DISAPPOINTMENT" This quarter, Infineon expects sales at its loss-making communications chips unit to rise as production for advanced mobile telephony platforms ramps up, and the unit's operating loss should narrow to about 25 million euros. The German chipmaker, which supplies chips to all top five mobile phone makers, said Samsung ( 005930.KS ) had chosen an Infineon platform for its advanced third-generation HSPDA and EDGE handsets. Wireless revenues fell sharply last quarter as expected, due to "reduced volumes in certain mobile phone projects" and normal seasonal declines. At its automotive and industrial chips unit, Infineon expects sales to decline slightly this quarter as the dollar weighs and a division is deconsolidated. The unit should make an operating margin of 8.5 to 9.5 percent. "Infineon's Q3 guidance comes as a slight disappointment," Cheuvreux analyst Bernd Laux wrote in a note, adding that the second-quarter results were marginally ahead of his forecasts. DOLLAR DANGER Infineon confirmed its forecast for the fiscal year to end-September. It aims for a low to mid-single-digit EBIT margin on sales that should grow by a high single-digit percentage. But the company said it would miss its profitability target for 2008/09 if the dollar did not recover from recent lows versus the euro. The euro reached an all-time high of $1.60 on Tuesday. Infineon's Ziebart said if this rate held through next year it would cost Infineon about 120 million euros in 2009 EBIT, based on current sales projections. "Reaching 10 percent Infineon EBIT margin under such circumstances would not be possible," he said in the statement. "Against this background, we have strongly accelerated all margin improvement measures that we are implementing across the company." (Reporting by Georgina Prodhan; Editing by  Quentin Webb )
