 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Apple Inc ( AAPL.O ) beat expectations on Wednesday by posting a 36 percent rise in quarterly profit, helped by strong sales of its Macintosh computers and iPod media players. 

 COMMENTARY: ROBERT STIMPSON, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, OAK ASSOCIATES, AKRON OHIO. OWNS APPLE INC IN ROCK OAK CORE GROWTH FUND "It looks like the Macs were good, the iPods were flat and the iPhones were OK. Mac was very strong with 51 percent unit growth. It likes like the third quarter earnings view is a little below the Street. With the stock up 41 percent since the February low, it is going to take a lot of good news to propel the stock higher."
