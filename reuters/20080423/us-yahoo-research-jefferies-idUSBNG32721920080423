 (Reuters) - Jefferies & Co raised its price target on Yahoo ( YHOO.O ) to $30 from $28, saying first-quarter results may encourage Microsoft Corp ( MSFT.O ) to sweeten its bid for a quick and friendly deal. 

 Earlier on Wednesday, Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer said the company is standing by its $44 billion bid for Yahoo. The brokerage, which kept its "buy" rating on the stock, said Yahoo's slightly better than expected first-quarter results suggest slow but steady progress in Display and Search, while the weak affiliate business continues to dampen overall growth. Jefferies said Microsoft will still have to raise its bid, noting the current price fails to reflect $1 billion to $2 billion in cost synergies and the possibility for management to meet its three-year stated growth of more than 20 percent and margins of 42 percent. Scarcity value of Yahoo as the only global platform and premium brand that could make Microsoft a viable competitor to Google Inc ( GOOG.O ) will also be factor in raising the bid, the brokerage added. Yahoo shares, which closed at $28.54 Tuesday, were trading down at $28.19 before the bell Wednesday on Nasdaq. (Reporting by Jennifer Robin Raj in Bangalore; Editing by  Bernard Orr )
