 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Health insurer WellPoint Inc ( WLP.N ) on Wednesday said first-quarter profit slumped on high medical costs, including in its Medicare plans for the elderly, and further cut its 2008 forecast. 

 Net income fell to $588.1 million, or $1.07 per share, from $783.1 million, or $1.26 per share, a year earlier. WellPoint, the largest U.S. health insurer by membership, in March sharply cut its first-quarter and full-year forecasts, sparking a broad sell-off across the industry. Shares of the Indianapolis-based company are off about 47 percent in 2008, compared with a 36 percent drop for the Morgan Stanley Healthcare Payor index .HMO.
