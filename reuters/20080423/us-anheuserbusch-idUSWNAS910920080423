 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Anheuser-Busch Cos Inc ( BUD.N ) reported lower quarterly profit on Wednesday, hurt by falling U.S. demand for beers like Budweiser and Michelob and slimmer profits from its stake in Mexican brewer Grupo Modelo 

  ( GMODELOC.MX ). But per-share earnings, boosted by a lower share count, rose and matched Wall Street's expectations, according to Reuters Estimates. The brewer said first-quarter net income fell to $510.9 million from $517.5 million a year before. By contrast, earnings per share rose to 71 cents from 67 cents. Equity income, or earnings from Anheuser's ownership stakes in foreign brewers such as Modelo and China's Tsingtao ( 600600.SS ), fell 21 percent, as higher operating and materials costs squeezed profits at Modelo, which makes Corona beer and is half-owned by Anheuser. Quarterly net sales rose 6 percent to $4.10 billion. The St. Louis-based brewer sold 38.5 million barrels of beer in the quarter, up more than 2 percent from 37.6 million barrels a year earlier. The biggest increases involved the international brands and overseas sales. In Anheuser's home market of the United States, beer volume only rose 0.4 percent, while revenue per barrel rose 2.3 percent following price increases on most products that went into effect in late 2007 and early 2008. U.S. sales from wholesalers to retailers, a better indicator of consumer demand, were down 0.7 percent. Excluding the impact of imported brands such as Stella Artois and Corona, sales to retailers would have been down 1.4 percent. The results indicate "a U.S. operating environment that is on balance worse than we had anticipated," said Goldman Sachs analyst Judy Hong, citing the weak sales to retailers and revenue per barrel growth which fell short of her expectations. Furthermore, Hong said she is concerned about future profit margins in the U.S. beer business, given soaring costs for commodities like grain and fuel and the need for Anheuser to spend more on marketing to drive sales of its core brands. TROUBLE AT HOME Anheuser, which controls about half of the U.S. beer market, faces a host of challenges, including a shift in U.S. consumer tastes away from traditional domestic beer toward wine, spirits, foreign beers and small-batch "craft" beers. That has prompted Anheuser to invest in foreign brewers and strike up distribution deals with the likes of InBev NV INTB.BR, Grolsch GROLc.AS and Hansen Natural Corp HANS.O. Such deals have added brands like Corona, Stella Artois, Beck's and even Monster energy drinks to Anheuser's portfolio, giving it a source of growth as its core brands have stagnated. The company has recently vowed to turn around its core business, and is hoping to reignite sales with the upcoming launch of Bud Light Lime, in time for beer's key summer season. But Credit Suisse analyst Carlos Laboy recently called the lime-flavored lager a "me-too" product that imitates the taste of SABMiller Plc's ( SAB.L ) Miller Chill, the look of Corona and the positioning of other established products. Bear Stearns analyst Justin Hott said the peak summer months will be the big test for Anheuser, whose core business, he said, is showing no signs of recovery. "The best hope for BUD investors is a takeout of the company," Hott said, adding that management seems unwilling to accept such a move. "Therefore, we expect BUD to remain cheap." Anheuser shares currently trade at 15.6 times earnings estimates for the current year, a discount to rival Molson Coors Brewing Co ( TAP.N ), which has a multiple of 16.1, and its peers on the Dow Jones U.S. Beverages Index .DJUSBV, which have an average price-to-earnings multiple of 18.1. Anheuser had 721.6 million shares outstanding as of March 31, when the latest quarter ended, down from 773.3 million a year before. Anheuser shares were up 36 cents at $47.76 on the New York Stock Exchange. (Reporting by Martinne Geller, editing by Gerald E. McCormick and Dave Zimmerman)
