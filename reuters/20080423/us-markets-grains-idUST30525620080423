 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - U.S. rice futures rose to a fresh all-time high on Wednesday on worries about supply shortages that have triggered political unrest and export restrictions designed to protect dwindling domestic stocks. 

 U.S. soybean futures were higher as well, while wheat prices fell 4 percent on prospects for a large global crop in 2008. On the Chicago Board of Trade, July rough rice futures hit a record high of $24.85 per hundredweight and stood 56 cents higher, or 2.3 percent, at $24.76 as of 12:40 a.m. EDT. Spot rice prices are up about 80 percent so far in 2008. "Some of the main rice producing countries have imposed export curbs ... and this has combined with low global stocks to drive rice higher," said Kenji Kobayashi, a grains analyst at Kanetsu Asset Management in Tokyo. "Rice has been hitting successive records. It's neared $25 and I think $30 is now on our horizon," Kobayashi said. Trade bans have been put in place by India, the world's second-largest rice exporter in 2007, and Vietnam, the third-biggest, in the hopes of cooling domestic prices of the staple food. Thailand is the largest exporter. The export curbs have been criticized by the Asian Development Bank, which said Asian governments were overreacting to surging food prices by resorting to market-distorting measures.  Supply worries were starting to emerge in the United States as well. Wal-Mart Stores Inc's ( WMT.N ) Sam's Club warehouse division on Wednesday said it was limiting sales of Jasmine, Basmati and long-grain white rice "due to recent supply and demand trends." The news came a day after Costco Wholesale Corp ( COST.O ), the largest U.S. warehouse club operator, said it had seen increased demand for items like rice and flour as customers, worried about global food shortages, stock up. Sam's Club said it is limiting sales of the rice to four bags per customer per visit. SOYBEANS ADVANCE CBOT soybean futures rallied on concerns about labor unrest in Argentina that were raising demand for dwindling supplies of U.S. soy. Argentina is the world's largest exporter of soymeal and soyoil, and No. 2 in soybean exports. CBOT soybeans for May delivery were up 7-1/4 cents at $13.82 per bushel. "We've got (virtually) zero beans left in the United States, and as long as this problem down in Argentina continues, the more business America is going to have to do on the world market," said Iowa Grain analyst Gavin Maguire. Argentine President Cristina Fernandez on Tuesday called for calm as talks with farm leaders grew more tense, raising expectations in financial markets that farmers might go back on strike on May 2.  CBOT wheat prices were pressured by ideas of a large world wheat harvest starting in the Northern Hemisphere in less than two months. "The idea that we have a global crop that is looking pretty decent, coming down the line -- that is trumping everything else right now," Maguire said. CBOT May soft red winter wheat was down 35-3/4 cents, or 4.2 percent, at $8.16 per bushel. China's top wheat growing provinces of Henan and Shandong are likely to have a bumper winter wheat harvest following recent rains, the Xinhua news agency said, quoting local agricultural authorities. Wheat planting got off to a strong start in Western Australia this week after good rain, although eastern areas need moisture.  Meanwhile, India's agriculture minister said a record harvest and bulging government stocks will rule out wheat imports this year.  CBOT corn prices were flat, with May down 3/4 cent at $5.93-1/2 per bushel.
