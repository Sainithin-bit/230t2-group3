 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Ambac Financial Group Inc ABK.N, a bond insurer that struggled to raise capital last month, posted a surprisingly wide quarterly loss on Wednesday after recording $3.1 billion in charges, and its stock plummeted 43 percent. 

 The first-quarter loss of $1.66 billion, which wiped out nearly 40 percent of Ambac's shareholder equity, gave new ammunition to long-time critics of the company who believe it will need to raise more capital to keep its top credit ratings as the mortgage market deteriorates. Raising capital with such a low share price -- the stock closed at $3.46 on Wednesday -- would be difficult for the world's No. 2 bond insurer. The huge loss also shook confidence in larger rival MBIA Inc ( MBI.N ), which reports earnings next month, sending its shares down 34 percent. "What a disaster," said Josh Rosner, managing director at consulting firm Graham Fisher & Co and a long-time skeptic of bond insurers. Michael Callen, Ambac's chief executive, said when the dust settles, the company will not have missed a single principal or interest payment. "I'm absolutely certain," Callen said on a conference call. But investors were not so sure, sending Ambac shares to a record low. Since May 2007, the stock has fallen 97 percent. The cost of protecting obligations of Ambac's main insurance unit, Ambac Assurance Corp, against default surged to a record high Wednesday. Ambac is suffering after having insured subprime mortgage bonds and other risky assets that left it with billions of dollars of expected losses. Ambac posted a first-quarter loss of $1.66 billion, or $11.69 a share, compared with year-earlier net income of $213.3 million, or $2.02 a share. The bottom line was not the only bad news for Ambac. It reiterated it was not winning much new business. Credit enhancement production, which measures the total expected value of business written during the quarter, was $40.5 million, down 87 percent. Ambac, which insures $511 billion in debt, said on a conference call it is in violation of one of the terms of an unused bank line. It said it will discuss ways to fix that problem with banks. Although supporters of Ambac have long argued that many of the write-downs it was recording would ultimately be reversed, the company recorded an impairment charge of $940.4 million on several credit derivatives known as "asset-backed security collateralized debt obligations." Ambac also set aside $1.04 billon for expected losses on mortgage-related securities. These are not expected to be reversed. MORE CAPITAL? CEO Callen said the company has enough capital by Standard & Poor's current reckoning, and should have enough to meet Moody's Investors Service's targets in the second quarter. Write-downs do not necessarily affect capital levels that regulators and ratings agencies look at. Whether the company now has to raise more capital depends in large part on the judgment of rating agencies, in particular Moody's and S&P. Both agencies said in March that Ambac had more than enough capital to meet its expected losses, when they affirmed the top ratings of the company's main insurance unit after Ambac raised $1.5 billion. Both agencies' models incorporated deterioration in the mortgage market. Fears that the agencies would strip Ambac Assurance Corp of its top ratings sank the U.S. stock market, beginning in January, amid fears that investors would be forced to sell billions of dollars of insured bonds. Top credit ratings are crucial for Ambac's winning new business, but both Moody's and S&P said they may still cut Ambac Assurance's ratings over the next few years. Many institutional investors can only hold bonds with "triple-A" ratings from both Moody's and S&P, and a downgrade could force them to sell the assets. Fitch stripped Ambac Assurance of its top ratings in January. The first-quarter results were weak enough to erase $980 million, or 40 percent, of Ambac's shareholders' equity. Excluding mark-to-market losses but including impairment charges and increases in reserves, Ambac's loss was $6.93 per share, far higher than the average analyst estimate of a loss of $1.82 a share and a sharp reversal from operating profit of $2 a share a year ago. The stock closed down $2.57 to $3.46 after falling as low as $3.08 on the New York Stock Exchange.
