 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Schering-Plough Corp SGP.N said on Wednesday its first-quarter earnings fell, as the company took charges for its recent acquisition of Organon Biosciences. 

 The drugmaker earned $253 million, or 15 cents per share, compared with $543 million, or 36 cents per share, in the year-earlier period. (Reporting by Ransdell Pierson; Editing by  Derek Caney )
