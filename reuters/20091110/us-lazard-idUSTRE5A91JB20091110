 (Reuters) - Investment bank Lazard's board may pick more than one person to lead the company following the death of Chief Executive Bruce Wasserstein, the New York Post said. 

 Interim CEO Steve Golub may be made chairman and Ken Jacobs named as CEO, the paper cited a source as saying, adding that Vice Chairman Gary Parr could also get a leadership role. Lazard is not expected to announce Wasserstein's successor for another two weeks as no final decision has been made, the paper cited a source as saying. Lazard could not immediately be reached for comment outside regular U.S. business hours. (Reporting by Supantha Mukherjee in Bangalore; Editing by Greg Mahlich)
