 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Home prices fell in the third quarter from year-ago levels in about 80 percent of U.S. metropolitan areas, the National Association of Realtors said on Tuesday. 

 The industry trade group said median prices fell compared to a year earlier in 123 of 153 metro areas, while 30 areas saw prices rise. The national median price for single-family homes, which make up the bulk of the U.S. housing market, fell 11.2 percent from the same quarter a year earlier to $177,900. (Reporting by  Corbett B.
