 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd has released draft legislation to overhaul financial regulation. 

 The 1,136-page document calls for bold changes beyond what the Obama administration and House of Representatives have proposed. Here are some of the key proposals: CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION AGENCY: * Backs Obama proposal to create agency to regulate credit cards, mortgages, other financial products * Strips consumer protection duties from existing agencies, including Federal Reserve, Comptroller of the Currency, Office of Thrift Supervision, Federal Deposit Insurance Corp, National Credit Union Administration, Federal Trade Commission. * Lets states pass tougher consumer protections, preventing federal regulations from preempting stronger state laws. FINANCIAL STABILITY AGENCY * New agency to police systemic risk in economy. * Agency to discourage firms from getting too large by imposing burdens on them as they grow. * Would empower regulators to break up large, complex companies if they pose a threat to U.S. financial stability NEW SUPER BANK REGULATOR * New Financial Institutions Regulatory Administration (FIRA) would have a board including FDIC chairman, Fed chairman, three presidential appointees. * Office of Thrift Supervision and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency would be abolished. * FIRA would strip FDIC and Fed of direct supervisory and regulatory powers over banks and bank holding companies. RESOLUTION AUTHORITY TO UNWIND TROUBLED FINANCIAL FIRMS * FDIC would have primary authority to dismantle troubled financial giants, while SEC would have similar authority over systemically important broker-dealers. * Cost of unwinding a troubled firm would be recouped after rescues through assessments on other financial firms. REGULATION OF OVER-THE-COUNTER DERIVATIVES * Requires central clearing and exchange trading for derivatives that can be cleared and provides a role for both regulators and clearinghouses to determine which contracts should be cleared. * Swaps not cleared through a central clearinghouse or traded on exchanges subjected to margin, capital requirements. * All trades to be reported so that regulators can monitor potential risks. HEDGE FUNDS * Advisers to hedge funds worth over $100 million will be required to register with SEC, with advisers giving information about trades and portfolios to regulators. * States could supervise investment advisers who manage $100 million or less in assets. That increases threshold from the current $25 million. INSURANCE * Creates office within Treasury Department to monitor insurance industry, coordinate international issues. CREDIT RATING AGENCIES * Establishes SEC Office of Credit Rating Agencies. * Sets new rules for internal controls, independence, transparency and penalties for poor performance. * Allows investors to sue ratings agencies for "a knowing or reckless failure to investigate or to obtain analysis from an independent source."
