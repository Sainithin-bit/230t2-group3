 BOSTON  (Reuters) - Textron Inc ( TXT.N ), the world's largest maker of corporate jets, forecast 2009 profit far below analysts' expectations due to the weak economy, sending shares down 27 percent on Thursday. 

 The diversified U.S. manufacturer also reported a $209 million fourth-quarter net loss after hefty charges to exit most of its finance businesses, though the results topped consensus forecasts. The corporate jet business has been particularly hard-hit by the downturn. Jets have become something of a symbol of corporate excess after U.S. lawmakers last year chastised Detroit's top auto executives for flying private jets to Washington to ask for federal bailout money. Citigroup Inc ( C.N ) canceled an order for a $50 million aircraft on Tuesday, amid allegations of lavish spending after receiving $45 billion from the U.S. government last year. General Motors Corp ( GM.N ) and Chrysler LLC CBS.UL are barred from operating corporate jets as part of their bailout. Textron shares were down $3.65 or 27.4 percent at $9.67, their lowest level in a decade, on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday morning. "Economic conditions continued to weaken during the fourth quarter," Lewis Campbell, Textron's CEO, said in a statement. He added that the company was cutting production plans and reducing capital spending as it focuses on protecting cash flow. Textron looks for 2009 profit of $1 to $1.50 per share from continuing operations and before charges. That is well below the $2.35 per share that analysts on average expected, according to Reuters Estimates. The company, which also makes Bell helicopters, EZ-Go golf carts and military vehicles, forecast a 12 percent drop in revenue. Merrill Lynch analyst Ronald Epstein called the outlook "especially bleak" in a note to clients. The fourth-quarter loss came to 87 cents per share, compared with last year's net income of $256 million or $1 per share. The results included $526 million in charges from the company's pullback from finance. Excluding charges, profit came to 40 cents per share, topping the 35-cent Wall Street consensus, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue for the quarter inched up 0.4 percent to $3.61 billion. The Providence, Rhode Island-based company said in December it would exit all finance business not directly related to its manufacturing operations. Textron shares have lost about 75 percent of their value over the past year, a steeper slide than the 45 percent fall of the Standard & Poor's capital goods industry index .GSPIC. Textron's competitors in corporate jets include Canada's Bombardier Inc ( BBDb.TO ), the Gulfstream unit of General Dynamics Corp ( GD.N ) and France's Dassault Aviation ( AVMD.PA ).
