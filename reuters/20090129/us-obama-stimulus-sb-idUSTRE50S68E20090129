 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - President Barack Obama will continue to seek Republican support for his economic recovery plan as the Senate prepares to consider it next week, White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said on Thursday. 

 "My presumption is that we will pick up support on both sides of the aisles on this," Gibbs said after the bill was passed by the House of Representatives on Wednesday night without the support of a single Republican. Gibbs also said Obama would discuss the scale of the stimulus plan during his meeting with Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner later on Thursday. (Reporting by  Ross Colvin )
