 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - No. 1 U.S. trucking company YRC Worldwide Inc ( YRCW.O ) on Thursday reported a fourth quarter net loss, citing the impact of the slowing U.S. economy and impairment charges. 

 The Overland Park, Kansas-based company reported a fourth-quarter net loss of $244.4 million, or $4.14 a share, compared with a net loss of $735.8 million, or $12.99 a share, a year earlier. Excluding impairment charges related to a write-down of goodwill related to the trade names of two regional trucking units -- which were integrated last year under a single brand -- and a write-down of goodwill at its YRC Logistics unit, the company posted a loss of $2.51 a share. The year ago net loss included a charge of nearly $800 million. "Our results reflect the significance of the economic recession that has been longer and deeper than anyone anticipated," Chief Executive Bill Zollars said in a statement "Although we were not pleased with this level of performance, it was consistent with our internal expectations and those of our banking group." YRC is in discussions with its lenders on its debt covenants and Zollars said "discussions with the banks are progressing well, and we are on track to finalize an amendment by mid-February." The company reported revenue for the quarter of $1.93 billion, down from $2.35 billion a year earlier. Analysts had expected revenue for the quarter of $2.0 billion.
