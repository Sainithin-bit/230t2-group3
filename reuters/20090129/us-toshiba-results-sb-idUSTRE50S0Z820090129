 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japan's Toshiba Corp ( 6502.T ) tumbled to a quarterly loss and warned it would post its first annual operating loss in seven years for the year to March due mainly to its struggling chip business as demand wanes. 

 Toshiba, the world's No. 2 maker of NAND flash memory behind Samsung Electronics Co ( 005930.KS ), reported an operating loss of 158.8 billion yen ($1.76 billion) for October-December, against a profit of 42.1 billion yen a year earlier. It slashed its annual earnings forecast and warned it may report an operating loss of 280 billion yen in the year to March, compared with its previous forecast for a 150 billion yen profit. Analysts on average expect a full year operating loss of 67.5 billion yen, according to a poll of 16 brokerages by Reuters Estimates. The global chip sector has been battered by a near two-year downturn caused by chronic oversupply, tumbling prices and weak demand for personal computers and other electronics gadgets. Toshiba's digital products segment was also hit by the slump in demand. Toshiba shares dropped 19 percent in the three months that ended in December. The benchmark Nikkei average  .N225  fell 21 percent in the same period. (Reporting by Sachi Izumi; Editing by  Anshuman Daga )
