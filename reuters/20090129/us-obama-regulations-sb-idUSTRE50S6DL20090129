 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The White House said on Thursday it would have more information "soon" on financial stability, housing and plans for new regulations for the financial industry. 

 "I think the American people understand that we have to deal with and the president also understands that we have to deal with each of these to move the economy forward," White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said. "You have a recovery reinvestment plan, which is moving through Congress, you have a financial stability package and you have financial reregulation," he said. Asked about the upcoming G20 meeting, Gibbs said all countries should work together to deal with the global financial crisis.
