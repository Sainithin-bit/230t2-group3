 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japan's Nintendo Co Ltd 7974.OS posted a 21 percent gain in quarterly operating profit on brisk demand for its Wii video game console and DS handheld game player, but it cut its forecast due to a stronger yen. 

 Nintendo booked strong sales for both the Wii and DS in the year-end holiday shopping season, proving itself relatively resilient to a global economic slowdown that has slammed rival electronics firms. But Nintendo's outlook is tempered by a rising yen, which makes its consoles less competitive and cuts into the value of overseas earnings. Nintendo gets more than three-quarters of its sales outside Japan. The company, locked in a three-way battle with Microsoft Corp's ( MSFT.O ) XBox and Sony Corp's ( 6758.T ) PlayStation in the video game market, lowered its forecast for the year to end-March to 530 billion yen from a previous 630 billion yen estimate. The new forecast compares with a market consensus for 604 billion yen in a poll of 18 analysts by Reuters Estimates. Nintendo had been widely expected to trim its outlook given that it was based on dollar/yen and euro/yen assumptions of 100 and 140, respectively. The dollar is currently fetching about 89 yen, while the European currency is trading around 118 yen. October-December group operating profit rose to 249.2 billion from 205.3 billion yen a year earlier and compared with an average of 247.9 billion yen from four analysts surveyed by Reuters. Shares in Nintendo have lost 43 percent over the past 6 months through Wednesday, slightly underperforming the Nikkei average  .N225 , which fell 39 percent. Prior to the announcement, Nintendo's stock closed up 1.6 percent at 32,300 yen. The Nikkei rose 1.8 percent. (Reporting by  Nathan Layne , editing by Ian Geoghegan)
