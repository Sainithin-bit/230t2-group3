 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The number of U.S. workers filing new claims for jobless benefits rose 3,000 last week, data on Thursday showed, while so-called continued claims hit the highest level on record as a year-long recession chilled employment. 

 Initial claims for state unemployment insurance benefits increased to a seasonally adjusted 588,000 in the week ended Jan 24 from a revised 585,000 the prior week, the Labor Department said. Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast 580,000 new claims versus a previously reported count of 589,000 the week before. (Reporting by  Alister Bull , Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)
