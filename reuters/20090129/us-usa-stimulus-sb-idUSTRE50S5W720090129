 (Reuters) - The Senate will consider next week a nearly $900 billion package of tax cuts and spending programs that are aimed at pulling the economy out of its downward spiral. 

 Here's what is expected to happen next: * Senators will offer amendments to change the legislation, which could include adding tax breaks and either redistributing or slicing out spending plans. * These amendments could include proposals that would give tax breaks for companies that repatriate profits held overseas and for others to expand homeownership. Lawmakers could seek to remove language for programs like $400 million to help prevent sexually transmitted diseases. * Republicans could seek to use procedural mechanisms such as lengthy debate -- a filibuster -- to slow or block the stimulus package. To end debate, Democrats would need to seek a vote on cloture, which requires approval of three-fifths of the Senate -- 60 senators. This would clear the way for a vote on the bill. * If the Senate approves the legislation, it will need to be reconciled with the different version that passed the House of Representatives. A group of lawmakers from each chamber will be appointed by party leaders to resolve the differences. * Once a compromise is reached, the House and Senate would again have to vote on the final version before it could be sent to President Barack Obama for his signature or veto.
