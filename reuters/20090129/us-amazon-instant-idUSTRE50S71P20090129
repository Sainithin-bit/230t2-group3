 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Online retailer Amazon.com Inc on Thursday posted a higher-than-expected quarterly profit and an 18 percent revenue rise, helped by market share gains during the holiday season. 

 Shares in the firm rose 8 percent. COMMENTARY: TODD LEONE, HEAD OF LISTED TRADING, COWEN & CO "It's a stock that's very visible. Whenever a company like Amazon pulls earnings, it's great for the market. "The consumer is still spending a little bit or they have their act together, and they're managing their company really well." HAMED KHORSAND, ANALYST, BWS FINANCIAL "The top line was very strong. "Everything looked very positive. On the bottom line, it looks like it got a boost from a lower tax rate than what the company guided to in the past... Looks like tax rate might have helped them on the net income line. "Gross margin wasn't as great as we would have liked it, but it was still decent enough and you can't dispute that the company did very well on the top line. Gross margin "was a little weaker than what I had modeled, but again, they did very well on the top line to justify the discounting. "It would be too early to say if they gained share, but they definitely grew faster than what industry reports were suggesting that online sales grew by. You can assume that they did gain share just from that data point." JEFFREY LINDSAY, ANALYST, BERNSTEIN RESEARCH "It's very good, far better than everyone was expecting in revenue terms, margin terms, in EPS. And the guidance is above what people were expecting. "It looks like they took a lot of market share and made substantial gains. Now it seems like eBay was relatively disappointing and the read we took from eBay turned out to be pessimistic. The good thing is that Amazon hasn't had to discount to the extent that people feared to achieve this."
