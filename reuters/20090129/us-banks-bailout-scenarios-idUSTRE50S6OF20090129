 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. policy-makers are mulling whether the government should warehouse failing Wall Street investments in a bank cleanup program some analysts estimate could reach $4 trillion. 

 This "bad bank" would soak up mortgage securities and other investments weighing down banks' balance sheets and clogging credit markets. The program would be costly and cumbersome but officials might have no other choice as the financial crisis worsens. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said this week a plan to fix the financial system will be ready "relatively soon". Below are scenarios on how such a program might work: BAD BANK OR GUARANTEE? - The new entity would become a way-station for hard-to-price assets or simply protect banks from hard-to-gauge but possibly catastrophic losses. Another option, and one that could complement a bad bank, would be to offer a federal guarantee on losses caused by bad investments, which would be cheaper than buying the assets outright. That option, however, would not scrub bank balance sheets, which might scare off badly needed private capital. HOW TO PRICE IT? -- A key challenge is how to value bad assets. If the government pays too much, taxpayers will take a hit. Too little and banks will suffer crippling losses on their own. Geithner has said that Washington could infer a value from the markets, use outside models or take a cue from bank regulators. Basically, this would be an imprecise science. FUNDING? -- Ostensibly, Washington has more than $350 billion left in a financial rescue fund that it could use to jump-start a financial rescue program, but some of that money has already been promised. Still, a share of that Troubled Asset Relief Program could be used to backstop failing loans and Congress could give the program a top-up. Alternatively, seed money could come from the Treasury-run TARP, with the Federal Reserve standing by if more funds are needed. If the government were to decide to offer an asset guarantee, it could channel the money through the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., a regulator already tasked with winding down failed banks. If policy-makers decide to buy the assets outright to scrub the banks' balance sheets, the total cost could reach several trillion dollars. WHO RUNS IT? -- The FDIC has for years disposed of failed lenders and could use that expertise to oversee a 'bad bank.' The Fed and Treasury have worked in tandem through the credit crisis to soothe the markets using taxpayer money and the central bank's balance sheet. Either approach might work or a new entity could be created as happened during the savings and loan crisis of the late 1980s. HOW LONG? -- Former Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson scratched plans for a 'bad bank,' partly because it would have taken too long to establish. The Fed has needed months to set up some of its emergency credit programs. While the markets might initially cheer news of a 'bad bank,' it would likely take months to get the program up and running, and during that time more loans may sour if the economy worsens. INVESTOR STAKE? -- The main goal of any rescue is to restore credit markets and boost banks' capital reserves. Policy-makers could send a signal that federal aid is meant to encourage private investors to put money into Wall Street banks so that the healthy portion can resume normal lending.
