 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - President Barack Obama's push to curb executive compensation deemed excessive aims to reassure taxpayers worrying that the money used to bail out Wall Street might be going to big bonuses. 

 Wall Street's reputation among the American public is extremely poor; financiers are blamed for a housing mess that is a major reason the U.S. economy is sinking. A front-page story in The New York Times on Thursday underscored the concern. The paper reported that employees at financial companies in New York collected an estimated $18.4 billion in bonuses last year. Just this week it was disclosed that Citigroup, the beneficiary of some $50 billion in taxpayer bailout money, was on the cusp of buying a $50 million corporate jet, only to cancel the deal under pressure from Washington. Americans are experiencing bailout fatigue, as they watch their government dole out billions of dollars to save companies that are at least in part to blame for the economic calamity, but do not seem to show a sense of remorse. Obama needs the trust of the American people to keep pursuing a bailout of companies and banks and keep the economy from completely disintegrating. His vow to get tough on executive pay -- "outrageous" was the word White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said the president had used -- aimed to give Americans some measure of confidence that the government is acting in their best interest. "Whether it's government or the financial system, we're not going to be able to do what is needed to be done to stabilize our financial system if the American people read about this type of outrageous behavior," Gibbs said.
