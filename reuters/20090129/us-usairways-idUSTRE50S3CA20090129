 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - US Airways Group ( LCC.N ) on Thursday said its quarterly net loss widened as it wrote down lost value of its fuel hedges. 

 The airline said its fourth-quarter net loss was $541 million, or $4.74 per share, compared with a loss of $79 million, or 87 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items totaling $321 million, the company reported a loss of $220 million, or $1.93 per share. That compares with Wall Street forecasts for $2.15 per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Special charges in the fourth quarter 2008 included $234 million of losses resulting from mark-to-market adjustments on fuel hedging instruments. US Airways said its revenue fell 0.6 percent to $2.76 billion. (Reporting by Kyle Peterson)
