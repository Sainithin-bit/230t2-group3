 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Vice President Joe Biden said on Thursday the economic stimulus package working its way through Congress is good, but will improve and attract Republican votes. 

 "Could it be better? When you have two branches of government and three separate entities working on something, I'm not sure it could have gotten at this stage much better than it is," Biden told CNBC. "I think it's good. I think you'll see it get better and I also think you'll see Republicans voting for it," he said. (Reporting by  Tim Ahmann )
