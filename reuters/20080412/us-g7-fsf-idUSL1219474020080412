 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The world's industrialized powers urged banks on Friday to come clean quickly and clearly on losses incurred since the credit boom of recent years went belly-up last August. 

 Banks, investors and credit rating agencies grossly underestimated the risks behind a credit boom where use of debt derivatives and mortgage-backed securities blossomed under sloppy management and weak supervision, and fraudulent practice at times, said a report by the Financial Stability Forum, approved by G7 finance ministers and central banks. "We strongly encourage financial institutions to make robust risk disclosures in their upcoming mid-year reporting consistent with leading disclosure practices as set out in the FSF report," G7 finance ministers and central bankers said in a statement, noting that it had been approved by all at the meeting. The FSF issued a long list of recommendations for short- and long-term reforms in response to the paralysis which has plagued markets since the U.S subprime mortgage crisis snowballed eight months ago. Government oversight was lacking too, the FSF forum said in a 75-page report, which proposed raising capital requirements and beefing up other aspects of financial market behavior in a bid to restore confidence in the short and long term. "Market participants severely underestimated default risks, concentration risks, market risks and liquidity risks," it said. The FSF proposed raising the capital requirements of the so-called Basel II accord for certain complex structured credit products and adding new requirements for default and event risk on banks' trading books. Noting this should happen over time so as to not add to current stress, it also recommended strengthening the capital treatment of liquidity facilities to off-balance sheet conduits. In terms of short-term action, one proposal the FSF floated was for banks and other financial institutions to report fast and fully on the damage and risks they incurred. "We also said that within 100 days firms should strengthen their risk management practices and stress testing," European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet said in comments to journalists after the G7 meeting of finance ministers and central bank chiefs. Looking back at the genesis of the crisis, the FSF said the boom in certain types of securitized instruments had been poorly understood by many and standards slipped. The downturn in the U.S. housing market and a sudden rise in delinquencies in the U.S. sub-prime mortgage sector in 2007 provided the wake-up call after three years or so of poor-quality underwriting and in cases fraudulent practice, it said. "The demand for high-yielding assets and low default rates also encouraged a loosening of credit standards, most glaringly in the U.S. subprime mortgage market, but more broadly in standards and terms of loans to households and businesses, including loans for buy-outs by private equity firms. "Here too, banks, investors and CRAs (credit ratings agencies) misjudged the level of risks, particularly these instruments' common exposure to broad factors such as a weakening housing market or a fall in the market liquidity of high-yield corporate debt," it said. On the headache of valuations in the longer term, the FSF said: "Investors, industry representatives and auditors should meet together, on a semi-annual basis, to discuss the key risks faced by the financial sector and to identify the types of risk disclosures that would be most relevant and useful to investors at that time. "Regulators, supervisors and standard setters should be consulted with respect to the above efforts. A more prescriptive approach by securities market regulators, bank supervisors or accounting standard setters may prove necessary if this market-led approach proves inadequate." International accounting standards bodies will strengthen rules to achieve better disclosure on valuations, methodologies and the uncertainty associated with valuations, the FSF said. It also singled out ratings agencies for criticism, citing potential conflicts of interest as well as flawed rating methods. "One of the important triggers of the current turmoil was the precipitous decline in confidence in ratings of structured credit products. "After assigning high ratings to subprime-related RMBSs and CDOs between 2004 and 2007, and thus contributing to the phenomenal growth of subprime lending, since mid-2007 CRAs have announced an inordinate number of rapid multi-notch downgrades of these instruments." "Additional measures must be taken to improve internal governance, enhance transparency about the rating practices, and ensure compliance with relevant Codes of Conduct." Of particular interest was the fact that currently many rating agencies did not publish verifiable and easily comparable historical performance data regarding their ratings. (Editing by Jan Dahinten)
