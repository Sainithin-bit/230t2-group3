 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - President Bush on Friday unveiled plans for the government to help some struggling subprime mortgage borrowers avoid foreclosure. 

 He also warned it is not the government's job to bail out speculators.  COMMENTS: MARK VITNER, AN ECONOMIST At WACHOVIA SECURITIES IN CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA: "In terms of the President's proposals, they are really aimed at helping out the victims of some of the mortgage abuses, while not providing any relief at all of substance to the perpetuators of the problem." JEFF SCHAPPE, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, BB&T ASSET MANAGEMENT, RALEIGH, NORTH CAROLINA: "It's very light on detail and limited in scope. He is proposing to revitalize recommendations he made six month ago to Congress. He is putting it essentially in the lap of Congress. It would allow some delinquent borrowers to get an FHA guarantee so that can refinance. I suspect it's going to be limited to borrowers in a primary residence who are significantly delinquent." "The important news today is that Bernanke is saying the Fed is going to do whatever it will take to limit the impact." AXEL MERK, PORTFOLIO MANAGER AT THE MERK HARD CURRENCY FUND IN PALO ALTO, CALIFORNIA: "What Bush's plan will do is make poor homeowners slaves of their homes. If you can't afford a reset in interest rates when you have been paying 1 to 8 percent, you might be able to get by when the rate is set to 3 or 4 percent. But the terms of the loan will require that you basically never pay down your loan. Unless they are bailed out by higher home prices, they are becoming prisoners of their homes." "And home prices cannot bail them out as lending standards tighten. If a bubble is not allowed to deflate, you make matters worse." BILL HORNBARGER, CHIEF FIXED-INCOME STRATEGIST AT A.G. EDWARDS & SONS IN ST. LOUIS: "To the extent that it helps calm the markets down obviously it's good. The biggest impact we're seeing today in the news is in credit spreads. Credit spreads are coming in nicely. I think it's just another thing that inspires confidence and helps liquidity a little bit." "It's inspiring a little bit of confidence in the markets, which is helping credit spreads and equities a little bit, taking some of the flight bid out of the Treasury market. "(The "speculators" comment means) You're not going to see huge issuance to fund a giant, massive bailout." DIXON FUNG, HEAD OF CURRENCY TRADING AT MG FINANCIAL IN NEW YORK: "Basically, it's no bailout -- both Bernanke and Bush are making it clear. Stocks are paring their gains a bit too."
