 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc has tentatively set a mid-September target for the launch of its music service, the New York Post reported in its online edition on Friday, citing sources familiar with the situation. 

 The store will offer songs in the MP3 format and give consumers an alternative to Apple Inc's iTunes, the report said. Amazon had said in the spring that it would launch a digital music store by the end of the year. Amazon officials were not immediately available for comment. (Reporting by  Lewis Krauskopf )
