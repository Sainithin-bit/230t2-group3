 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - The California power grid manager on Friday was more relaxed but still wary of possible problems on the huge transmission lines that carry 80 percent of the state's electricity. The end of the hottest work week in 2007 was expected to lend some relief to the grid as businesses close a few hours early for the Labor Day weekend. "We don't want to relax too much," said Gregg Fishman, spokesman for the California Independent System Operator. "We expect (demand) to go down. But it may not." The Cal ISO for Friday -- for the third straight day -- set restrictions on utilities' maintenance of plants and power lines to ensure grid reliability. California officials and utilities praised Thursday's conservation efforts as the key factor in avoiding mandatory cuts to some businesses. The peak load on Thursday -- 47,843 megawatts -- was about 4 percent lower than forecast. "Californians responded to our call to conserve," said Stephanie McCorkle of the Cal ISO, which manages transmission lines owned by the state's three large investor-owned utilities: Pacific Gas and Electric Co., Southern California Edison, and San Diego Gas and Electric Co. The heat wave will not break until next Tuesday, the first work day after the holiday. For instance, Fresno in the Central Valley of California will have a high of 108 degrees Fahrenheit (42.2 Celsius) on Friday, 106 F on Saturday and Sunday and 104 F on Monday but by Tuesday will be a less-scorching 94 F (34.4 C), forecaster AccuWeather said. Friday's demand was expected to top 48,000 megawatts, which would normally be enough to serve 34 million homes. Such high demand would have crippled the power grid in 2000-2001 when rolling blackouts struck California. No catastrophic outages took place this week in large part because California has access to 16,000 more megawatts than were available during the energy crisis. The grid has been expanded to handle more power flow, McCorkle said. While the 2000-2001 energy crisis was also sparked by exploitation of the since-revamped power trading system by traders from companies like the disgraced Enron Corp., infrastructure improvements are the main reason current high demand has not created headlines of a California in crisis. In California, a megawatt can power about 650 to 700 average homes under normal conditions. That number drops during heat waves when people crank up air conditioning. While it has been hot this week, it was not quite as hot as the killing heat wave of July 2006, which caused more than 2 million homes and businesses to lose power, leading to the deaths of hundreds. A more influential difference, utility officials said, was last year's heat storm lasted two weeks while this spell is seen lasting six days. Record demand for Cal ISO is 50,270 megawatts 13 months ago.
