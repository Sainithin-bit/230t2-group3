 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The board of Harrah's Entertainment 
Inc. HET.N is considering two bids, each offering around $16 
billion for the casino company, according to a report on the 
Wall Street Journal's Web site on Friday. 

  Private equity firms Apollo Management and Texas Pacific 
Group TPG.UL have submitted an offer for $87 per share in 
cash for Harrah's, the newspaper reported.  The company has also received an offer of $87 per share -- 
with $71 in cash and $16 in stock -- from casino operator Penn 
National Gaming Inc. ( PENN.O ), the newspaper said, citing 
unnamed sources.  Las Vegas-based Harrah's, which operates casinos under such 
brands as Harrah's, Caesars and Horseshoe, had set a deadline 
of Tuesday on all bids, and its board met this week to consider 
the offers, sources told Reuters earlier.  The board could also consider a leveraged recapitalization 
as an alternative, a source has said. It was unclear when 
Harrah's would make a decision on the offers.  Harrah's has so far acknowledged only one offer. It said on 
October 2 that a committee of nonmanagement directors was 
reviewing an $81-per-share bid from Apollo Management and Texas 
Pacific Group.  Harrah's shares closed up 39 cents at $79.50 on Friday at 
the New York Stock Exchange, as investors anxiously waited for 
the outcome of the takeover saga, which has been dragging on 
for more than two months.
