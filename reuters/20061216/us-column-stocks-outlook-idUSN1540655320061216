 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - With Wall Street in the final stretch of the year and the Dow Jones industrial average in record territory, investors expect next week to bring in even more holiday cheer. 

 But before any wild celebrations can begin, investors will have to contend with speeches by two key Federal Reserve officials on the state of the U.S. economy and a slew of economic reports, including the November Producer Price Index. The final reading on third-quarter gross domestic product, November housing starts and the "core" personal consumption expenditures price index -- the Fed's preferred measure of inflation -- are also on tap. After the surprisingly mild data on consumer prices, investors will pay extra heed to the PPI report and the core PCE data. These numbers could help investors adjust their expectations of when the Fed may start cutting interest rates. "PPI may play a role, but the big number next week is probably going to be the PCE number that's coming out on Friday," said Joe Liro, economist and market strategist at Stone & McCarthy Research Associates in Princeton, New Jersey. "The PCE number," he added, "will give us an idea of just how strong the fourth quarter was in terms of real growth and" it will give "a good idea of what (the) inflation numbers are. There should be good news on both." VISIONS OF M&A SUGARPLUMS Moreover, if the week opens with yet another "Merger Monday," Santa could turn out to be even more generous to the stock market, analysts said. Gains generated in the market's penultimate week will put stocks firmly on track for their biggest finish in two years. At Friday's close, the Dow was up 1.1 percent for the week -- marking its second straight weekly gain -- while the S&P 500 finished the week up 1.2 percent and the Nasdaq gained 0.8 percent. With only two weeks left in the year, the Dow is up 16 percent for 2006 so far, while the S&P 500 is up 14 percent and the Nasdaq is up 11 percent. "I would guess we have some merger news on Monday as people try to get deals in before the end of the year," said Christopher Zook, chairman and chief investment officer at CAZ Investments in Houston, Texas. Wall Street's rush to do as many deals as possible could coincide with a last-minute push by some fund managers to snag the market's winning stocks for their portfolios before they pull the curtain on 2006, analysts added. This past week, forecast-beating earnings from a range of companies, including investment banks Goldman Sachs ( GS.N ), Bear Stearns Cos. Inc. BSC.N and Lehman Brothers Holdings LEH.N plus warehouse club retailer Costco Wholesale Corp. ( COST.O ), helped the Dow resume its record-setting streak after a month's hiatus. NOW FOR A WORD FROM THE FED Even so, next week's Fed speakers may give some hints about what's likely to guide the Fed's approach on future interest-rate policy. On Tuesday, the Federal Open Market Committee left the benchmark fed funds rate target unchanged at 5.25 percent for the fourth straight time. In August, the FOMC paused after raising rates for 17 times stretching back to June 2004. Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas President Richard Fisher is scheduled on Tuesday to give a speech entitled "A Year-End Wrapup of the Economy" in Longview, Texas. On Thursday, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond President Jeffrey Lacker will speak on the economic outlook before the Charlotte Chamber of Commerce in North Carolina. "The market continues to believe that the Fed has engineered this soft landing they were hoping to get," said Ernie Ankrim, chief investment strategist for Russell Investment Group in Tacoma, Washington. "There's a recognition that the Fed is done increasing rates," he added. A SLEIGH FULL OF NUMBERS Next week's economic calendar has at least one set of numbers worth noting on every single day. On Monday, the National Association of Home Builders will release its December index and third-quarter U.S. current account deficit figures also are due. Tuesday's agenda calls for November PPI and housing starts. Economists polled by Reuters expect the core Producer Price Index, excluding volatile food and energy prices, to have grown 0.2 percent in November, after falling 0.9 percent in October. Headline PPI is seen up 0.5 percent in November following a 1.6 percent drop in October. November housing starts are forecast to have risen to an annualized rate of 1.530 million units from October's 1.486 million units, the Reuters poll showed. On Wednesday, weekly mortgage and refinancing numbers will come out. Thursday is GDP day. Economists polled by Reuters believe that third-quarter gross domestic product grew at an annual rate of 2.2 percent, matching the previously reported figure. On Friday, investors will get a glimpse into how consumers feel about their economic situation in the face of the housing slowdown. The University of Michigan's December consumer sentiment index, due on Friday, is pegged at a final reading of 90.2, down from November's 92.1. The "core" personal consumption expenditures index, also known as the core PCE index, is set for a Friday release. It is expected to rise 0.2 percent in November, matching its October gain. And last but not least will be November's U.S. durable goods orders, also scheduled to come out on Friday. Orders for durable goods, which are big-ticket items like cars and computers that are meant to last three years or more, are believed to have gone up 1.5 percent in November, after dropping 8.2 percent in October. RALLY SOME MORE - OR REST? But even if the data were to drive stocks higher, some analysts cautioned that the year's final two weeks could still surprise the market with turbulence. Investors might opt to sell some shares and take profits before closing the books on 2006. "We need a rest. We started the year-end rally early and the market's had a very dramatic run," said Al Goldman, chief market strategist at A.G. Edwards in St. Louis. "There's a correction out there someplace, but momentum says that's not going to happen over the very near term, so I think you have to respect that and say we're probably going to go higher." Besides the focus on economic data, next week also will shine the spotlight on notable S&P 500 components posting quarterly results. Among big-name earnings on the calendar are the No. 2 U.S. electronics chain Circuit City Stores Inc. CC.N; the world's biggest package delivery company FedEx Corp. ( FDX.N ); business software maker Oracle Corp. ORCL.O and pharmacy chain Walgreen Co. ( WAG.N ) (Wall St Week Ahead runs weekly.
