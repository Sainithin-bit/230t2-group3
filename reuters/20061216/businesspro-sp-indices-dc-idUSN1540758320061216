 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Standard & Poor's said on Friday that 
heavy equipment manufacturer Terex Corp. ( TEX.N ) will replace 
Navistar International Corp. ( NAV.N ) in the S&P 500 index after 
the close of trading on Tuesday, December 19. 

  Shares of Terex rose about 4 percent in trading after the 
market closed on the news, rising to $60.48 from their $58.13 
New York Stock Exchange close.  Truck and engine maker Navistar warned earlier on Friday it 
will miss its own deadline for filing delayed financial 
reports, prompting the New York Stock Exchange to say it will 
begin procedures to delist the stock.  Standard & Poor's also said that nutritional supplement 
maker Mannatech Inc. ( MTEX.O ) will replace American Italian 
Pasta Co. PLB.N in the S&P SmallCap 600 index after the close 
of trading on December 19.  American Italian Pasta said earlier the New York Stock 
Exchange plans to delist the company's stock because it will 
not meet an extended deadline for filing its 2005 annual 
report.  American Italian shares fell about 10 percent to $10.10.
