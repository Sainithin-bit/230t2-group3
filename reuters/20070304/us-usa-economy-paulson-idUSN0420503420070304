 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson on Sunday said he feels good about the U.S. economy and does not see the country slipping into recession. 


 In an interview with ABC's "This Week," Paulson offered some soothing words for financial markets after a week of volatility following some remarks by former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan that a recession was possible this year. Paulson acknowledged that an economic slowdown is possible, but said he saw a rosier outlook. "Clearly, no one's got a crystal ball. So there's always a possibility that there will be a downturn, always a possibility," Paulson said. "But I don't see it. I think we have a healthy economy in the U.S." He listed the positives for the U.S. economy, saying U.S. exports and consumer spending were strong, and some 7.4 million jobs have been created in the last few years. Real income is up and inflation is contained, he said. "So I'm feeling good about the U.S. economy," Paulson said. Last week Wall Street suffered its worst weekly decline in stock prices since January 2003, in a volatile week that rattled investors and raised questions about the U.S. economy and government borrowing from countries like China. Paulson, who headed the investment banking firm Goldman Sachs before joining President George W. Bush's administration, said debt to other countries should not be viewed as a sign of weakness but as a sign of strength. "As I look at the demand for ... U.S. treasuries, I'm very pleased to see demand from all around the world -- from governments, from individuals -- it's a positive, that foreign investors want to own our treasuries," Paulson said. "Interest rates are lower, it's helping our economic growth in this country." Huge U.S. trade deficits and mounting debt held by foreigners have come under fire from Democrats who control Congress. Paulson heads to Asia this week to talk about trade. He plans to meet with Japanese officials on Monday and also visit South Korea and China. Paulson said the U.S. relationship with China is important and has many dimensions. "I don't believe we need to make China an enemy," Paulson said.
