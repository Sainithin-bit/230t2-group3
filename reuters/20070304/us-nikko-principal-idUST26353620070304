 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Citigroup ( C.N ) is considering selling Nikko Cordial Corp's 8603.T principal finance arm if it acquires the scandal-hit Japanese brokerage group, the Nikkei business daily said on Sunday. 


 Citigroup is in talks to increase its stake in Nikko Cordial, which faces a de-listing from the Tokyo Stock Exchange due to an accounting scandal involving Nikko Principal Investments, the broker's principal investment unit. The U.S. bank believes it best to sell Nikko Principal because it would be difficult for the unit to generate stable earnings due to its damaged credibility, the Nikkei newspaper said. Selling Nikko Principal would also allow Citigroup to focus on bolstering Nikko's core corporate business, the paper said. No one at Nikko or Citigroup's Japan office could be reached for comment. Sources told Reuters last week that Citigroup was in talks to increase its stake in Nikko Cordial to at least 33.3 percent in a deal that would mark its resurgence in Japan after years of retrenchment. The U.S. bank has declined to comment, but it is widely expected to seek an even larger stake if Nikko is de-listed, possibly launching a bid for the whole firm, which has a current market value of about $10 billion. Buyout funds are thought to be interested in Nikko Principal's assets, which totaled 457.8 billion yen as of the end of 2006, the Nikkei said. Nikko Principal announced on Friday that it had sold British motorway services group RoadChef to an Israeli property company for 375 million pounds including debt.  Nikko has admitted falsifying documents and booking almost $300 million in excess profit over two years related to investments at Nikko Principal. The Nikkei reported last week that that Tokyo Stock Exchange is making final preparations to de-list Nikko after judging that its accounting manipulation was "systemic" and "malicious". The TSE has said it would make a decision in mid-March. Citigroup plans to put together a restructuring plan for Nikko Cordial before the TSE announces its decision, the Nikkei said.
