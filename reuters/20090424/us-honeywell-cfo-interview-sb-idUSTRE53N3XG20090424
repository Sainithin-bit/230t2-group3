 BOSTON  (Reuters) - Honeywell International Inc expects its aerospace and transportation businesses to stabilize by the end of the year, with its construction-related operations remaining weak longer, a top executive said. 

 The aerospace unit was hit hard by a sharp falloff in demand for corporate jets, while the transportation arm, which makes automotive turbochargers, has suffered from a shift in its key European markets toward smaller, non-diesel-powered vehicles, Chief Financial Officer Dave Anderson said on Friday. "The aerospace aftermarket globally and the transportation systems will see some stabilization in the second half of this year," Anderson said in a phone interview. "More than likely, improvement will begin in 2010, but from very reduced levels. The shape of that improvement we would anticipate right now to be relatively modest." Honeywell, the world's largest maker of cockpit electronics, was one of several U.S. industrial companies to report lower earnings and cut its 2009 profit forecast on Friday. Demand for Honeywell's thermostats and other automation systems used in large buildings has not fallen off as quickly, but the company expects that segment to take longer to hit bottom, Anderson said. "We're more than likely going to see some continued pressures on the long-cycle businesses through 2010," Anderson said. One factor that could help stabilize that market is demand related to U.S. President Barack Obama's $787 billion stimulus plan. "We certainly anticipate that in the second half we'll see order activity associated with the president's stimulus program, particularly as regards energy efficiency," Anderson said.
