 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Another lender to bankrupt U.S. cable TV operator Charter Communications has objected to the company's reorganization plan, saying Charter's attempt to reinstate $11.8 billion of debt may not be feasible. 

 In court documents filed on Wednesday, Wells Fargo, objected to Charter's pre-packaged bankruptcy reorganization plan, saying that it was too risky and could potentially fall apart. Charter, which is controlled by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, filed for bankruptcy protection last month, buckling under the weight $21.7 billion in debt. But when it filed for bankruptcy, the company had obtained pre-approval from many of its key stakeholders to pursue a reorganization plan that "reinstates" the company's senior bank debt at pre-bankruptcy interest rates, after the company exits from court protection. If the company is unable to reinstate its debt, Wells Fargo said Charter's interest payments will increase by more than $500 million annually, as it will have to reprice its debt at significantly higher interest rates. Almost immediately after filing for bankruptcy, Charter was sued by lender JPMorgan on behalf of itself and other holders of $8.5 billion in the company's senior debt. JPMorgan said Charter has violated its loan agreements and that the debt cannot be reinstated. Charter's official committee of unsecured creditors filed a motion to intervene in the dispute with JPMorgan on Thursday, saying JPMorgan had started the litigation "in an apparent effort to create a roadblock to reinstatement of the outstanding debt." Charter has also filed a motion to dismiss JPMorgan's complaint. The committee said it believes the interests of Charter's unsecured creditors will be "significantly impaired" if they are not able to reinstate the debt, or if the confirmation process for Charter's reorganization plan is delayed by the dispute. A hearing on Charter's motion to dismiss JPMorgan's complaint is set for May 5, according to court papers. The case is In re: Charter Communications, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York, No. 09-11435. (Editing by  Lincoln Feast )
