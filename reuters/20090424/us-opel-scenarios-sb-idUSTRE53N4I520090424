 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Dependent on a U.S. government lifeline, General Motors is looking to sell a controlling stake in its loss-making European operations centred on German unit Opel. 

 Here are some possible outcomes: BANKRUPTCY General Motors is facing a June 1 deadline to complete its restructuring with the aid of up to $5 billion in new government bailout funds, or face a likely Chapter 11 filing that many industry watchers believe would not be the surgical pre-packaged bankruptcy it's being touted as. Were GM to file for creditor protection, the European operations consisting of German carmaker Opel and its UK-based Vauxhall brand could ultimately face insolvency once their liquidity runs out. Should the 1.5 million vehicles manufactured each year by Opel/Vauxhall vanish entirely, this would remove a portion of the estimated 40 million units of global overcapacity. Rivals may look at acquiring specific parts of the business from an insolvency administrator, although GM Europe has said that it is not in danger of running out of cash soon thanks in part a sales boost from German government incentives to buy new cars. FIAT AS NEW PARTNER Some financial firms and rival auto companies have been mentioned as potential investors. But given the glut in capacity, finding a buyer will be challenging. Chinese manufacturers want to expand into western markets but repeated crash test failures in Europe have been disastrous for their image. A senior executive at one Chinese carmaker questioned their capability for taking over and turning around a global brand. Fiat, which believes it must raise volumes to around six million cars a year to survive in the long term, is looking to profit from the current crisis by tripling its size through the acquisition of loss-making Chrysler and Opel on the cheap. Chief Executive Sergio Marchionne, who pulled off a three-way merger in the past with Swiss group Alusuisse Lonza, France's Pechiney and Canada's Alcan, told Enzo Masini, an official with the FIOM-GGIL union, that Fiat "has the ability and capacity to handle two series of negotiations." Combining Opel and Fiat could create the second-largest auto maker in Europe behind Volkswagen as well as yielding "massive platform and engine synergies." It would also give Fiat much needed technology to allow it to stay competitive in Europe, Bernstein said in a recent analyst note. But serious questions surround Fiat's ability to fund such a deal or to pull off the integration. At the end of March, Fiat had 5.1 billion euros of industrial gross cash and 6.6 billion euros of net industrial debt. Options are limited due to Fiat's junk credit rating and 9.6 billion euros of debt refinancing due by the end of 2009, according to Bernstein Research. But Marchionne this week hinted there could be M&A activity involving the Iveco truck unit. Armin Schild, a German union leader and Opel supervisory board member, said he was worried Fiat would solve its own dramatic overcapacities by closing in particular German Opel plants using funds stumped up by German taxpayers. He favors an investment from Canada's Magna International, which has also emerged as a potential suitor and once bid for Chrysler. European Union Industry Commissioner Guenter Verheugen questioned how Fiat would finance deals for both Chrysler and Opel, drawing rebukes from Marchionne and Italy's foreign minister. STANDALONE GM has sought 3.3 billion euros in aid from European governments to help keep Opel and Vauxhall afloat. Sweden-based Saab, another GM unit, has already sought protection from creditors after Detroit essentially cut all financial ties. To make Opel viable as a standalone company, it needs to be sufficiently separated from parent GM to attract new investors. This could be a long-term financial investor like a sovereign wealth fund since GM as well as Opel dealers and workers may end up with competing equity stakes. U.S. investor Cerberus' disastrous investment in Chrysler and the lack of a clear path to profitability at Opel as well as political hurdles to plant closures and job cuts make an investment in Opel unattractive, several bankers told Reuters. Bankers and analysts say decoupling would likely be messy, requiring agreements between GM and its former European units to secure parts supplies and the rights to use technologies for which GM still holds the patents. The sale of any factories might be difficult given that the four German factories belong to Adam Opel GmbH, while others such as the Zaragoza plant in Spain or Poland's Gleiwitz belong to separate European GM units.
