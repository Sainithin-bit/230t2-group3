 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Both the Italian and Canadian governments are very interested in Fiat SpA and Chrysler LLC sealing a deal to form a partnership, Italy's economy minister said on Friday. 

 "It would be fantastic," Giulio Tremonti told Italian television after a meeting with his Canadian counterpart. "Canada has a great interest in it ... they view very well a deal with Fiat and so do we," he said. "An agreement would have a great positive effect," he added. Tremonti is taking part in G7 and G20 meetings. (Reporting by Francesca Landini; writing by  Gilles Castonguay )
