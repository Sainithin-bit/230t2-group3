 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - New U.S. orders for durable goods slipped 0.8 percent in March, far less than Wall Street expected, Commerce Department data showed on Friday. 

 KEY POINTS: * Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast orders for long-lasting manufactured goods to drop 1.5 percent. * Durable goods orders have now fallen for seven months out of the last eight, the Commerce Department said. * New orders excluding transportation slid 0.6 percent last month, compared to February when they rose 2.0 percent. * Orders excluding defense also fell 0.6 percent, after rising 0.2 percent in February. * Non-defense capital goods orders excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending, gained 1.5 percent in March after rising 4.3 percent in February. COMMENTS JACK BAUER, SENIOR ECONOMIST, MANNING & NAPIER, ROCHESTER, NEW YORK: "The durables report won't change our opinion all that much of what is going on in the economy. There were revisions to the prior month. "You want to see the financial sector stabilize. That is the first thing you would need to see the economy improve." DAN GREENHAUS, ANALYST, MILLER TABAK & CO, NEW YORK: "We came in a little less than expected, which isn't entirely surprising. There was a increase in non-defense capital spending, excluding aircraft, and that's a proxy for business spending. "I don't think this will have an impact on the markets. At the end of the day, the earnings are dictating trading. While important in the larger scheme, durable goods will take a backseat to some of the earnings that have been coming out." MARKET REACTION: STOCKS: S&P 500 equity index futures pare gains after data. BONDS: U.S. Treasury debt prices little changed. DOLLAR: U.S. dollar remains lower versus euro, yen.
