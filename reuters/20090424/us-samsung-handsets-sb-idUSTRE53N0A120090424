 SEOUL  (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics, the world's second-biggest maker of mobile phones, said on Friday its parent-basis telecom division's operating profit margin leapt to 12 percent in the first quarter from 2 percent in the previous quarter. 

 The company said its average handset selling price rose 2 percent from the fourth quarter of 2008 on increased mid- and high-end product sales, although the total volume of sales remained flat compared with a year earlier. Samsung, which is also the world's No. 1 maker of liquid crystal display (LCD) screens, said its display division posted a 8 percent loss margin in the first quarter on a parent basis, unchanged from the fourth.
