 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury's efforts to stress-test banks and supply capital to those that need it could result in the government taking a "substantial" ownership stake in banks, an oversight panel led by the Treasury and Federal Reserve said on Friday. 

 But the quarterly report from the Financial Stability Oversight Board said the Treasury viewed such investments as "temporary" and would use "reasonable efforts" to sell at least 20 percent of any common equity it acquires through the Capital Assistance Program each year. "U.S. government ownership is not an objective of the CAP, although the government has the potential to acquire a substantial portion of the outstanding common shares of a participating institution," the report said. "To the extent that the U.S. government acquires any ownership stake in a participating institution, Treasury will maintain the goal of keeping the period of government ownership as temporary as possible and encourage the return of private capital to replace the government investment."
