 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The White House said on Friday it expected some major banks that have undergone stress tests to release their own results and that the Obama administration would disclose some data as well. 

 "Our strong inclination is to provide transparency," White House spokesman Robert Gibbs told reporters. "I think you'll see some banks release on their own some of the results and we'll release what we deem applicable."
