 MUMBAI  (Reuters) - U.S. insurer American International Group ( AIG.N ) is in talks with potential buyers to sell its mutual funds business in India for roughly $10 million, according to a report in the Mint newspaper citing three unnamed people familiar with the matter. 

 The newspaper said Bank of America Merrill Lynch ( BAC.N ) had been appointed to arrange a sale of AIG Global Investment Group Mutual Fund, which has about 10.2 billion rupees ($230 million) under management. A sale would value the unit at roughly 4-5 percent of its assets under management, according to the report. The report said both AIG and Bank of America Merrill Lynch declined to comment.
