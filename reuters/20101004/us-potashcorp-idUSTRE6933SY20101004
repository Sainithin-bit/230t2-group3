 TORONTO/WINNIPEG  (Reuters) - A takeover of Potash Corp ( POT.TO ) by BHP Billiton ( BHP.AX ) could cost Saskatchewan C$2 billion ($1.96 billion) over 10 years, a report says, but it warns the Canadian province against opposing the miner's bid for the world's largest fertilizer producer. 

 Potash Corp shares jumped about 2 percent in Toronto on Monday after the report was released, suggesting that investors see it as increasing the likelihood that BHP's $39 billion hostile takeover bid will succeed. Saskatchewan, the Canadian province where Potash Corp is based, commissioned the report from the Conference Board of Canada, a nonprofit research organization. The province will play a crucial advisory role in the ultimate decision by the federal government on whether to approve the BHP bid or any other that may emerge. China has encouraged its state-owned companies to explore the possibility of mounting a rival offer. "If (Saskatchewan) wanted to act tough with BHP, (the report) doesn't give much political cover," said David McGrane, a political studies professor at University of Saskatchewan. "It definitely weakens their ability to be strict with their conditions" on a takeover. Conversely, the report gives the Saskatchewan government ample ammunition to oppose a Chinese bid, he said. Potash Corp, who has rejected BHP's offer as too low, is the No. 1 supplier of potash. Demand for its namesake product is expected to surge in the coming years as China, India and other countries work to feed their growing population. The province is mostly concerned about a takeover's impact on its finances. BHP could cost Saskatchewan as much as C$5.7 billion if it wins Potash and maximizes production, while also developing its own potash project at Jansen, Saskatchewan, the report said. That said, the scenario under which production is maximized is more likely to occur Chinese than BHP ownership, the report said. BHP's interests are more closely aligned with Saskatchewan's than those of any Chinese-led group that might mount a rival bid. China, as one of the world's top consumers of the crop nutrient, would prefer to keep potash prices low. "A producer that is unhinged from market discipline could potentially wreak havoc on Saskatchewan's finances," the report said. Saskatchewan Energy Minister Bill Boyd said the risks the report highlighted cause him concern. The provincial government plans to talk with other industry players before making recommendations to Ottawa within the month, he said. After a formal review, the Canadian government could veto the proposed takeover if it feels the deal would not carry a net benefit to Canada. The report said Saskatchewan would lose revenue under the BHP scenario because royalties and tax revenues would likely decline. The province collects hundreds of millions of dollars annually in royalties from potash miners, and fears a takeover could lead to lower global prices and reduced revenues. On a conference call, a member of the Conference Board said the report excludes the potential negative impact that a takeover could have on corporate income tax revenue for the provincial and federal governments. CAUTIONED AGAINST OPPOSING BHP BID Saskatchewan's main concern about BHP is that it prefers to market its commodities independently and would likely skirt Canpotex, the Canadian off-shore marketing consortium. Even so, the view that Canpotex manages supply-side risk "overstates the importance of its role," the Conference Board wrote. As Canpotex is a privately held company owned by Potash, Mosaic Co ( MOS.N ) and Agrium Inc ( AGU.TO ), it may not be wise for the province to pass laws to ensure its survival, the report said. While a BHP takeover of Potash could prove costly, changes to the province's royalty structure could mitigate the risks, according to the report. Despite the red flags, the board cautioned against Saskatchewan formally opposing the takeover bid. It said opposition would depress Potash Corp's share price and possibly hurt junior potash exploration companies. Indeed, the report said a rival bid involving China's Sinochem ( 600500.SS ), a sprawling, state-owned chemicals group. would present "a riskier scenario for the province." Without the commercial constraints that BHP has, Sinochem has a strong incentive to boost price competition, which would hurt all global potash producers, the report said. Before allowing such a deal, Canada would have to force the state-owned enterprise to refrain from influencing the market negatively, said one Canadian analyst covering the potash sector. "I don't see how that's possible considering all the complexities involved," said the analyst, who asked not to be named. A BHP spokesperson said it welcomes the report and believes its offer will bring significant net benefits to the province and Canada. A spokesperson for Potash Corp noted that BHP's takeover could reduce provincial revenue and said its board continues to recommend that its shareholders reject the bid.
