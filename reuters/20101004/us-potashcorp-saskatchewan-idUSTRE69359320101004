 WINNIPEG, Manitoba  (Reuters) - Saskatchewan will consider all options as it makes its pivotal recommendation on BHP Billiton's ( BHP.AX ) hostile takeover bid for Potash Corp ( POT.TO ), the Canadian province's energy minister said on Monday. 

 Saskatchewan released on Monday an independent report on the pros and cons of a takeover of Potash Corp. The report said a potential Chinese bid for Potash would be more risky than an acquisition by BHP. But provincial Energy Minister Bill Boyd said Saskatchewan has not ruled anything out. Boyd said he did not want to rank the risks involved with the BHP bid versus a possible offer from China. Saskatchewan, where Potash Corp is based and which depends on potash royalties, commissioned the report from the Conference Board of Canada, a nonprofit research organization. Ottawa can veto the takeover deal and has said it will listen to Saskatchewan's views. (Reporting by Rod Nickel; editing by Peter Galloway)
