 ZURICH  (Reuters) - Switzerland's global banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, must hold capital well in excess of new international standards, a government commission said, to limit the risk that a bank failure could drag down the whole economy. 

 The commission of top regulators, bank executives and other industry representatives said in a report on Monday that a mixture of measures was needed to reduce the risk of having banks with a "too big to fail" problem. Following are key points from the commission's final report: CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS * UBS and Credit Suisse should hold a total of 19 percent of risk-weighted assets according to new global standards (Basel III) based on the size of their balance sheets and their domestic market share. * At least 10 percent of this should be common equity, 9 percent can be in form of contingent convertible (CoCo) bonds. * The capital requirements are divided in three parts: -- The absolute minimum is 4.5 percent in common equity; -- A buffer of 8.5 percent in total of which 5.5 percent must be common equity and 3 percent can be CoCo bonds; -- A progressive component, depending on size, which currently amounts to 6 percent and can be CoCo bonds. * The so called CoCo bonds would be turned into equity if the common equity ratios fell below pre-defined levels. * The 3 percent in CoCo bonds of the buffer would be triggered if common equity falls below 7 percent. * The other 6 percent of capital in the form of CoCo bonds of the progressive component and are triggered if common equity falls below 5 percent. * The banks' leverage ratio should be at least 5 percent, in line with what regulators have defined as a level for "normal times." * Banks will be given until the end of 2018 to meet the new requirements, which is inline with the timeframe for the new global rules. BANKS' STRUCTURE * Both banks should be organized in a way that would allow for a break out of parts that are relevant for the functioning of the economy in case of a failure, in particular payment transactions, the deposit business and the lending business. * It should be up to banks to find the right structure and regulators would only order changes if the banks failed to come up with a convincing structure themselves. LIQUIDITY * The liquidity rules announced this summer will remain in place and should be given legal form. The core element of these rules is the "tough stress scenario," which combines a widespread financial markets crisis with creditors losing trust in a bank. The banks must hold an adequate reserve of first-class liquid assets to cover the outflows estimated in such a scenario over a period of at least 30 days. FURTHER MEASURES * The ongoing revision of the Banking Act should further improve bank insolvency law in Switzerland. The key aims of this revision are to make the insolvency procedure more flexible, maintain individual bank services through the transfer of important functions to a "bridge bank" and ensure simplified recognition of foreign bankruptcy orders and other restructuring acts of foreign authorities. * In the area of market infrastructure, improvements should be made by introducing central counterparties in the market for over-the-counter derivatives (derivatives traded outside exchanges between two market participants).
