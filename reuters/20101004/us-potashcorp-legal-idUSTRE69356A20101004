 TORONTO  (Reuters) - Potash Corp ( POT.TO ) has asked a court to deny BHP Billiton's ( BHP.AX ) request for documents as part of the discovery process in a legal battle over BHP's $39 billion hostile bid for the world's largest fertilizer company. 

 BHP has asked Potash Corp to produce documents relating to potential alternative bidders. It has also asked the Canadian company for information on its internal evaluation of what its stock is worth. Last month, Potash Corp, the world's No.1 fertilizer supplier, filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Chicago seeking a preliminary injunction to block BHP's offer. BHP has filed a motion asking the court to dismiss the suit. The two sides have submitted a list of documents that each says it needs to bolster their own arguments in the case. Potash Corp argues that its evaluation of the tender offer and its valuations and methodologies are irrelevant since BHP has asserted no claims against Potash Corp. "BHP seeks confidential strategic information that would give it a tremendous - and unfair - business advantage and severely disadvantage PCS and its shareholders," said Potash Corp in its motion for a protective order. As part of the discovery process, Potash Corp have asked that BHP produce a list of documents that include BHP's statements about investments in the potash industry and the minutes of BHP's board meetings that relate to the potash sector. BHP has also been asked to provide any documents on its plans to develop its Jansen potash project in Saskatchewan and for its top executives to present depositions in relation to the matter.
