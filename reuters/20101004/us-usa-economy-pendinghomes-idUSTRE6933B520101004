 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Pending sales of previously owned U.S. homes rose to a four-month high, indicating the housing market was regaining some stability after recent steep declines. 

 FACTORY ORDERS: KEY POINTS: * The National Association of Realtors said its Pending Home Sales Index, based on contracts signed in August, increased 4.3 percent to 82.3 from July. * It was the second straight month of gains in the index, which leads existing home sales by a month or two. July contracts were revised down to show a 4.5 percent increase instead of the previously reported 5.2 percent rise. * Total factory orders fell to a seasonally adjusted $408.9 billion after an upwardly revised 0.5 percent increase in July and a 0.6 percent fall in June. Economists surveyed by Reuters had forecast a decline of 0.4 percent in August. COMMENTS: STEPHEN MASSOCCA, MANAGING DIRECTOR, WEDBUSH MORGAN, SAN FRANCISCO: "It was pretty much as expected. Factory orders were a little worse, so I don't think there were any surprises there. People are more focused on currencies today and the relationship between the dollar trade and stocks." PETER JANKOVSKIS, CO-CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, OAKBROOK INVESTMENTS LLC, LISLE, ILLINOIS: "With the revisions to the prior month's data I would say they were pretty much in line with expectations that's why you are not seeing much of a move. "People are waiting to see as we look at additional numbers, like employment coming out at the end of this week to see where those numbers take us. It was a pretty breathtaking rally when you look at it, in particular coming so rapidly after the downdraft in August. So people are likely sitting that out and of course as we get closer and closer to November elections that is going to play a role as well." STEVE GOLDMAN, MARKET STRATEGIST, WEEDEN & CO, BASED IN GREENWICH, CONNECTICUT: "Data on the pending (home sales) was a bit better, and factory orders a bit weaker, but the month before was revised so an improvement there. For the markets it's really not a moving item here; the market's in this consolidation mode after being up as much as we've been for the past month or so but still looking to be supported after modest pullbacks." MICHAEL MORAN, CHIEF ECONOMIST, DAIWA SECURITIES AMERICA, NEW YORK: "The factory orders report is consistent with moderate growth in the manufacturing sector. It was down, but mostly due to commercial aircraft. Outside of transportation you had reasonably good results, up 0.9 percent. In non-durables you are up 0.3 percent which is not vigorous growth but it is an expansion and suggests activity is moving ahead to a degree. "Pending home sales had a second consecutive monthly increase, but what you gained in those two months is just a small share of the retreat in this index after the expiration of the tax credit. We're still at a low level of activity for sales of existing homes. Pending home sales relate to that." TOM PORCELLI, HEAD OF U.S. MARKET ECONOMICS, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS, NEW YORK, NEW YORK: "The pending home sales data does not change the backdrop onebit for the housing market and I still expect it to muddle along the bottom. The real issue is the supply and demand imbalance. We are still dealing with a supply issue that is a bit on the scary side. Home prices could easily fall another 15 percent due to this imbalance. This does not change the story for housing and was close enough to expectations that will likely not cause any movements in the markets. At best, pending home sales is a secondary indicator and we would need a number well outside of consensus to capture the market's reaction." MICHAEL WOOLFOLK, SENIOR CURRENCY STRATEGIST, BNY MELLON, NEW YORK: "We're seeing a very modest dollar bid, with the euro/dollar back below 1.37. Pending home sales were modestly better than expected. The upward surprise outweighs the modest downward revision to the prior month. Factory orders were basically in line with expectations. Net-net, not out of the ballpark good, but decent, though these really are secondary numbers. People have been shorting the dollar at any opportunity, and the trend of the dollar weakening on strong U.S. data has broken down. The only thing that seems to provide some respite, interestingly enough, has been positive U.S. economic data. It's fair to say the market is mainly trading on expectations of what the Fed will do regarding easing." RYAN WANG, U.S. ECONOMIST, HSBC SECURITIES USA, NEW YORK "The pending home sales data show that sales have stabilized at very, very low levels after the expiration of the federal tax credits. At these low levels, you could see some good percentage increases in sales, but it doesn't show any sustainable uptrend in housing conditions." MARKET REACTION: STOCKS: U.S. stock indexes were mildly lower. BONDS: U.S. Treasury debt prices were little changed. DOLLAR: U.S. dollar slipped slightly against the euro.
