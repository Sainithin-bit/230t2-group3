 (Reuters) - Following are some facts and figures on private equity in Germany: 

 - Some 6,000 German firms with around 1 million workers are currently financed by private equity. - Most of the cash flowing to German private equity funds comes from institutional investors, banks, insurance companies and pension funds. - In the second quarter of this year, private equity firms active in Germany drew in 1.382 billion euros ($1.9 billion) in new funds and investment totaled 528 million euros, down from 1.316 billion in the first quarter. - New funds were invested in 331 companies in the April-June period, up from 302 in the first three months of the year. - Private equity has had a relatively short history in Germany and public perception has been colored by some negative experiences linked to the bursting of the tech bubble in 2000. - Many entrepreneurs at small and mid-sized companies are suspicious of private equity firms as they fear losing control over their own firms. - Social Democrat (SPD) Vice Chancellor Franz Muentefering likened investors such as private equity firms to locusts (Heuschrecken) in a speech in late 2004, a term which is still regularly used. - Germany lags well behind countries such as the United States, Britain, Sweden and the Netherlands in terms of private equity investment. - Germany does not have a law that specifically regulates private equity investments, something industry groups complain about. There is no specific authority that oversees private equity activities. - Taxation of the funds, while complex, is seen as relatively favorable compared to other countries. - The number of German firms financed by private equity in the first six months of 2007 rose to 556 compared with 473 in the same period a year earlier. - The volume of investment almost doubled in the first half of this year, to 1.845 billion euros from 939 million in the year-earlier period.
