 NORDHAUSEN, Germany  (Reuters) - Workers at the Bike Systems GmbH bicycle factory in the eastern German town of Nordhausen feel betrayed by their U.S.-based private equity employer and have occupied the building since July 5 in protest. 

 Banners outside the plant read: "We are fighting for Bike Systems!", "Germany wake up! How many more firms are going to be run into the ground?", and "Lone Star wants to palm us off!" An effigy of a locust the size of a small dog is crucified on a black cross above the gate to the factory, which is owned by Dallas, Texas-based Lone Star. This is the latest skirmish in a battle pitting German workers against private equity firms that has raged since Franz Muentefering, then chairman of the Social Democrats (SPD) and now vice chancellor, railed in 2005 against capitalist "locusts" who chewed up companies and destroyed jobs. The clash in Nordhausen, once the site of a Nazi rocket factory, feeds into a wider debate about how much scope foreign investors should be allowed to buy into German firms. The debate is linked to a German drive to make hedge funds reveal more about their activities so regulators can identify and tackle potential risks to the global financial system. Last week, Chancellor Angela Merkel's ruling coalition of conservatives and the SPD agreed to examine ways to protect companies from foreign takeover, fuelling fears among investors of a more protectionist approach in Europe's biggest economy. Merkel said the recent turmoil on financial markets showed her government was right to insist on boosting transparency for hedge funds and pressed for fresh progress to be made. MIDDLE GROUND Just how much more open Merkel's administration decides it wants foreign investment firms to be about their operations will be crucial to determining the business environment in Germany. Governments need to be careful if they want investors to be more open about their activities, said Tereza Tykvova at the Centre for European Economic Research (ZEW) in Mannheim. "A bit more transparency than we currently have would certainly be welcome," Tykvova said. "But the question is how far you go because if you reveal too much then that can be harmful to competition. You have to find the middle ground." Elements of the SPD are deeply suspicious of private equity and hedge funds. The party even drew up a "black list" in April 2005 that included high-profile investment firms like Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co (KKR), Blackstone and Permira. Despite this backdrop, plenty of private equity firms are doing business in Germany, where the economy grew at its fastest pace in six years last year. The volume of investment by private equity firms almost doubled in the first half of this year to 1.845 billion euros ($2.52 billion) from 939 million in the year-earlier period. Although Germany lags well behind countries such as the United States and Britain in terms of private equity investment, the sector is growing. New funds were invested in 331 firms in the April-June period, up from 302 in the first quarter. "SOLD OUT" For the 150 workers at Bike Systems, the private equity experience has proven brutal. Lone Star bought the struggling firm in late 2005 but halted production at the end of June and moved to close down the plant. The workers have occupied the factory for over seven weeks. "We have been sold out and betrayed -- it's as simple as that," said Adolf Geha, 55, who has worked at the firm for more than 20 years. "It's just as Mr Muentefering said -- they are locusts. They feed and fly on to the next victim." Worker representatives accuse Lone Star of stripping the company of its orders and material and transferring them to Mitteldeutsche Fahrradwerke AG (Mifa), another bicycle plant in which it owns a stake in nearby Sangerhausen. In a written statement, Lone Star said it had tried to make the firm competitive again and secure its long-term future. "Lone Star invested a considerable amount in restructuring measures but in June 2007 did not consider itself able to continue running the business due to accumulated losses." Because workers at Bike Systems had rejected both a severance package and an offer of work at Mifa, Lone Star had no option other than to institute insolvency proceedings, it added. Tykvova at the ZEW said that, in general, it was good for the economy if private equity firms turned inefficient firms around and there were many studies that showed private equity investments typically created jobs and made companies fitter. ** For a factbox on private equity firms in Germany, double click on
