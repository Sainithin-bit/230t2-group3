 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - SAP AG called for a quick resolution of a U.S. lawsuit in which rival Oracle Corp is suing it for "corporate theft on a grand scale" and asked for mediation to start in coming months. 

 Oracle said the scope of the case, which concerns disputed downloads of Oracle software at an SAP U.S. subsidiary, meant the process of discovery of documents and facts would take at least 18 months. It proposed a trial date of September 25, 2009. The two companies, bitter rivals in the global market for business software, submitted their positions in a Tuesday night filing to the U.S. District Court in San Francisco, which will hold a case conference to determine next steps on September 4. SAP called for the appointment of a mediator, saying this could lead to a settlement or at least help the parties agree on the size of Oracle's damages claim or the scope or timing of the discovery process. "Prompt resolution of this case is in the best interests of all concerned," it said. Oracle dismissed SAP's proposal as an attempt to limit its investigation into how far admitted wrongdoing at SAP subsidiary TomorrowNow extended into SAP itself. "The evidence of unauthorized downloading ... is likely only the tip of the iceberg," it said. "Oracle is entitled to know what happened, what SAP knew, when SAP knew it and how much SAP has benefited from its scheme." Germany-based SAP, the world's biggest maker of business software, has admitted TomorrowNow carried out downloads of Oracle customer-support software that were "inappropriate". But it denies claims by Oracle, a database specialist which is closing the gap on SAP through an aggressive acquisitions strategy, that SAP itself amassed this downloaded material into an illegal library of Oracle software. TomorrowNow specializes in support for legacy PeopleSoft and JD Edwards software. SAP bought the company in 2005 to help it win over Oracle customers after PeopleSoft and JD Edwards were acquired by Oracle.
