 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Regulators need not lift investment caps on Fannie Mae FNM.N and Freddie Mac FRE.N in order to rescue troubled subprime borrowers, but new loan products could help some avoid foreclosure, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said in a letter released on Wednesday. 

 "The current caps on GSE portfolios, which were imposed for safety and soundness reasons, need not be lifted to allow them to accommodate new borrowers," Bernanke said in a letter dated August 27 that was released by Democratic Sen. Charles Schumer of New York. Fannie and Freddie, publicly-traded companies that hold federal charters to nurture the housing finance system, are known as government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs). The companies bundle and sell home loans as securities but also earn money from holding mortgage investments. Critics of the companies say their combined $1.4 trillion mortgage investment portfolio is bloated and dangerously concentrated in the hands of the two firms. In his letter, Bernanke suggested that policymakers might "encourage the GSEs to increase their mortgage securitization efforts, which are not constrained" by a cap on investments. The Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, the companies' federal regulator, ordered Fannie and Freddie to freeze their mortgage holdings near their current level more than a year ago after accounting scandals shook both firms. Some lawmakers, including Schumer, say that easing the caps on the government-sponsored enterprises' investment holdings would help ease the turmoil in markets for subprime mortgages by allowing them to buy more loans. But Bernanke wrote that a more effective way to help subprime borrowers might be for the private and public sector to ease troubled borrowers into new, more flexible loans. Those new mortgages could include "variable maturities or shared-appreciation provisions for example," he wrote. LONGER MATURITIES Some mortgage experts have suggested that subprime borrowers could save their homes with mortgages that mature in 40 or even 50 years rather than the traditional 30-year mortgage. Under shared-appreciation provisions, mortgage lenders and borrowers both benefit from any increase in the value of a home. In a separate letter dated August 23, Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson told Schumer that his office was also helping the private and public sectors try and find ways to ease subprime borrowers out of burdensome loans. Bernanke said the Fed was closely monitoring conditions in financial markets and has taken steps to ensure that there is ample liquidity including by lowering its discount rate for loans to banks. "Also, the Federal Open Market Committee has stated that it is monitoring the situation and is prepared to act as needed to mitigate the adverse effects on the economy arising from the disruption in financial markets," Bernanke wrote. The FOMC is the U.S. central bank's policy-setting group. Bernanke said he shared Schumer's concern about the potential impact on borrowers of mortgage payment "resets" in coming months on adjustable-rate loans worth hundreds of millions of dollars. "Over the next several years, many such homeowners will face significantly higher monthly payments and, consequently, an increased risk of losing their homes to forced sales or foreclosures," the Fed chief acknowledged. Bernanke said it might be worth considering whether the private and public sectors could help ease the stress in subprime markets "by developing a broader range of mortgage products which are appropriate for low- and moderate-income borrowers, including those seeking to refinance." Such products might ease the risk of "payment shock" and should also offer a much clearer explanation of their terms, Bernanke said. One of the chief criticisms from lawmakers and others is that lenders were too ready to offer adjustable-rate mortgages to poorer consumers without explaining how much payments might jump as the rates reset and without making adequate checks to ensure that borrowers would be able to keep the payments up.
