 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Altria Group Inc ( MO.N ) and Philip Morris International could each have their own share repurchase programs following the planned spinoff of the international tobacco company, Altria Chairman and Chief Executive Louis Camilleri said on Wednesday. 

 During a conference call, Camilleri also said Altria would tender for $4 billion in Altria debt before the spinoff and refinance that debt. Camilleri said the timing and magnitude of the repurchase programs would be announced at an "appropriate time." He said he sees the new Altria having a net earnings payout ratio target of 75 percent and Philip Morris International having a target of 65 percent. Combined, the companies' quarterly dividends would be at least equal to 75 cents per share, Camilleri said. Earlier on Wednesday, Altria said it plans to spin off the Philip Morris International tobacco unit but will not give details on the timing of the much anticipated move until January. Altria also raised its quarterly dividend by 8.7 percent to 75 cents per share.
