 LONDON  (Reuters) - Katanga Mining Ltd ( KAT.TO ) Chief Executive Arthur Ditto said on Wednesday he was not interested in the $1.44 billion approach from London-listed CAMEC CFM.L, and that other parties were interested in the company. 

 "It's certainly not interesting to me, and it is hard to perceive it as being of much interest to Katanga shareholders who aren't somehow tied to CAMEC," he told Reuters in a telephone interview. "There is the prospect of an alternative to this -- much more attractive and sensible to Katanga shareholders. There are other parties interested in the situation who are examining information," he added. Central African Mining & Exploration (CAMEC) said earlier on Wednesday it would offer 17 of its shares for each Katanga share, valuing the Canadian company at C$1.52 billion (US$1.44 billion). Both companies are focused on the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
