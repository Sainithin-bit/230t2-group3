 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - The U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New York on Wednesday approved a Delphi Corp DPHIQ.PK contract with the United Steelworkers union, wrapping up the labor deals the car parts maker needs for its reorganization. 

 Judge Robert Drain approved the agreement that Delphi and the steelworkers union had reached earlier in August. The deal covers about 900 workers at two Ohio plants, one of which Delphi plans to close or sell. Delphi, which filed for bankruptcy in October 2005, has said it expects to file a plan of reorganization by the end of September and exit bankruptcy protection by the end of 2007. Delphi plans to retain only eight of 29 U.S. union plants after the restructuring, including one in Vandalia, Ohio, that has steelworkers union members. It plans to close or sell a steelworker-represented plant in Dayton, Ohio. All the contracts reached between Delphi and its unions have been negotiated with former Delphi parent General Motors Corp ( GM.N ) as well. Deals were reached previously with the United Auto Workers, the International Union of Electrical Workers - Communications Workers of America and other unions.
