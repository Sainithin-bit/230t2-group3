 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Private equity firms Madrone Capital Partners and Goldman Sachs Capital Partners agreed to invest $1 billion in closely-held Global Hyatt Corp, the hotel company's Chairman, Tom Pritzker, said on Wednesday. 

 Madrone Capital Partners, a private investment firm affiliated with Rob Walton, Chairman of Wal-Mart Stores Inc ( WMT.N ) and his family, along with Goldman Sachs Group Inc ( GS.N ) will each receive a board seat. Pritzker said the equity investment will be used primarily to provide liquidity to the Pritzker family interest that currently own Global Hyatt. The extended family is in the process of restructuring the family's holdings. Hyatt is a medium-sized U.S.-based hotel company with more than 735 hotels and resorts in 44 countries, under brands such as Grand Hyatt, Hyatt Resorts and Andaz. "The addition of these sophisticated investors with long- term horizons will allow us to further our restructuring efforts without affecting Global Hyatt's financial capacity to grow and execute on our business plan," Pritzker said in a statement. Pritzker did not disclose details about the structure of the deal. (Reporting by  Lisa Lee )
