 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Chrysler LLC has proposed shedding non-core assets in contract talks with the United Auto Workers, the Wall Street Journal reported in its online edition. 

 The car maker has proposed shutting down or selling its Mopar unit, a maker of high-performance and specialty auto parts, and Chrysler Transport, which manages deliveries of supplies to Chrysler plants, the report said, citing people familiar with the matter. The UAW opposes the divestments, and together Mopar and Chrysler Transport employ almost 1,300 workers, the report said. The report said it was unclear whether the divestments would be part of the final agreement. A Chrysler spokesperson did not immediately return a call seeking comment.
