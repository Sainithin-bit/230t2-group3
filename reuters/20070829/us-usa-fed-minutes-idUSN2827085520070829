 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve realized at its last regular meeting that worsening financial market conditions might require a policy response but clung to its firm focus on inflationary risks, minutes of the August 7 meeting showed on Tuesday. 

 "Members expected a return to more normal market conditions, but recognized that the process likely would take some time, particularly in markets related to subprime mortgages," the central bank's policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee said. "However, a further deterioration in financial conditions could not be ruled out and, to the extent such a development could have an adverse effect on growth prospects, might require a policy response," the Fed said. "Policy makers would need to watch the situation carefully." The minutes show policy-makers agreeing that recent strains in financial markets posed additional risks to economic growth, but believing their forecast of moderate growth would be supported by job gains, rising incomes, and foreign demand for goods and services. The minutes dampened investor hopes for a near term cut in the benchmark federal funds rate to help ease tight credit conditions and financial market turmoil, causing stock indexes to extend their losses and Treasury debt prices to extend their gains. "They are separating the economy from the market and they have a two-track way of dealing with it," said Doug Roberts, founder and chief investment strategist at Channel Capital Research in Shrewsbury, New Jersey. "They'll use the fed funds rate for economic deterioration and the discount rate, capital infusion and discussions with other central banks to deal with the market situation," he said. "If the (economic) numbers hold up they will be inclined not to lower the fed funds rate." VIEW DETERIORATES IN 10 DAYS The Fed at its August 7 meeting left the federal funds rate target unchanged at 5.25 percent, saying the risk that inflation would fail to moderate was its predominant concern, although it noted that risks to growth had increased somewhat. However, the Fed acted unexpectedly on August 17, lowering the discount rate -- the rate it charges banks for direct loans -- to 5.75 percent, and acknowledging that risks to growth had increased "appreciably" as a result of financial market deterioration and tighter credit conditions. The minutes released on Tuesday did not include discussions connected to the Fed's August 17 actions, which occurred after a week of severe stock market falls following the August 7 meeting. Federal Open Market Committee members on August 7 acknowledged the recent strains in the financial markets posed additional downside risks to economic growth. But at the time, their expectation for the economy was for continued moderate growth, with upside risks to inflation as the most significant policy concern. "The expansion would be supported by solid job gains and rising real incomes that would bolster consumption and by increasing foreign demands for goods and services produced in the united States," the Fed said in the minutes. "The ongoing adjustment in housing markets likely would exert a restraining influence on overall growth for several more quarters and remained a key source of uncertainty about the outlook." The Fed also acknowledged on August 7 that markets for mortgage securities backed by subprime and non-traditional mortgages "had become illiquid" as investors grew uncertain about their cash flow. Despite those problems, the Fed expected those markets would recover, and noted that financing was readily available for most home buyers and rates had dropped in recent weeks for prime mortgages, lending some support to housing. However, on August 17 the Fed said financial market conditions had deteriorated and threatened to restrain economic growth. The FOMC said it was "prepared to act as needed to mitigate the adverse effects of the economy arising from the disruptions in financial markets."
