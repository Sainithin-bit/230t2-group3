 VERONA, Italy  (Reuters) - Italian banks should use profits to underpin capital bases and a turn to markets to boost capital seems inevitable, European Central Bank Governing Council member Mario Draghi said on Saturday. 

 Taking renewed aim at lenders' dividends, Draghi, who is also head of the Bank of Italy, said maintaining adequate reserves of liquidity was vital to safeguard stability and assure lending. "We expect that as in 2009 a large part of last year's profits will be allocated to increasing the banks' capital. Nevertheless, recourse to the capital market would also appear unavoidable as soon as conditions permit," he said in a speech at the AIAF-ASSIOM Forex conference. "Prudence should not be sacrificed to considerations of profit," said Draghi, who urged banks in March 2010 to strengthen capital rather than pay out dividends. Italian banks are at the low end among European lenders in terms of capital ratios. They face having to raise them to meet Basel III rules aimed at avoiding a repeat of the financial crisis. Draghi said the conservative policies of Italian banks had initially shielded them in the crisis. However, profits have since been squeezed and boosting capital was vital, especially with the upcoming launch of the Basel III rules. "For banks to be prepared when the new capital adequacy rules are fully phased in, capital strengthening must proceed, above all through retained earnings," he said. Federico Ghizzoni, the chief executive of UniCredit SpA, Italy's biggest bank by market value, said UniCredit had adequate capital and it was up to individual banks to decide if they needed an increase. "I agree with Draghi that the priority is the capital base. But as to the dividend, that is up to the shareholders," he told reporters after the address. Chairman Dieter Rampl also said UniCredit had no need for a capital increase. UniCredit carried out two capital increases during the financial crisis. Ghizzoni has said UniCredit aims to continue to pay a dividend on 2010 results. Among other lenders, Banco Popolare concluded a 2 billion euro capital increase this month.
