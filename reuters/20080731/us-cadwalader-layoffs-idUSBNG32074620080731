 (Reuters) - New York law firm Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft LLP is laying off 96 lawyers, most of whom worked in the real-estate finance and securitizations practices, the Wall Street Journal said on Thursday, citing a company official. 

 The affected lawyers are from the firm's offices in New York, Charlotte, North Carolina, Washington and London, the Journal said. By September, the firm will have 580 lawyers, the same number it had in January 2006, the newspaper said, citing the head of Cadwalader's litigation practice, Gregory Markel. Cadwalader currently has more than 600 attorneys, according to the firm's website. An email to a Cadwalader spokeswoman was not returned immediately.
