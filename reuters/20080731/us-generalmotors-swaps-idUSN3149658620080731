 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The cost to insure the debt of General Motors Corp ( GM.N ) hit record highs on Thursday after finance company GMAC LLC reported a $2.48 billion loss for the second quarter and one day before the automaker reports its second-quarter results. 

 GM's benchmark long bonds hit a record low below 50 cents on the dollar, pushing their yields past 17 percent. Five-year credit default swaps on GM's debt jumped to 41.5 percent of the sum insured, from 38.35 percent on Wednesday, plus annual premiums of 500 basis points, according to Markit Intraday. This means it would cost $4.15 million in a lump sum to insure $10 million in debt for five years, in addition to annual payments of $500,000. GM's 8.375 percent bonds due in 2033 traded as low as 49.5 cents on the dollar, a record low in the institutional market, before bouncing to 50.9 cents, according to MarketAxess. They had closed on Wednesday at 51.5 cents on the dollar. GMAC posted its fourth straight quarterly loss as rising gas prices forced it to write down leases on sport utility vehicles, while losses in its mortgage lending unit soared. The lender's results will hurt those of GM, which owns 49 percent of GMAC. GMAC also said GM will have to pay an estimated $1.5 billion to cover losses on vehicle leases due over the next several years.
