 LONDON  (Reuters) - Global stocks ticked higher on Thursday in the afterglow of a concerted central bank move to boost liquidity but a rebound in oil and disappointing results from some major companies capped gains. 

 Euro zone inflation jumped to a record high of 4.1 percent in July but failed to boost an already well-bid euro, leaving the focus on gross domestic product (GDP) data due from the United States at 8:30 a.m. EDT. MSCI's main world stock index gained 0.3 percent, rising for a third straight day but held in check by disappointing updates from drug maker Sanofi-Aventis ( SASY.PA ), telecommunications group BT ( BT.L ) and food giant Unilever ( ULVR.L ). Global equities gained on a move on Wednesday by U.S., European and Swiss central banks to extend emergency lending facilities for investment banks, but Wall Street futures pointed to falls of 0.1-0.2 percent on Thursday, suggesting a mini-rally was running out of puff. "People have been braced for mixed results and that's what we're getting. Costs are catching up and the consumer environment is weaker," said John Haynes, strategist at Rensburg Sheppard Investment Management. "The macroeconomists have much lower numbers for expected aggregate profitability than individual analysts, and I think this is going to be the first year where the strategists are more right than the underlying analysts," he said. On the positive side, Royal Dutch Shell ( RDSa.L ) posted strong results due to high oil prices and British bank HBOS HBOS.L jumped after analysts detected no nasty shocks in its results, helping European stocks recover from early losses. As the earnings season wears on, investors will train their sights on the European Central Bank. Analysts said that the inflation data suggested another increase was likely, but added that slowing growth would be a mitigating factor. "We still expect the ECB to hike in September as inflation is too high and that is their primary concern. But it's a close call as activity is very weak now," said Stephane Deo, an economist at UBS. Emerging market stocks rose 0.5 percent, and gold bounced off a five-week low as the dollar dipped against a basket of currencies. The U.S. advance second-quarter GDP data is expected to show growth of 2 percent, and is a key number as investors try to gauge the breadth of the impact of a credit crunch stemming from a collapse in risky mortgages. OIL JUMPS OVERNIGHT, TURKEY RALLIES Oil slipped 85 cents but had risen $4 a barrel overnight on an unexpected drop in U.S. gasoline stocks prompted by suppliers facing weak consumer demand cutting production and imports. Turkish markets surged as a court ruling against shutting the governing AK Party for anti-secular activities raised investors' hopes that greater political stability would boost the economy. Shares jumped 2.8 percent, the lira gained more than 2 percent and benchmark bond yields fell by a percentage point. U.S. treasuries were broadly steady in Europe ahead of the GDP data, while Euro zone government bonds reacted little to the inflation figures. And the LIBOR interbank cost of borrowing three-month dollar funds posted its biggest fall in a month in response to the central banks' liquidity measures. (Editing by David Christian-Edwards)
