 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The U.S. expansion accelerated modestly in the second quarter as government stimulus payments helped consumers add more buying punch to the economy, a Commerce Department report on Thursday showed. 

 The number of U.S. workers filing new claims for jobless benefits leapt 44,000 last week, government data on Thursday showed, but a Labor Department official said the increase was at least partly due to special factors.  KEY POINTS:  * Gross Domestic Product or GDP grew at a 1.9 percent annual rate, up from a revised 0.9 percent rate in the first quarter that previously was reported as 1 percent.  * Economists surveyed by Reuters had expected a 2.0 percent rise in GDP in the second quarter.  * That followed a 0.2 percent contraction in GDP during the final quarter of 2007 and avoided pushing the economy into back-to-back declines that would have met a popular definition of recession.  * Businesses reduced inventories at the sharpest rate since the end of 2001 in a sign they anticipate restrained growth ahead.  COMMENTS:  ROBERT MACINTOSH, CHIEF ECONOMIST, EATON VANCE MANAGEMENT, BOSTON: "We're in a recession. I don't know how they get the 1.9 in the second quarter. It's almost unconscionable that they go back seven months to take away eight-tenths of a percent, which makes it a negative quarter back in the fourth quarter. "They already had three shots at that number, why did it change so much? Now its actually negative, at least psychologically, that's a huge difference. "I think the most troubling thing out of all the numbers this morning is the claims number. If that doesn't convince people we're in a recession, then nothing will. "If the stock market feels like the Fed is not going to increase and in fact may actually cut rates, it's probably going to like that. Perverse as it may sound, equities may actually like what we found. "It probably hurts McCain a bit. The president gets blamed for these things, not Congress, rightly or wrongly, and I think it gives probably a boost to Obama. But I hope it makes him rethink all these tax increases he's talking about, because that will absolutely kill us."  DAVID RESLER, CHIEF ECONOMIST, NOMURA SECURITIES INTERNATIONAL, NEW YORK: GDP: "The headline numbers for the current quarter, which is calculating growth based on what we think we knew, is pretty close to what consensus estimates were. That is not very surprising. We thought there might be a chance for significant revisions to the past and the key note of those revisions was that the fourth quarter was revised to negative which revives the recession debate. The two previous quarters were both revised up a lot and the one before that revised down. It is a much more uneven pattern for GDP in the last year and a half or so as a result of these revision, although I don't think it changes the state of affairs as we are now." JOBLESS CLAIMS: "That was a jolt, no question about it. This is the time of year that the labor department has traditionally had a great deal of difficulty adjusting for normal seasonal variations. There is evidence that maybe the jobs situation in July was worse than we thought."  WIN THIN, SENIOR CURRENCY STRATEGIST, BROWN BROTHERS HARRIMAN,  NEW YORK: "(GDP) was a little weaker than expected. But it's still old data. It's Q2. Overall (the data) didn't have a lot of terrible new news behind this. Jobless claims were higher than expected. I think people don't want to go too far out ahead of Friday's jobs report. That's the first snapshot of Q3. I'm not sure we'll get much more move now given that we have more important data tomorrow."  DEMOCRATIC REP. BARNEY FRANK OF MASSACHUSETTS, SPEAKING ON CNBC: "These new jobless claims numbers today underline the need for a second stimulus."  SUBODH KUMAR, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, SUBODH KUMAR &ASSOCIATES, TORONTO:     "At first glance, the 1.9 percent on GDP is OK, even though it might be slightly below consensus. What the data tells us is that stock market volatility will continue. So I don't see the risk of the market collapsing because of recession fears. That risk is low. Jobless claims numbers continue to suggest weakness on the consumer side."  GARY THAYER, SENIOR ECONOMIST, WACHOVIA SECURITIES, ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI: "Treasuries prices rose because the GDP numbers were weaker than expected with the economy growing just 1.9 percent in the second quarter compared to some expectations for 2.3 percent growth. In addition, the government revised down its estimate of GDP growth in the fourth quarter of 2007 to a negative number -- minus 0.2 percent -- so it looks like the economy was closer to recession than the previous data indicated. "Jobless claims jumped much more than expected last week to 448,000. Claims were expected to be down slightly so this was another sign that the economy is close to or in recession. The problem is that claims are very volatile in July because of auto plant retooling. But the trend still is toward higher jobless claims."
