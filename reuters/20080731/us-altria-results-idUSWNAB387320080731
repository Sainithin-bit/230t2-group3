 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Altria Group Inc ( MO.N ) on Thursday posted quarterly profit that slightly beat analysts estimates and said market share for its Philip Morris USA unit's cigarettes rose. 

 The company also stood by its full-year profit forecast, while price increases and lower expenses helped boost earnings from continuing operations. The parent of Marlboro cigarette maker Philip Morris USA said profit from continuing operations was 45 cents a share in the second quarter, compared with 34 cents a share a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, earnings were 46 cents a share, compared with the 45-cent average analyst estimate compiled by Reuters Estimates. Altria spun off the Philip Morris International tobacco business at the end of March, so net income fell to $930 million, or 45 cents a share, from $2.22 billion, or $1.05 a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 4 percent to $5.05 billion. Revenue, excluding excise taxes, was $4.18 billion, compared with the average analyst estimate of $4.03 billion compiled by Reuters Estimates. Philip Morris USA's cigarette market share rose to 51 percent from 50.5 percent a year earlier, with the top-selling Marlboro brand commanding 41.8 percent of the U.S. market, up from 41 percent a year earlier. Altria has also been expanding into smokeless tobacco and other products, as well as cutting costs, to help lift profits amid a shrinking U.S. tobacco market.
