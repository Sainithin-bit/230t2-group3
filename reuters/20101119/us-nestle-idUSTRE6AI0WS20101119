 ZURICH  (Reuters) - Nestle ( NESN.VX ), the world's biggest food group, said on Friday it will change its sales recognition policy to reflect international standards, a move which is expected to reduce reported sales by 15 percent. 

 The Vevey-based maker of Nescafe coffee, KitKat chocolate bars and Maggi soup, said the change would be effective on January 1, 2011, and would bring it in line with the generally accepted interpretation of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). Expenses such as discounts and promotions for retailers will in future be deducted from the proceeds of sales, Nestle said, leading to the reduction in reported sales but an increase in profit margins. Net profit, earnings per share and cash flows would be unaffected, the group said. Nestle also said it would communicate 2010 figures, restated under the new policy, separately after publishing 2010 results to allow for comparability to results to be published from 2011 onward.
