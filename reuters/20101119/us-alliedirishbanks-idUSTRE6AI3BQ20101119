 DUBLIN  (Reuters) - Allied Irish Banks (AIB) will have to tap central bank funding to plug a 13 billion euro ($18 billion) outflow in deposits, mostly from business customers, since the start of the year. 

 AIB said on Friday the government would underwrite a 6.6 billion euros rights issue at 50 cents per share, up from 5.4 billion originally. Corporate depositors have been pulling money out of Irish banks amid uncertainty about the sector, and the European Union and IMF are preparing a possible aid package to shore up the industry and prevent its woes destabilizing the euro zone. "General funding market conditions in recent months have become increasingly challenging," AIB said on Friday. Last week, larger rival Bank of Ireland signaled a 10 billion euro outflow of corporate deposits in the third quarter while bancassurer Irish Life & Permanent said it had suffered a 600 million outflow in the same period. Both companies said deposit levels had since stabilized. AIB shares, which hit a peak of over 24 euros in 2007 when Ireland's property boom was at its height, were up 6.7 percent at 44.5 euro cents at 1600 GMT. Once Ireland's largest listed lender, AIB is relying on the government to bail it out after years of loose lending to property developers left it with a capital hole of at least 10 billion euros. AIB had hoped to plug half that hole with asset sales but a failure to find a buyer for its British business, which accounts for at least 10 percent of the group's impaired loans, meant the government will now have to stump up more funds. "The (deposit outflow) figure is not a major surprise. There is no surprise in there," said one Dublin-based dealer. Ireland convert 2.9 billion euros of preference shares as part of the AIB rights issue, likely leaving it with a stake of around 95 percent. Crashing commercial property prices triggered Ireland's banking and sovereign crisis and investors now fear rising residential mortgage arrears could be the next black hole for beleaguered banks. AIB said domestic mortgage arrears continued to rise in the three months to end-September but the rate of increase slowed from the preceding quarter. It said bad debt charges remained elevated and were broadly in line with expectations. At its first-half results, AIB said nearly 16 percent of its loans were impaired. The government parachuted David Hodgkinson, a veteran British banker, as executive chairman of AIB last month and he has started a comprehensive review of its operations and targets, including credit charges.
