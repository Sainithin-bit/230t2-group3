 BRUSSELS, Nov  (Reuters) - Finnish Finance Minister Jyrki Katainen said on Wednesday it was "quite obvious" that Ireland would need outside financial help, but an official review of the country's financial health would be concluded in "a few days or weeks." 

 EU finance ministers agreed on Tuesday that a joint IMF, ECB, European Commission mission would go to Ireland this week to assess the health of its state finances and banks, after mounting turmoil in Irish debt markets. "For me personally, it is difficult to believe that Ireland wouldn't need any outside financial help. The purpose of the mission is to find the right ways to restructure the financial sector and make it healthier than it is at the moment," Katainen said. "I think that it's quite obvious that some outside help is needed but we haven't decided anything concerning this yet... I think the process will be quite quick and after a few days or weeks we will know more." Katainen said the mission aimed to draw a line under Ireland's emergency funding requirements. "It is exactly why we need this consultation now because we cannot simply afford neither as the Irish government neither as the EU to go through an endless process where there are growing liquidity needs and there are growing needs for recapitalization," he said. "We need to know which structure to support, and what support is needed," he said. (Reporting by  Daniel Flynn  and  Bate Felix )
