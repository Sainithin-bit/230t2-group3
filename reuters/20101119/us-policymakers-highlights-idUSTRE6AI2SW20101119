 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Following are highlight quotes from policymakers at the European Banking Congress and a European Central Bank conference, both taking place in Frankfurt. 

 FEDERAL RESERVE CHAIRMAN BEN BERNANKE On currencies/imbalances: "Deficits and surpluses are generated by many countries behavior, not a single currency. "I agree deficit countries have to do their part, which means improving savings versus investment. "I do think things can be done to improve the savings rate in the United States. "It will be very difficult for exchange rates by themselves to restore the balance and so I think structural adjustments on both sides are necessary." On QE2: "Buying government securities significantly moved asset prices. "We think the effect on activity will be meaningful. I agree we don't want to overpromise. The effects are meaningful but moderate." IMF MANAGING DIRECTOR DOMINIQUE STRAUSS-KAHN "The crisis is still here in Europe." On Greece: "I am very confident in the possibility for Greece to go back on track. The government has been very bold and put in place what has to be done." "When we share currency we share constraints." On currencies/imbalances: "The idea we can solve the imbalances problem without important changes in the relative values in the currencies is something that I just cannot understand. "I understand the difficulties but we need to move in that direction." On G20: "There will be good G20s and bad G20s ... I am rather optimistic that over one or two years a global consensus can emerge on G20 issues." On growth: "I think that wherever it's possible supporting growth is still absolutely necessary and even if the support to growth creates some side problems." "If ... for example, the United States economy could go to 4 percent growth or it could fall down to 2 percent or less the consequences for the world economy will be huge, so we have to keep this in mind." On capital controls: "We all know the right way to deal with capital inflows when they make a big pressure on the currency. The right way is to have an increase in the value of the currency. "My feeling is there should be maybe not a code of conduct but at least a framework qualifying the way to act." On regulation/markets: "There is still a lot to do because regulation is fine and necessary but there are three pillars: regulation, crisis resolution and financial supervision. On financial supervision we have not done enough. "There is a long list of problems that have not been resolved. On supervision and financial resolution we have a list of problems that have to be addressed." ECB PRESIDENT JEAN-CLAUDE TRICHET On current situation: "The magnitude of uncertainty is certainly something we feel." "The reason why we still see in the major economies of the advanced world still the presence of these non-standard measures is because we are still in the situation which is not the normal situation." On imbalances: "Imbalances are a major, major issue. My remark would be first as regards the constellation of imbalances, a single market with a single currency, namely the euro area, has to be considered as a single entity. "If we do not converge in terms of reducing imbalances at the global level, we will still have the recipe for the next crisis. This is absolutely capital. In that domain, we are not making the progress that we should." (Speaking to Bernanke) "You know to which extent we strongly share the view a strong dollar vis-a-vis the other major floating currencies is very important and the view that you have expressed ... vis-a-vis surplus countries with exchange rates that are insufficiently flexible." ECB'S WEBER "It's more the credit-fueled asset prices we have to worry about. "We cannot have stable prices without stability-oriented fiscal policy. "We made very clear this (bond-buying) is a transitory measure. All crisis intervention measures are transitory ... When it stops, it better stop sooner rather than later." GERMAN FINANCE MINISTER WOLFGANG SCHAEUBLE On joint euro bond issuance: "Common euro bonds would breach the principles of the European Monetary Union." On bond-holder penalties: "We need collective action clauses at the issue of a bond, where investors can make a majority decision. Such clauses do not disturb investors in other parts of the world, so why should they disturb here in Europe. "I am certain that market participants have priced in that possibility ... so such a solution could rather calm the markets and reduce spreads by bringing clarity." "The German economy is coming out of the crisis better than we expected. "All governments in the euro zone must stick to their commitment to reduce deficits. "Financial, economic and political consequences of a sovereign debt crisis in Europe would be difficult to control. That's why it was correct for the euro zone decided quickly to Greece. "We must use the time up to 2013 to design a mechanism to succeed the EFSF." "We cannot postpone exit strategies, they must be implemented step by step." BANK OF ENGLAND'S TUCKER "Something we have to be incredibly vigilant about going forward is that we don't let that (current higher inflation) slip into medium-term inflation expectations. So far that hasn't happened and in fact we think it's most likely that our inflation rate will come back to our target of 2 percent or possibly even bit below because of the extent of the slack we have in the economy." "Our inflation rate is above our target of 2 percent ... it isn't a sign of vibrancy, although our economy is recovering. It is a reflection of three things: First is an increase in indirect taxes, and there is another one to come, and that feeds through to price level. Second one is the rise of commodity prices around the world ... and the third is, as a country with its own currency, we have had depreciation that will help to rebalance our economy slightly away from government spending and consumption more toward exporting." "We see a distinction between those asset bubbles that are associated with credit and those that are not ... this is not about asset prices, this is about credit." BRAZILIAN CENTRAL BANK PRESIDENT HENRIQUE MEIRELLES "It's simply a fact that there are global imbalances and policies being done, and as a result we have capital inflows that might create distortions and each central bank has to address that. "We do think an integrated approach is important. If we have an economy with an imbalance between demand and supply, and forex appreciation and capital inflows, we have to address all these situations. "We have tightened our policies to bring domestic demand growth to a more sustainable level ... and at the same time we are addressing current account imbalances. "We should work toward global coordination but every jurisdiction has to be very clear about protecting its economy from imbalances." GREEK FINANCE MINISTER GEORGE PAPACONSTANTINOU On Ireland: "The case of Ireland is quite different from the other countries, in Ireland the problem has been the banking system. "We are now at a point where decisions have to be taken ... it will have to decide whether to ask for help or not, time is of the essence." On debt restructuring and haircuts: "(Debt payment) extension, if it comes, will be a recognition of what has been done, not a substitution of what should have been done. "If you open now discussion, which includes debt restructuring and haircuts, then I think people underestimate the damage this could have, the damage to the Greek economy, the Greek banking system, all the collateral damage to the rest of Europe. It would send an absolutely wrong signal, it would not solve anything and it would create damage to other peripheral countries." COMMERZBANK CEO MARTIN BLESSING On the European debt crisis: "I am not 100 percent sure we are already out of the financial crisis. We still have to cope with the crisis that has developed from the financial crisis becoming a global recession, and now I think we move to a stage with a crisis of government debt. "We now have to get the euro zone weather-proofed." THOMAS MIROW, PRESIDENT OF EUROPEAN BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT "It is difficult to predict the potential channels of contagion. "I trust problems in Ireland are being correctly addressed. "The effects (if there were a slowdown in the euro zone) would have serious consequences ... nonetheless, I expect average growth of 4 percent in eastern Europe in 2010." MEXICAN CENTRAL BANK GOVERNOR AGUSTIN CARSTENS "There are concerns about the issue of bail-ins," he said, referring to the idea of the private sector being involved in the cost of any sovereign debt restructuring.
