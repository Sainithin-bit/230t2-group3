 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - A rescue package for Ireland would not be enough to prevent contagion of its financial woes to other countries in the euro zone, a poll of participants at a European Banking Congress showed on Friday. 

 In the on-the-spot survey of participants at the congress, most of whom were bankers, almost three quarters said such aid would not prevent contagion. The survey was conducted by the organizers of the event, which had 380 registered attendees. The organizers did not say how many attendees responded. The vast majority -- 88 percent -- expected the European Monetary Union to survive the next 10 years, with 70 percent believing Greece would still be a member of the euro zone in 10 years time. However, 67 percent said Greece would not fully meet its financial obligations in the coming 10 years. Greek Finance Minister George Papaconstantinou said discussing potential sovereign debt restructuring operations would not be helpful. "If you open now discussion, which includes debt restructuring and haircuts, then I think people underestimate the damage this could have -- the damage to the Greek economy, the Greek banking system, all the collateral damage to the rest of Europe," Papaconstantinou said during a panel discussion. "It would send an absolutely wrong signal. It would not solve anything, and it would create damage to other peripheral countries," he added.
