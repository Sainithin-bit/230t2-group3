 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said on Friday that a bailout package for Ireland could put an end to the debt crisis that has been roiling Europe since the spring. 

 Asked in an interview on Bloomberg Television whether an aid package for Ireland from the European Union and the International Monetary Fund could be the last bailout needed, Geithner said: "I think that is absolutely possible." "It is within the capacity of the Irish Government and the European authorities to achieve, and I believe they will achieve that because this government, Ireland, has demonstrated that they are willing to do some very, very difficult, very, very hard things to dig their way out of this mess," he said.
