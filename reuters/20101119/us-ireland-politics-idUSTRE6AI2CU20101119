 DUBLIN  (Reuters) - An IMF/EU-sponsored rescue package that people in Ireland see as a loss of sovereignty may deal the killer blow to Fianna Fail, the governing party that sees itself as the embodiment of Irish nationalism. 

 Although the 2011 budget is likely to pass when it come to a vote next month, unease runs deep in Prime Minister Brian Cowen's Fianna Fail or "Soldiers of Destiny" party, whose roots lie in Ireland's war of independence from Britain. Cowen's insistence that an aid package for the banks does not mean a bailout or a loss of sovereignty for Ireland has raised hackles across the country and on his own backbenches. "In terms of the foundations that were laid by that party in the area of sovereignty, it's probably the ultimate irony that it's that administration that's now presiding over this mess," said Diarmaid Ferriter, Professor of Modern Irish History at University College Dublin. The founders of Cowen's party -- which lists maintaining Ireland's sovereignty in its constitution -- began a civil war in 1921 because they felt a settlement struck with former masters Britain fell far short of full independence. Although some argue Ireland gave up much of its sovereignty by joining the European Union in 1973, voters overwhelmingly backed a referendum to do so and enjoy being part of Europe. Aid from Brussels helped fuel the country's rags to riches story in the 1990s but now Irish people are angry at having to go cap in hand to overseas powers. LAUGHING STOCK With a parliamentary by-election looming next week, the timing of the joint IMF/EU mission that arrived in Ireland on Thursday could not be worse. Cowen's government was never expected to win the seat in the northwestern county of Donegal on November 25 but opinion polls show the candidate for Sinn Fein coasting to victory. Such a result for Sinn Fein, a left-wing nationalist party from which Fianna Fail emerged in the 1920s and known internationally for its links to guerrilla group the Irish Republican Army (IRA), will further rankle Fianna Fail MPs. Some of Sinn Fein's views on the economy have drawn support from surprising quarters, including the country's most prestigious economic think-tank, and its Belfast-based president Gerry Adams is going to contest the Republic's next election. Cowen's parliamentary majority will be cut to just two after the Donegal vote, meaning he will be ever more reliant on junior coalition partner the Greens and a clutch of Independents. With the government's majority expected to be wiped out following two more by-elections, likely in April, most analysts expect an early parliamentary election will be called in the first-half of next year. Scenting victory ahead, Enda Kenny, the leader of the center-right opposition party Fine Gael and the likely future prime minister, has looked to rile Fianna Fail. "This is a democracy and people died on the street for it, it will not be closed down by incompetence. It will not become the laughing stock of Europe," he said in parliament this week. Kenny has said he expects the government to push through next month's 6 billion euros of tax hikes and expenditure cuts and says his party will not support the budget in the national interest. But if it looks like Cowen will not get the numbers on December 7 there is the possibility that opposition MPs will abstain to help the budget go through. COMICAL ALI The exact terms of any international loan agreed over the coming days -- or indeed how the government is able to present it to its MPs -- will be crucial, according to Noel Whelan, a barrister and political commentator. "If the public see it as a collapse of Ireland's financial standing, it could actually have such a dramatic effect on the political system that it will begin to behave irrationally which would give rise to an inability to pass the budget," he said. "However ... if the government can get across that it is essentially a very big overdraft facility with funds to be draw down if and when the bank system needs them, then it would not be so traumatic and would likely assist the passage of the budget." The problem for Cowen is that his government's repeated denials that it was even discussing aid has deepened public mistrust and prompted some local commentators to compare him to "Comical Ali," the nickname of the propaganda chief of Saddam Hussein's Iraq. Even if Cowen passes the budget, the humiliation of a bailout could set his party up for a historic drubbing. A spectacular property crash on Fianna Fail's watch has the party's support at a record low -- one recent poll put it at just 18 percent, meaning over half its deputies would lose their seats next time out -- and a bailout could alienate previous diehard supporters. Hammering the point home, the Irish Times, voice of the country's establishment, said Fianna Fail was compromising Irish sovereignty after a period when -- thanks to little national debt, a halt in mass emigration and a peace agreement in Northern Ireland -- it had never been stronger. "To drag this state down from those heights and make it again subject to the decisions of others is an achievement that will not soon be forgiven. It must mark, surely, the ignominious end of a failed administration," the newspaper said. (Editing by Carmel Crimmins and  Sonya Hepinstall )
