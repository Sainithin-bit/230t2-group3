 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - E-commerce coupon site Groupon Inc is considering selling itself to Google Inc, according to media reports on Friday. 

 The two are in discussions about an acquisition for more than $3 billion, reported the technology blog AllThingsD, citing anonymous sources, on Friday. Groupon is a privately held, Chicago-based company which was launched about two years ago. The company, which sends its members daily emails with about 200 deals, is present in 250 markets in North America. The deals are activated only when a minimum number of people agree to make a purchase, giving Groupon clout to negotiate steep group discounts. "There is nothing for us to comment on. These are just rumors," said Groupon spokeswoman Julie Mossler. A Google spokesman said the company does not comment on rumors or speculation. Groupon is weighing whether to sell itself to Google or to proceed with a round of fundraising, according to a separate report by Bloomberg on Friday. Groupon told Reuters in August that it had attracted interest from big technology companies. Its president, Rob Solomon, said then, "We have no plans at all right now to sell, or an IPO, the only plans are to grow." (Editing by  Bernard Orr )
