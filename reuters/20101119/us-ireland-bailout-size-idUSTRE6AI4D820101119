 DUBLIN  (Reuters) - A financial aid plan to help Ireland cope with its batter banks will be unveiled next week, EU sources said on Friday. 

 Ireland's central bank governor Patrick Honohan has said the country will likely end up with a loan running into tens of billions of euros. EU sources told Reuters the package could be in the range of 40-90 billion euros. The size of the aid will depend on whether it will just cover the recapitalization of the banks and some of their financing needs or also include the government's medium-term sovereign borrowing requirement. Here are the potential costs of each: RECAPITALISATION Barclays Capital expects the IMF program to provide a buffer against both expected and unexpected losses in Ireland's banks, which it calculates to be around 22-37 billion euros. This takes into account its estimate for total Irish bank recapitalization of up to 48.5 billion euros. Goldman Sachs estimates gross credit losses for domestic banks over a five-year cycle to be 35-58 billion euros, but much are already provisioned for. Other analysts say the regulator will target a stricter equity tier one capital ratio of 12 percent, compared with the current target of seven percent. NCB Stockbrokers estimates that rising the ratio by 1 percentage point would cost 850 million euros each for Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland, resulting in a cost of 8.5 billion euros for them both. FINANCING NEEDS: Banks in Ireland borrowed 130 billion euros from the European Central Bank as of end-October although part of this was lent to foreign banks based in the country. Barclays Capital estimates that 95 billion euros of the 130 billion was lent to domestic Irish banks. On top of that, Irish banks borrowed nearly 35 billion euros in special liquidity assistance from their own central bank by the end of October. SOVEREIGN BORROWING REQUIREMENT: The Irish government expects to borrow around 63 billion euros in the three years to 2013. COST OF PACKAGE: Based on the example of Greece, which received a three-year loan from the IMF and EU of 110 billion euro in May, the Irish aid package would be three-year loans at a floating rate of either SDR or euribor plus 300 basis points, and a further one-off service charge of 50 bps for loans up to three years. Honohan said this week the lending rate was likely to be in the 5 percent territory and some of the loans are in SDRs and euros. (Editing by Carmel Crimmins, Ron Askew)
