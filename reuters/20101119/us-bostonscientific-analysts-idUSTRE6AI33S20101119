 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Medical device maker Boston Scientific Corp ( BSX.N ), which is reshaping itself as it sells off unprofitable businesses and buys new ones, told Wall Street analysts it can boost profits in the near future, sending shares up more than 3 percent on Friday. 

 In Boston Scientific's first analyst meeting in four years, Chief Executive Officer Ray Elliott said the company can increase profitability over the next two years and improve sales in two to four years. He also predicted that the shares, which closed 3.2 percent higher at $6.77 on Friday, will rise by $5 within the next three years, saying the company will deserve a higher multiple. "This is what the savings programs and the cost-cutting efforts would produce in operating profit. We simply were translating a bunch of savings into a theoretical multiple," he said in a telephone interview after the meeting. "Sales can't grow much more than single digits," Elliott told analysts at the Plaza Hotel in New York. "The same is not true for profitability." Chief Financial Officer Jeff Capello declined to provide a financial forecast for 2011, but he expects to end 2010 with $1.6 billion in cash on the balance sheet and expects to generate $7 billion in cash flow in the next five years. In addition, he said there is still room for margin improvement and targeted gross margins of 72 percent by 2015. Analysts expect the company to end the year with gross margins in the high 60 percent range. The meeting was closed to the media, but was webcast. The Natick, Massachusetts-based company has struggled with product recalls, regulatory issues, market share losses, lawsuits and a heavy debt load since its ill-fated acquisition of Guidant Corp in 2006. Since Elliott took the helm in July 2009, the company has restructured, sold some businesses and acquired others, paid down debt and resolved regulatory and legal problems. Still, growth in its key cardiac rhythm management and heart stent markets has been stagnant and pressure on prices of all medical devices remains problematic industrywide. 'DON'T LONG FOR THE GOOD OLD DAYS' "People don't believe we can deliver growth, but quietly and carefully we've put a plan together to do just that," Elliott told analysts. "The key for us is: Don't long for the good old days." He said management has reallocated R&D resources, reshaped its sales organization and launched other growth initiatives, including a sharper focus on more efficient manufacturing facilities and on emerging markets. Boston Scientific will invest $30 million to $40 million in emerging markets and establish clinical trial hubs in India and China to conduct research at a lower cost. The company also announced on Friday it will buy Sadra Medical Inc, which is developing aortic valve replacements that can be implanted using a catheter. Transcatheter valves, as they are known, are one of the hottest areas in the medtech sector. Last month, it acquired Asthmatx Inc, which makes devices that use catheters in a procedure to treat severe asthma. It recently sold its business that makes devices used to treat stroke, aneurysm and other vascular conditions in the brain to Stryker Corp ( SYK.N ) for $1.5 billion. Boston Scientific's president of its neuromodulation business gave a presentation detailing plans to take the business from its current applications in pain management to deep brain stimulation. The unit is up for sale, but bankers said it was not attracting a satisfactory bid and that the company was prepared to withdraw. Elliott declined to comment on the status. He said Boston Scientific has the ability to make larger acquisitions, even now. "Their focus is the exact opposite of Stryker's or Covidien Plc's ( COV.N )," noted one Wall Street analyst who declined to be named due to his company's policy. "They're buying (assets) to get into new areas. Boston is getting bigger where they're already big." Elliott, a Canadian who often uses hockey references to make his point, said the company will get where it needs to be by correctly predicting where the hockey puck will be next. Boston Scientific currently makes devices that treat cardiovascular disease, hypertension, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes and digestive disorders, including cancer. It also makes devices and products used in urology. "We are in 28 markets. Some are growing more than others and some aren't growing at all," he said. Boston Scientific recorded sales of $8.2 billion in 2009. (Reporting by Debra Sherman; editing by John Wallace,  Andre Grenon  and  Matthew Lewis )
