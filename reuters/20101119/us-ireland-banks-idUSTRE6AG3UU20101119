 DUBLIN  (Reuters) - Ireland is likely to adopt a two-step plan to shore up its banks if it accepts an European-IMF bailout, focusing first on stabilizing their funding and then stress-testing them to gauge capital needs. 

 This could help wean the banks off European Central Bank support and end uncertainty, once and for all, over the final bill for cleaning up the shattered banking sector. Ireland pledged on Wednesday to work with a team from the European Commission, the IMF and the European Central Bank (ECB) who will arrive in Dublin on Thursday to assess what level of assistance the Irish banks need. Irish banks, shut out of the capital markets, have borrowed as much as 130 billion euros ($175.5 billion) from the ECB, representing nearly a quarter of all loans from the eurozone central bank. This increasing dependence on the ECB has put the spotlight on the sector's funding situation, which makes investors nervous and puts the banks under more pressure. Dublin and Frankfurt are keen to stop this vicious cycle, especially as the ECB prepares to scale back its liquidity program next year. "A structured solution where term liquidity is provided to the government... and subsequently filtered through to the banks on a collateralized basis would shift liquidity risk from the ECB to a more permanent solution," said Michael Cummins, head of advisory and credit solutions at Glas Securities. "This could potentially calm fears with respect to bank funding and stabilize market sentiment. Adequate bank recapitalization would be the next stage." The deterioration in investor sentiment put pressure on deposits with Irish Life & Permanentm which said on Wednesday it had suffered a 600 million euros outflow of corporate deposits in the third quarter. Bank of Ireland said last week its loan to deposit ratio had risen to 160 percent from 145 percent, indicating a 10 billion euro outflow of corporate deposits in the third quarter. Deutsche Bank estimates that the Bank of Ireland's loan to deposit ratio could rise to over 200 percent from the current 160 percent if 17 billion euros of ratings-sensitive capital markets deposits were withdrawn. "We think it unlikely that open-market funding costs for Irish banks will be economic in the near term, pressuring equity book values, credit availability, the cost of debt and asset prices," Deutsche Bank said in a note to clients. "Into next year... difficulties could be compounded by an ECB move to limited size competitive tender auctions for three month funding." ESCALATING BAILOUT BILL Dublin's worst-case estimate last September for dealing with years of reckless lending by its banks would top 50 billion euros ($70 billion), nearly a third of economic output. But after a ratcheting-up of earlier "worst-case scenarios," investors don't believe the estimates. Analysts say neither the government nor Europe probably know yet what the final number would be. "We are in a state of complete psychosis. There are different sources reporting different numbers. I have seen everything between 60 to 100 billion euros. I don't think they have an idea themselves," said Constantin Gurdgiev, head of macroeconomics at the Global Center for Economic Development. European Union sources have told Reuters that Ireland could receive an overall bailout of between 45 billion and 90 billion euros, depending on whether it needs help only for its banks or for public debt as well. In parliament, Prime Minister Brian Cowen insisted the focus of talks with the IMF and Europe would be the banks not the sovereign, which is fully funded until the middle of next year. But any application for funding from the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), set up in the aftermath of the Greek crisis, has to come from the government. Since Ireland has guaranteed bank liabilities, any bank bailout could be seen as an effective sovereign bailout. "The loan from the EFSF will be a pure sovereign loan and the taxpayer cannot run away from that," said Gurdgiev. Finance Minister Brian Lenihan said in an interview on Wednesday that fresh funding might not be necessary. "What may be required may not in fact be an actual transfer of money now but demonstration of how much money can be made available if further difficulties materialize," Lenihan said. But he also said stress tests would have to be repeated. The last time the Irish central bank stress tested the banks in March, government funding costs were as low as 4.5 percent and the proportion of residential mortgages in arrears was 4.1 percent. The rate on Irish 10-year paper has spiraled toward nine percent and mortgages in arrears has risen to 5.1 percent, according to data from the central bank on Wednesday.
