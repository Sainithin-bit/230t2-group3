 SYDNEY/LONDON  (Reuters) - Airbus A380s operated by Qantas Airways may be grounded for weeks as Rolls-Royce plans how to fix an engine problem which forced one of the superjumbos into an emergency landing, sources said. 

 "It is a very complex process and it is still in the early stages," said an Australian-based source with direct knowledge of the situation and who asked not to be named because they were not authorized to discuss the issue. "I expect Rolls and Qantas are still several weeks away from putting together an action plan and its documentation." Qantas grounded its fleet of six Airbus A380s, pending an investigation, after a Rolls-Royce Trent 900 engine failed on November 4. A delay would squeeze the Australian airline's capacity as it heads into the busy holiday season. "Rolls are still coming up with a plan on how to go about the fix so I very much doubt whether there is an exact timeline in place" said a source familiar with the company who wished to remain nameless. Shares in British enginemaker Rolls-Royce and Qantas have suffered since the accident, both falling more than 7 percent. Rolls-Royce shares were down 1.6 percent at 594 pence by 7:00 p.m. EST, while Qantas closed 2.6 percent lower at A$2.67. Talk of an extended delay came a fortnight after the incident, which has been followed by a frenzy of media speculation surrounding the cause, cost and long-term impact, and which has put Rolls-Royce under pressure. Rolls-Royce said last week the failure was confined to a specific component in the engine's turbine and it would replace the relevant module according to an agreed program. Qantas has lost about 4-5 percent of its seat capacity and around $1 million per day because of the grounding, according to analysts, who said Rolls-Royce will face compensation claims from other A380 operators, Lufthansa and Singapore Airlines. Airbus will also seek compensation from Rolls-Royce for any disruption caused by plans to re-assign engines. "The cost of this (for Rolls-Royce) could affect not only 2010 but also spread into 2011 as the fixing could take longer and as EADS is asking for compensation," said Credit Agricole analyst Antoine Boivin-Champeaux. Qantas's costs will likely escalate quickly if it cannot get the A380s back in the air for the busy southern hemisphere year-end summer travel period which starts next month. A Qantas spokeswoman said the airline had no time schedule to put the A380 back in service and remained engaged with Rolls-Royce to resolve the issue. Australia's Civil Aviation Safety Authority will have to make a final approval before Qantas can resume A380 flights. On Thursday, Qantas chief executive Alan Joyce said the world's fleet of Airbus A380 aircraft may need to replace around 40 Rolls-Royce engines or about half of the total in service, to ensure safety. Airbus said the engine failure sent three different fragments flying, which cut wires and resulted in systems and structural damage, according to a technical bulletin seen by Reuters.
