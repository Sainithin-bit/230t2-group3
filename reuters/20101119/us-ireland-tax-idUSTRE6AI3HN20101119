 PARIS  (Reuters) - Ireland's ultra-low corporation tax rate, a magnet for foreign investment over the last decade, is at the center of a tug-of-war between Dublin and its European partners over an expected financial rescue. 

 The government is simultaneously seeking tens of billions of euros in EU and IMF assistance to cope with the huge liabilities of its shattered, state-guaranteed banks, and refusing to contemplate any increase in the iconic 12.5 percent tax rate. Finance Minister Brian Lenihan said on Thursday he had made clear to all international partners that the tax rate was "an absolute red line," and Deputy Prime Minister Mary Coughlan said it was "non-negotiable." Yet the finance ministers of France and Austria and a senior German lawmaker have all said that the business tax, long seen by higher-tax European countries as unfair competition, should be addressed in the negotiations. It may be hard to explain to European taxpayers, facing spending cuts and tax increases at home, why they should lend money to the wealthier-than-average Irish if Dublin is unwilling to raise more revenue itself from business. Ireland has strong economic reasons for wanting to keep a low rate that attracted U.S. multinationals such as Google, Microsoft, eBay and Intel, which have created tens of thousands of jobs. "Any simple economics textbook will tell you that a small, open economy built heavily on foreign capital should set a low corporate tax rate," says Philip Lane, professor of international macroeconomics at Trinity College, Dublin. There are also political arguments. The corporate tax rate has become a symbol of sovereignty in a nation that had to fight hard for independence from Britain a century ago. The Irish were promised before they ratified the EU's Lisbon treaty at the second attempt in a referendum last year that they would retain full freedom to set their own taxes. GROWTH OR BUST Ireland's transformation from a poor, agrarian country until the 1980s into one of the most prosperous and dynamic economies in Europe was built on two pillars -- generous European Union subsidies and low corporate tax. But the Irish now have 128 percent of the EU average gross domestic product per capita. Only a few years after Dublin was weaned off EU cohesion and structural funds, it suddenly needs emergency aid to shore up banks ruined by a real estate bubble. Corporation tax yielded 3.9 billion euros ($5.45 billion) in 2009 and is expected to bring in at least 3.1 billion euros this year, about 10 percent of government revenue. Each extra percentage point of corporate tax would raise roughly 300 million euros. Under its four-year austerity program, the government needs to cut the budget deficit by at least 6 billion euros next year and achieve 15 billion euros in savings by 2014. That may mean further cuts to public sector pay and pensions, new taxes on property and water, lower student grants and higher university fees. Yet no mainstream political party is calling for higher taxes on business. The consensus is partly because the 12.5 percent rate -- the second lowest in the EU -- was introduced by a center-left Labour party finance minister, Ruairi Quinn, in 1997. One possible compromise might be to impose a one-off levy or a temporary surcharge on corporations. But economists say the low corporate rate creates jobs and spending in Ireland which generate higher income tax and value added tax revenue as well. "Everyone agrees that you have to have economic growth in Ireland or nothing else will work," Lane said. He questions the premise that Ireland is drawing investment away from other European countries. Many of the global firms with operations in Ireland are in fact selling software services such as online advertising back to the United States, he says. Furthermore, some European multinationals take advantage of Ireland's system to reduce their tax bill at home, enabling them to keep less profitable production in other EU countries. Only Bulgaria and Cyprus, which charge 10 percent, have lower corporate tax rates in the European Union. Latvia takes 15 percent and most "emerging Europe" economies, which compete with Ireland for foreign investment, have rates around 19-20 percent. However Lane says OECD figures show the effective tax take on business in Ireland is closer to the European average because there are fewer exemptions and allowances than, say, in Germany. A senior executive at U.S. drug maker Pfizer, which employs more than 5,000 people in Ireland with a capital investment of over $7 billion, said he could not imagine that the EU would force Dublin to make itself less competitive. "I find it difficult to believe that Europe would make us even more uncompetitive by forcing us to do anti-competitive things and damage the economy by saying we have to remove one of our competitive tools," said Paul Duffy, vice-president of manufacturing for Pfizer in Singapore and Ireland. But not everyone believes that if Ireland were to raise its corporate tax by a few points to Baltic levels, multinationals would rush to abandon their Irish bridgehead in the EU's single market with its flexible, English-speaking workforce. "If we went to 15 percent, or even 17.5 percent, we'd still be lower than most," said Alan McQuaid, chief economist at Bloxham Stockbrokers in Dublin, who argues that a "minor tweak" to corporate tax would not do much damage and would be seen by ordinary Irish people as an act of social justice. "If we have a weak hand (in negotiations with the EU), that might be the thing to trade off." French Economy Minister Christine Lagarde also argues that Dublin has some room to raise corporate tax without killing the goose that lays the golden eggs. "We will have to see how these rates can be changed without weighing down the Irish economy and driving away investors, because we would be shooting ourselves in the foot and Ireland would be guaranteed to have to come back to the (loan) window," she said.
