 LONDON  (Reuters) - The premium investors demand to hold Irish, Portuguese and Spanish debt over German Bunds will fall as default worries ease, but the process may take time, a senior IMF official said on Friday. 

 "Markets are overreacting in the sense that the risk of default in the countries in Europe under pressure is overestimated," the head of the International Monetary Fund's fiscal affairs department Carlos Cottarelli told Reuters. Asked whether spreads for Ireland, Portugal and Spain would come down, he said: "Yes of course ... I would expect this, but it's going to take time. After the beginning of an adjustment process ... it may take up to 18 months before things calm down." Cottarelli rejected concerns the Irish debt crisis would spread to other vulnerable euro zone economies such as Spain and Portugal. "I don't see a domino effect, I see cases of specific countries with fiscal problems." (Reporting by  Christina Fincher  and Paul Day; editing by  Patrick Graham )
