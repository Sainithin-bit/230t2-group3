 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Women's clothing retailer AnnTaylor Stores Corp ( ANN.N ) posted a higher-than-expected profit and forecast strong results for the holiday quarter, sending shares soaring to a two-year high. 

 Like other chains that cater to women over 35, such as Talbots Inc TLB.N and Chico's FAS Inc ( CHS.N ), Ann Taylor is benefiting from improved demand and a fashion overhaul. "We are prepared for a competitive promotional environment and in fact have seen evidence that many retailers, particularly those serving the middle-income consumer, are already getting aggressive," Chief Executive Kay Krill said on a conference call. "Our goal is to gain our fair share of her spend, while at the same time preserving margins." Net income surged to $24.2 million, or 41 cents per share, in the third quarter ended October 30, compared with $2.1 million, or 3 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, it earned 42 cents a share, beating analysts' expectations as polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S by 8 cents. Total sales rose 9.3 percent to $505.3 million, above analysts' expectations of $492.8 million. Same-store sales increased 11.7 percent overall, with a 21.9 percent rise at the Ann Taylor brand and a 4.5 percent increase at the more casual and less expensive LOFT chain. AnnTaylor shares rose as high as $26.11 -- their highest level since September 2008 -- and were still up $1.89, or 8 percent, at $25.64 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Chico's fell 0.4 percent and Talbots rose 1.3 percent. SELLING MORE AT FULL PRICE Gross profit margins came in ahead of expectations at 57.2 percent of sales, up from 55 percent in the second quarter and similar to last year. One factor cited by the company was higher full-priced selling at the Ann Taylor brand. "AnnTaylor is benefiting from significantly better merchandise at both Ann Taylor and LOFT, which, coupled with incremental marketing, is driving better traffic, solid e-commerce growth, and overall full price selling," UBS analyst Roxanne Meyer said in a research note. She has a "buy" rating on the stock. The company forecast total sales in the fourth quarter approaching $500 million and a mid- to high-single-digit percentage increase in comparable sales in the period, which includes the holidays. It expects double-digit same-store sales growth at the namesake brand and low single-digit growth at LOFT. FBR Capital Markets analyst Liz Dunn, in a research note, nonetheless called the company's outlook conservative. "We are clearly expecting strong results for that period," Chief Financial Officer Michael Nicholson said. For the full fiscal year, the company expects net sales approaching $1.97 billion and positive same-store sales growth at both brands. Analysts were expecting sales of $495 million in the fourth quarter and $1.95 billion for the year. The company has been closing weak stores under a restructuring program, but said some previously slated for shuttering are doing better and will now remain open. It has reduced the number of planned 2010 closures to 43 from 56. (Reporting by Ben Klayman in Detroit, additional reporting by Phil Wahba in New York, editing by Gerald E. McCormick, Dave Zimmerman)
