 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Gap Inc ( GPS.N ) stood by its 2010 profit outlook in advance of the key holiday selling season after posting a slight decrease in quarterly net profit that met Wall Street estimates, even with tepid sales growth. 

 The owner of the Gap, Old Navy and Banana Republic chains -- which has been waiting to see sales at its domestic stores perk up on a sustained basis -- repeated a 2010 earnings range of $1.77 to $1.82 per share first issued in May. Wall Street has been expecting earnings of $1.82. "I think there were probably some people hoping they would take up the annual guidance ... but why would you take it up in this environment?" asked Needham & Co Christine Chen. Gap, which has been expanding globally this year, has seen success with certain items, such as a black pants launch and a revamped jeans line, but sales have remained sluggish and somewhat erratic. Same-store sales, a key gauge of retail performance, were flat in the third quarter. Chief Executive Glenn Murphy has expressed frustration about the slow pace of improvement at Gap stores, where the company has tried to improve merchandise to better appeal to its target shoppers. "I actually think they've made pretty good progress, but it takes time when you have such a large chain of stores," said Chen. "It's hard to please so many constituencies." Murphy told analysts on a conference call that Gap was still fine-tuning the balance between fashion and basic items, but a speedier supply chain was helping the company respond. Still, he cautioned that consumers were still somewhat wary, with sales trends choppy, and that rival retailers would be aggressive in aiming to take market share. "We are not expecting the Q4 from a consumer sentiment perspective or from the level of promotional activity to be better than it was in Q3," said Murphy. "So that is our mind set coming in to the important Q4." Similarly on Thursday, teen retailer American Eagle Outfitters ( AEO.N ) posted third-quarter profit in line with Wall Street's expectations as revenue rose a mere 2.1 percent. The company, which is trying to improve operating margins and spur sales for its casual apparel amid intense competition, cited "meaningful progress" and said it was less reliant on promotions to move merchandise in the quarter. American Eagle said it would delay giving a fourth-quarter profit outlook until early December following the key Thanksgiving shopping weekend. The retailer also said it would discontinue reporting monthly sales beginning in fiscal 2011. COLORLESS HOLIDAY For the holiday, CEO Murphy said Gap was making a "huge investment" in black denim. Analyst Chen said she is waiting to see how Gap's shoppers react to the holiday merchandise, which is more polished and "trend-right" than in years past, but does not include a lot of color. One of Gap's most successful holiday campaigns in 2002 included bright striped scarves that shoppers bought as gifts. "If you think of it as a gift-giving season ... people like to buy red sweaters at Christmas," she said. "People like to buy something bright and cheery. You're probably not going to buy (someone) a black sweater." Net profit in Gap's third quarter fell 1 percent to $303 million, or 48 cents per share, from $307 million, or 44 cents per share, a year earlier. There were fewer shares outstanding in the third quarter of this year than in the year-earlier period. Revenue rose 2 percent to $3.65 billion, above the $3.58 billion expected by Wall Street. Gap said it expects inventory per square foot at the end of the fourth quarter up in the high single digits compared with the year-ago quarter. It said it would close about 100 stores for fiscal 2010, most of them Gap stores, slightly lower than a previous estimate of 110 stores. The company's shares fell half a percent to $20.80 following its earnings report after closing at $20.91, up 1 percent, on the New York Stock Exchange. American Eagle shares gained 2.8 percent to close at $16.29 after reporting its earnings in the morning. (Reporting by Alexandria Sage; editing by  Robert MacMillan ,  Gary Hill  and  Andre Grenon )
