 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - A weaker dollar is a side effect of U.S. monetary policy, not the goal, and the dollar should regain value once the economic recovery becomes more robust, a Federal Reserve official said in comments released on Friday. 

 "As growth strengthens, the value of the dollar should adjust accordingly," New York Federal Reserve Bank Executive Vice President Terrence Checki said in a speech to the Economic Club of New York. Checki, who is in charge of emerging markets and international affairs at the New York Fed, said declines in the value of the dollar are about what might be expected in light of the economic slowdown and changes in interest rates and inflation expectations. He said monetary policy would help spur growth and job creation but could not by itself "provide the answers to all of the uncertainties." "Monetary policy can potentially ease the headwinds we currently face and help reduce some of the downside risks, but it is not a cure-all for the challenges facing our country," he said. The United States must gradually shrink its budget deficit, he said. The Fed's decision to jolt the recovery by buying $600 billion of longer-term Treasury securities has generated disapproval at home and abroad. International critics have alleged the United States is fueling growth by weakening its currency at the expense of other exporting nations' growth.
