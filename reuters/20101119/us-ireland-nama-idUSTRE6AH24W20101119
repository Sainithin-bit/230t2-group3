 DUBLIN  (Reuters) - Ireland "bad bank" expects to finish its task of taking over all 73 billion euros of high-risk loans from the country's banks in the coming weeks, the chairman of the National Asset Management Agency (NAMA) said on Thursday. 

 Frank Daly said he expected NAMA would pay over 30 billion euros for the loans. NAMA's Chief Executive Brendan McDonagh said the overall discount would come in at around 58 percent. "The discounts on these loans have been in line with the estimates provided by the (Finance) Minister in his statement," Daly told a parliamentary committee, referring to a banking statement made by Brian Lenihan on Sept 30.
