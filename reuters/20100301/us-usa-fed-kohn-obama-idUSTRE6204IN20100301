 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - President Barack Obama will nominate a replacement for retiring Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Donald Kohn quickly and hopes that his nominee will be quickly confirmed, a White House spokesman said on Monday. 

 "He'll seek to nominate somebody quickly and hopes that they can be quickly confirmed," White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said at his daily briefing. The White House had said earlier Obama would announce a nominee in time for confirmation before Kohn's term ends on June 23. (Reporting by  Patricia Zengerle ; Editing by  Eric Beech )
