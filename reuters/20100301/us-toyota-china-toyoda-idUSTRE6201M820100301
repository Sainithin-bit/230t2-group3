 BEIJING  (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp ( 7203.T ) President Akio Toyoda on Monday offered a sincere apology to Chinese consumers over its massive global recall, which has had limited impact in the Chinese market. 

 Consumers in China need not worry about the Prius or Lexus brands as the faulty parts behind the recalls on those models are not being used in China, Toyoda told a roomful of more than 300 reporters in Beijing. Toyota's China woes have been relatively limited so far, with the company recalling 75,552 RAV4 vehicles there due to faulty accelerators. Toyoda is reported to have flown directly from the United States to China to meet with government officials and local reporters, underscoring the importance of an auto market that surpassed the United States last year to become the world's largest. Toyoda was grilled by U.S. lawmakers last month for a series of recalls that have tarnished the carmaker's brand and reputation for quality, particularly in the United States, its largest market.
