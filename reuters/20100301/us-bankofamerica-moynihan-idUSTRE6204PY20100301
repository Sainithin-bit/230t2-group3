 CHARLOTTE, North Carolina  (Reuters) - Bank of America Corp ( BAC.N ) Chief Executive Brian Moynihan said on Sunday during a television interview that he will vote for U.S. Representative Barney Frank, a key proponent of financial industry reform, in the upcoming November election. 

 Moynihan, who joined Bank of America when it purchased FleetBoston Financial in 2004, resides in Frank's Boston-area Congressional district. Moynihan, in an interview with New England Cable Network on February 28, said he plans to vote for the Massachusetts Democrat, who heads the U.S. House Financial Services Committee and is a central figure in the ongoing debate about financial regulatory reform. Moynihan praised Frank's ability to navigate consumer and industry interests to find common ground. "He has an amazing ability to fit them together," Moynihan said during the interview. The ongoing financial regulatory debate has been a key issue in all of Moynihan's public speeches since taking over for his predecessor Kenneth Lewis on January 1. Moynihan has come out more strongly in favor of general industry reform, particularly around leverage and risk-taking at large institutions that jeopardize the broader financial system.
