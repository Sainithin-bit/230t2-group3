 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rose for a second straight day on Monday, boosted by AIG's record-setting deal to sell a major Asian unit and on gains in semiconductor shares after SanDisk Corp raised its revenue forecast. 

 Hopes for an agreement to resolve nagging uncertainty surrounding debt-laden Greece also encouraged investors. American International Group Inc ( AIG.N ) jumped 4.4 percent to $25.85 after Britain's Prudential Plc ( PRU.L ) agreed to buy its AIA Group insurance arm for $35.5 billion. That and other merger and acquisition news lifted sentiment because it suggests corporate managers see purchases of other companies as a way to drive growth. "The market always loves merger and acquisition activity because it means people or other companies are finding value out there in the market place," said Scott Marcouiller, senior equity market strategist at Wells Fargo Advisors in St. Louis, Missouri. SanDisk Corp ( SNDK.O ) climbed 11.9 percent to $32.63 after the flash memory maker raised its revenue forecast for the first quarter late Friday and said the outlook for the industry in the coming years is strong. The PHLX Semiconductor index .SOXX added 3.1 percent. [ID:nN26219612] There were also some positive signs from the economy after disappointing data last week. U.S. consumer spending increased slightly faster than expected in January while the U.S. manufacturing sector grew. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  gained 78.53 points, or 0.76 percent, to 10,403.79. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  added 11.22 points, or 1.02 percent, to 1,115.71. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  rose 35.31 points, or 1.58 percent, to 2,273.57. Stocks have been strong recently, with the S&P 500 rising for seven of the last ten sessions. "It's been a pretty good mix of groups today, so you've had strong underlying leadership too, and the rally has been quite broad," said Marcouiller. The S&P 500 is now off only 3 percent from a 15-month closing high reached on January 19. It had fallen by more than 8 percent from the peak through February 8. Adding to Monday's gains were signs that Athens might be nearing a deal with European Union governments for some form of emergency aid. U.S.-listed shares of National Bank of Greece ( NBGr.AT )( NBG.N ) rose 2.3 percent to $3.95. Millipore Corp ( MIL.N ) surged 11.1 percent to $104.90 a day after Germany's Merck KGaA ( MRCG.DE ) agreed to buy it for about $6 billion in cash. The NYSE Arca Biotech index .BTK jumped 5.7 percent, led by OSI Pharmaceuticals Inc OSIP.O, which advanced 51.9 percent to $56.25 after Japan's Astellas Pharma Inc ( 4503.T ) launched a $3.5 billion hostile bid for the company. On the economic front, data from the Institute for Supply Management showed the U.S. manufacturing sector grew in February, though the pace was slower than economists polled by Reuters forecast. In addition, government data showed U.S. consumer spending increased slightly faster than expected in January as consumers dipped into their savings while incomes rose slightly. About 7.57 billion shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange and Nasdaq, well below last year's estimated daily average of 9.65 billion. Advancing stocks outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a ratio of nearly 4 to 1, while on the Nasdaq, about three stocks rose for every one that fell.
