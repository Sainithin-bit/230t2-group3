 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Britain's Prudential Plc ( PRU.L ) plans to do a rights offering of about $20 billion to finance a $35.5 billion purchase of American International Group's ( AIG.N ) Asian life insurance unit, a source familiar with the situation said on Sunday. 

 Prudential's rights offering will be backstopped by Credit Suisse ( CSGN.VX ), HSBC ( HSBA.L ) and JPMorgan Chase ( JPM.N ), the source said, declining to be named because the deal is not yet public. Prudential plans to pay about $10.5 billion of the purchase price in equity, and that would include about $5.5 billion in common stock, the source said. AIG was advised by Citigroup ( C.N ) and Goldman Sachs ( GS.N ), while its board was advised by Blackstone Group ( BX.N ), the source said. Credit Suisse, Lazard Ltd ( LAZ.N ), JPMorgan and HSBC advised Prudential, the source said. (Reporting by  Paritosh Bansal ; Editing by  Diane Craft )
