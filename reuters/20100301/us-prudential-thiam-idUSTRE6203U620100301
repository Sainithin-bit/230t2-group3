 LONDON  (Reuters) - A French-speaking, former Ivory Coast government minister may not be an obvious choice for the top job at Britain's largest insurer, but Tidjane Thiam has made his mark at Prudential with a transformational deal after just five months at the helm. 

 Thiam, poached by Pru from archrival Aviva in 2007 to become chief financial officer, has been the driving force behind a $35.5 billion deal to buy the Asian assets of bailed-out U.S. giant American International Group Inc, turning the UK group into the largest foreign-owned insurer in Asia. The deal was initially attempted a year ago, under former chief executive and Asia veteran Mark Tucker, but prices were too high for a market still reeling from the financial crisis. At the time, AIG's AIA unit would have cost roughly the same as French giant AXA. In the end, Thiam, 47, was the man who clinched the acquisition, less than a year after he was appointed chief executive, with a deal described by one UK banking veteran on Monday as "ballsy" and very much led by the soft-spoken former McKinsey man. Thiam was appointed CEO a year ago but did not take up the job until October. "He's an incredibly clever man and very charming," said analyst Kevin Ryan at ING. "He's one of these guys who's a bit of a polymath -- a genuinely impressive guy." ARSENAL FAN Thiam, a tall, striking figure in well-cut suits, is a very French presence in an overwhelmingly domestic British insurance industry. A high-flyer, he is also the first black chief executive of a FTSE 100 company -- a description he tends to shirk -- and was named last year the second-most influential black Briton, behind the founder of mobile operator Celtel, Mo Ibrahim. The son of a journalist, he was brought up in Morocco and was later educated alongside France's intelligentsia at the elite Ecole Polytechnique and Ecole Superieure des Mines. He joined McKinsey in 1986. Thiam was lured back to Ivory Coast in the 1990s, where he served in a number of government roles, including minister of Planning and Development. He left the country after the December 1999 military coup forced him back to management consultancy. The charismatic Thiam, a fervent football fan and Arsenal supporter, was headhunted by Aviva in 2002, serving initially as head of strategy and later as chief executive of its European business -- and named frequently as a contender for the top job. But he was picked out by Prudential in 2007, in an appointment that surprised the industry, despite an apparent lack of experience and just over a year after Aviva made an ill-fated bid for its rival. He moved into the finance director's chair at Pru just months before Tucker's announcement he would step down earlier than expected propelled Thiam to the top spot. Thiam is popular in the industry and in the analyst community where he has been praised as "the coolest man in insurance" -- a relative outsider able to charm investors with the nuances of an arcane industry.
