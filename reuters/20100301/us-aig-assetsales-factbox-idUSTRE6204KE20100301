 (Reuters) - American International Group Inc ( AIG.N ) 

 agreed to sell its Asian life insurance business, American International Assurance, to Britain's Prudential Plc ( PRU.L ) for about $35.5 billion in the largest insurance deal ever. The deal, expected to close at year-end, is the insurer's largest asset sale since its September 2008 rescue and will help the U.S. government get back billions of dollars of bailout funds. AIG still has about a dozen assets on the block. It is also in advanced talks to sell another foreign life insurance business, American Life Insurance Co (Alico), to MetLife Inc ( MET.N ).
