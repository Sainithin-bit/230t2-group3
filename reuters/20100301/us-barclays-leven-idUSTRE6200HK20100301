 HONG KONG  (Reuters) - Barclays Plc ( BARC.L ) has hired former Goldman Sachs ( GS.N ) banker Johan Leven as co-head of corporate finance in Asia-Pacific, as the British bank continues its push as a full-fledged investment bank. 

 Barclays Capital, or BarCap, as the Barclays investment banking division is better known, said in a statement on Monday that Leven would share the responsibility with Richard Gallivan and the two would report to Matthew Ginsburg, head of investment in Asia-Pacific. Ginsburg was poached from Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ) about six months ago, with a mandate to build an investment banking franchise in Asia for Barclays from scratch. BarCap is in the midst of building out its equities business in Asia. As part of that plan, BarCap had almost completed its Japan equities rollout and Hong Kong was next in line, Ginsburg told Reuters in an interview on Friday. Leven was previously at Goldman Sachs where he was most recently co-head of mergers and acquisitions for Asia ex-Japan. Leven and Gallivan will lead industry and country coverage groups in Asia-Pacific and manage key client relationships in Asia, which is seen as the most important growth region by many global banks.
