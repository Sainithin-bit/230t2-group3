 ATHENS  (Reuters) - Corruption and impunity from prosecution lie at the heart of Greek's debt crisis, Prime Minister George Papandreou said on Monday, calling on citizens to stomach the pain required to put the country back on track. 

 "The crisis in our country is not limited to our fiscal problem. It is only the tip of the iceberg," Papandreou said at a cabinet meeting. "It is extremely urgent to deal with it because it has assumed dramatic dimensions." (Reporting by  Dina Kyriakidou ; writing by  Paul Hoskins )
