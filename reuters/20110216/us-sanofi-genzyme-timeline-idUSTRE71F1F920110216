 (Reuters) - French drugmaker Sanofi-Aventis SA agreed to buy Genzyme Corp for $20.1 billion in cash, plus payments tied to the success of the company's drugs, the companies said on Wednesday. 

 Here is an account of Sanofi's efforts to buy Genzyme: 2010 May 23 - Sanofi Chief Executive Chris Viehbacher approaches Genzyme CEO Henri Termeer about a deal. Termeer says he is open to discussing a transaction, but asks to wait until after the company's shareholder meeting in June as he tries to fend off a proxy battle with key shareholder Carl Icahn. June 9 - Genzyme announces settlement with Icahn and appoints two directors designated by the financier. June 28 - Viehbacher calls Termeer to set up a meeting. Termeer says he will respond soon. July 2 - Media reports say Sanofi mulls a large U.S. biotech acquisition. July 7 - Termeer tells Viehbacher he cannot commit to a meeting until after Genzyme's board meets on July 9. July 10 - Termeer tells Viehbacher Genzyme's board has discussed a potential transaction with Sanofi, but has decided it was not the right time to explore such a deal. July 28 - Sanofi's board revisits a proposed transaction with Genzyme. Viehbacher proposes sending Genzyme a letter outlining the terms of an acquisition. July 29 - Viehbacher tells Termeer about Sanofi's plan to send a written proposal, including a price per share. The subsequent letter outlined Sanofi's $69 per share offer. August 11 - Termeer tells Viehbacher Genzyme's board has rejected Sanofi's offer. August 29 - Sanofi publicizes its offer for Genzyme, which Genzyme publicly rejects a day later. September 20 - Termeer and Viehbacher meet to discuss Sanofi's proposal. Termeer refuses to give guidance on a value for Genzyme and suggests Sanofi withdraw its offer and consider making contact again in 2011. October 4 - Viehbacher takes Sanofi's offer directly to Genzyme shareholders. October 22 - Genzyme hosts an investor meeting to explain why it's worth more than Sanofi's offer. November 26 - Termeer says in a newspaper interview he is open to a deal linking Genzyme's value to the success of Lemtrada drug by using a contingent value right (CVR). 2011 January 24 - Sanofi extends tender offer until February 15. January 31 - Genzyme says it allows Sanofi to conduct due diligence. Sources tell Reuters the two have reached a basic agreement on deal terms pending the review. February 15 - Sources tell Reuters Sanofi agrees in principle to buy Genzyme for $19.2 billion cash plus CVR. February 16 - Sanofi announces it has struck a deal to buy Genzyme for $74 per share plus a CVR that could trade at $2-3 per share. Sanofi says the deal is worth roughly $20.1 billion and is expected to close early in the second quarter. (Editing by  David Holmes )
