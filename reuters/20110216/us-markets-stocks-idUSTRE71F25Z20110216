 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The S&P 500 rose on Wednesday to twice its value from just two years ago, a bounce whose vigor has not been seen since the Great Depression. 

 Stocks were boosted by Dell earnings and deal announcements fueling hope for more gains, but light volume makes the recent move more tenuous. The market overcame concerns about tensions between Israel and Iran, and indexes slowly climbed back to close near the session's high. "It seems that there's just a lot of pent-up demand, and the market is very quick to shrug off news that could appear negative," said Angel Mata, managing director of listed equity trading at Stifel Nicolaus in Baltimore. Still, volume struggled to match the year's average of 7.9 billion shares on the New York Stock Exchange, NYSE Amex and Nasdaq. About 7.5 billion shares changed hands on Wednesday. The S&P 500 closed above 1,333.58, double the intraday low hit in early March 2009. On a closing level, the market has risen more than 96 percent since March 9, 2009 --a run not seen in such a short period of time since 1936, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at Standard & Poor's. The steep advance on relative low volume has sparked many forecasts for a correction. "You have still a healthy degree of skeptics out there," Mata said. "You never want the market to be too bullish." Dell Inc DELL.O, the world's No. 2 personal computer maker after Hewlett-Packard, flew past Wall Street's profit and margins estimates late on Tuesday, and its shares jumped 11.9 percent to $15.56. HP shares ( HPQ.N ) gained 2.1 percent to $48.99. Two Iranian warships planned to sail through the Suez canal en route to Syria on Wednesday, an Israeli official said, calling it a "provocation" by the Islamic Republic. The pullback following the comments was another opportunity for money on the sidelines to get back into stocks, Mata said. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  gained 61.53 points, or 0.50 percent, to 12,288.17. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  rose 8.31 points, or 0.63 percent, to 1,336.32. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  added 21.21 points, or 0.76 percent, to 2,825.56. Advancing stocks outnumbered declines on the NYSE by a ratio of 3 to 1. On the Nasdaq, more than nine stocks rose for every five that fell. Crude and basic materials shares again gave the market direction, with the energy sector of the S&P 500 .GSPE up 1.3 percent and materials .GSPM up 1.2 percent. Oil services provider Halliburton Co ( HAL.N ) closed at its highest level since July 2008 after a 4.3 percent climb to $47.49. Further boosting energy shares, Brent crude settled up more than 2 percent near $104 a barrel on concerns over the Israel-Iran tension. French drugmaker Sanofi-Aventis SA ( SASY.PA ) agreed to buy Genzyme Corp GENZ.O for $20.1 billion in cash. Genzyme shares rose 1.1 percent to $75.10. In another proposed deal, activist investor Nelson Peltz's Trian Group offered to acquire Family Dollar Stores Inc ( FDO.N ) for $55 to $60 per share in cash, giving the company an implied value of $7.6 billion. Family Dollar soared 21.1 percent to $53.25. Trian's bid for Family Dollar helped shares of other discount retailers. Dollar Tree Inc ( DLTR.O ) was up 3 percent to $52.45 while Dollar General Corp ( DG.N ) rose 10.1 percent to $29.64. In economic news, U.S. core wholesale prices rose in January at the fastest rate in more than two years, raising some concerns about inflation. But economists brushed off inflation concerns and said the recovery was too weak for a big spike in consumer prices. (Reporting by Rodrigo Campos; Editing by Dan Grebler)
