 BERLIN  (Reuters) - Jens Weidmann, set to become the next president of the Bundesbank, will bring youth, political savvy and a new low-key style to the staid German central bank, but also the tough inflation-fighting views of his predecessor and former mentor Axel Weber. 

 Just 42 years old, Weidmann has spent the last five years as Chancellor Angela Merkel's top economic adviser, wielding major influence over policy as Germany struggled to contain the financial crisis and its worst recession since World War Two. People who have worked closely with him say Weidmann's quiet, almost shy, manner belies a sharp economic mind, strong opinions and a feel for politics that Weber, who came to the Bundesbank directly from academia, often seemed to lack. "He has his own opinions but doesn't try to ram them through aggressively," Bert Ruerup, who worked with Weidmann between 2000 and 2003 as a member of the German government's "wisemen" council of economic advisers, told Reuters. "On the policy front, he is very close to Weber. He's very stability-oriented." Weber shocked Germany and its European partners last week by announcing plans to resign from the Bundesbank in April, a year before his term was to end, and pulling out of the race to become president of the European Central Bank. He had alienated other countries in Europe, notably France, by coming out publicly against the ECB's decision to buy the bonds of struggling euro zone members -- a move ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet agreed to reluctantly at the height of Greece's debt crisis last May. If Weidmann's time in Berlin is any indication, public policy outbursts like Weber's will be a rarity, if they occur at all. Like Merkel herself, he has shown a preference for doing his jousting in private. Last year, he quietly supported Economy Minister Rainer Bruederle's right to reject aid for Opel, the European arm of U.S. carmaker General Motors, even though Merkel was in favor of providing assistance to safeguard German jobs. He urged Merkel to resist quick aid for Greece and to involve the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in any European aid program, winning both arguments over the opposition of Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble. Putting distance between himself and the chancellor in his new post and embracing his newfound status as a public figure, after a career of influencing policy from the shadows, will be among Weidmann's biggest challenges as Bundesbank president. German opposition parties have criticized the appointment as political and Weidmann will need to demonstrate his independence from Berlin at a time when central banks around the developed world face pressure to use extraordinary measures to shore up weak economies, or hold off on tightening policy despite the re-emergence of inflation. HUGELY INFLUENTIAL The Bundesbank no longer enjoys the power it did before the creation of the ECB a dozen years ago. But its president remains hugely influential in the debates that take place in the shiny glass headquarters of the young bank that sets monetary policy for the 17-nation euro zone, by virtue of its reputation as an uncompromising inflation fighter and Germany's status as Europe's biggest economy. The Bundesbank still boasts more than 9,000 core staff and its president can draw on a powerful economics department for research. The German central bank also supervises the financial sector in Germany. Despite Weidmann's relative youth, Ruerup said he did not expect him to have trouble seizing control of and setting the agenda in the Bundesbank. "It will be a challenge for him, but when you look at the current board there are no strong rivals. From an economic expertise perspective, he will be as dominant as Weber was," Ruerup said. Weidmann studied economics in Aix-en-Provence, Paris and Bonn, where Weber served as one of his doctoral dissertation advisers. He did internships at the Bank of France, the German economy ministry and the central bank of Rwanda before joining the IMF and becoming the top adviser to the five German "wisemen" -- a role where Ruerup says he built consensus and motivated his team with a quite, calm effectiveness. From 2003 to 2006 he headed the monetary policy analysis department at the Bundesbank in Frankfurt, where his wife and two children remained when he got the call from Merkel to come to Berlin. In his early years in the German capital he was dubbed one of "Merkel's boys," along with her foreign policy adviser Christoph Heusgen and European affairs adviser Uwe Corsepius, but few people use that moniker anymore despite Weidmann's schoolboy looks. He will become the youngest president of the Bundesbank. (Writing by Noah Barkin, editing by Mike Peacock)
