 MELBOURNE  (Reuters) - Top global miner BHP Billiton nearly doubled its first-half profit to an all-time high on soaring iron ore, copper and oil prices. 

 *********************************************************** KEY POINTS * H1 profit before one-offs $10.7 bln vs $10.3 bln consensus * Interim dividend 46 cents vs 49 cent consensus * Plans $10 billion capital return * Sees industry-wide cost pressures * In advanced stage of approving major coal, iron ore projects * Sees global market volatility but optimistic on long-term outlook COMMENTARY GLYN LAWCOCK, ANALYST, UBS "They flagged that the company will be spending $80 billion over the next five years on project growth ... we need to see more details of what projects will be involved. "When you consider $80 billion over the next five years plus the commitment to the $10 billion return, plus the underlying commitment to progressive dividend, they are pretty well consuming a lot of their operating cash flow. "The most important thing is being able to investment in your business which has the best return. What we need to see now is more color around the $80 billion. The biggest headwind for all these companies is the macro environment, which they have very little control." TIM BARKER, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, BT INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT "The capital management program of A$10 billion with an end date at the end of this year may be seen as a surprise. We expected to hear an announcement about it. Maybe A$10 billion is at the upper end, and the end of this year maybe a bit early. "Costs are probably a bit higher than I had expected. Underlying costs and keeping capital spending under rein is the biggest headwind at the moment. "We'd like to see cash be used effectively and a significant portion of the excess returned to shareholders." JAMES BRUCE, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, PERPETUAL INVESTMENTS "The result itself is in line with market expectations in almost all regards. The speculation was there would be a A$10 billion buyback, and there is. "The biggest surprise is the commitment to spend A$80 billion over the next five years. We think that this demonstrates the challenges that the industry is having satisfying rising demand, while replacing declining production from mature operations. "Ultimately this is why we believe that commodity prices will remain above their long term trend for the next couple of years. "Clearly, BHP has a strong view of the demand coming to be spending that amount of capital. NEIL BOYD-CLARK, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, ARNHEM INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT "It looks to be a pretty robust set of numbers. I think it's ahead of market expectations and I think the $10 billion capital management initiative will be well received." RIC RONGE, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, PENGANA CAPITAL "It seems to be a slightly better than expected number. Capital management of $10 billion is largely as expected although we need to see the details to provide some comfort." (Reporting by the Australia bureau)
