 PARIS  (Reuters) - French drugmaker Sanofi-Aventis has agreed to buy Genzyme Corp for $20.1 billion in cash, plus payments tied to the success of the company's drugs, the companies said on Wednesday. 

 Below are some key facts about Sanofi, currently the world's fourth-largest drugmaker by sales according to IMS Health, and Genzyme, a pioneering biotechnology company which specializes in drugs for rare diseases: SANOFI HISTORY Sanofi-Aventis is the product of numerous mergers and acquisitions. It became the world's third-largest drugmaker in 2004 when Sanofi-Synthelabo -- formed by merging subsidiaries of Total and L'Oreal in 1999 -- bought Aventis. Sanofi named Chris Viehbacher as chief executive at the end of 2008. He has been diversifying the group into areas like animal health and consumer health to deal with the loss of patent protection on top-selling drugs that will dramatically hurt sales through 2013. Sanofi has about 102,000 employees in 100 countries.

It said this did not include any benefit from a Genzyme deal, nor the damaging effects of a return of generic copies to cancer drug Eloxatin. GENZYME HISTORY Genzyme was founded in 1981 by Henry Blair, an enzymologist who had been collaborating with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to develop a treatment for Gaucher disease. For more than 25 years, it has been led by Henri Termeer, a Dutchman. Based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Genzyme has about 10,000 employees and posted revenue in 2009 of $4.5 billion.
