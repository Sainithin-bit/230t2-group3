 STUTTGART, Germany  (Reuters) - Daimler ( DAIGn.DE ) stuck with its stance on Wednesday that it was hard to understand why French authorities suspected the German carmaker of insider trading in shares of Airbus parent EADS ( EAD.PA ). 

 "Daimler was assigned the status of an accused party in the French investigation concerning the sale of EADS blocs of shares by Daimler and Lagardere ( LAGA.PA ) in April 2006," Chief Financial Officer Bodo Uebber said, according to a speech text distributed at the company's annual results conference. "We consider the entire process to be extremely unusual and difficult to understand." Daimler said last week it had been placed under formal investigation in France over alleged insider dealing in EADS but was confident of being cleared. No mention was made in the prepared remarks about speculation over a possible sale of Daimler's 22.5 percent of voting shares in EADS. (Reporting by  Christiaan Hetzner ; Writing by  Maria Sheahan )
