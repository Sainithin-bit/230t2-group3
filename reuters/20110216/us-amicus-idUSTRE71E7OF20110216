 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Amicus Therapeutics Inc is preparing to invade the rare disease space that has been dominated by Genzyme Corp, with an eye on taking significant market share. 

 There may not be many patients with Fabry disease, but Amicus Chief Executive John Crowley believes his company's experimental drug Amigal could treat all of them. "We think actually 100 percent of Fabry patients could be eligible to take our drug," Crowley said in an interview at the BioCEO & Investor conference in New York. He believes some 50 percent of Fabry patients have the right genetic mutation to benefit from Amigal in lieu of their current enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). For the other half, Amicus thinks Amigal could be used in combination to enhance the safety and efficacy of other ERTs, such as Genzyme's market leading Fabrazyme. Patients with Fabry disease lack a specific enzyme and the condition is fatal without lifelong treatment. It affects only about 5,000 to 10,000 people worldwide. Genzyme, which is in very advanced talks to be acquired by French drugmaker Sanofi-Aventis, had virtually owned the sector, selling some of the world's most expensive drugs for extremely rare genetic disorders. But a plant contamination led to severe shortages of Fabrazyme and its Gaucher disease treatment, Cerezyme, allowing rivals to gain a foothold. Amicus, which is enrolling patients in a pivotal late stage clinical trial of Amigal, was not able to take advantage of the Fabrazyme shortage. But Crowley believes that crisis opened a lot of eyes to the dangers of one supplier. "We think in some respects it encouraged patients and physicians to look at alternative therapies," Crowley said. "It's good for people to have options for the treatment of rare diseases. Hopefully that will be helpful in getting people to think about continuing to enroll in our study," he said. Amicus expects to complete enrollment in the study by the middle of this year and have critical data by year's end. Crowley declined to speculate on how quickly Amigal could hit the market, but it is eligible for an expedited six-month review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Asked if approval by the end of next year was being too optimistic, Crowley said: "It's not unfair, but we need to get the data first and see what it tells us. But I promise you we'll move incredibly quickly with GSK to get it there." Crowley said the company has plenty of cash to see Amigal through to approval without having to raise money, thanks in no small part to its tie-up with GlaxoSmithKline. The Amicus therapeutic platform got a huge shot of validation last October when Glaxo licensed the rights to Amigal and bought a nearly 20 percent stake in the company. "I think it was absolutely transformational for Amicus. It put us back on a lot of people's radar screens," Crowley said of the Glaxo deal. "People know the significant scientific rigor at GSK. I think that gave a lot of people increased confidence in the Amigal program and also in the platform, that there is a lot more we can do," he added. Under the deal, Glaxo will sell the drug with milestone payments and royalties on sales going to Amicus. Crowley would not speculate on whether Glaxo will set a price comparable to Fabrazyme, which can cost up to $200,000 per year, or sell the pill at a significant discount. "It could potentially be a more efficacious therapy and it could potentially be a safer therapy. With that product profile I think GSK will have a pretty broad range of options in terms of how they price the drug," Crowley said. "We're both committed to making sure the drug is fairly priced and broadly accessible. But these will always be expensive therapies," he added. It remains to be seen whether any health insurers or government programs would be willing to pay for the combination therapy of Amigal and Fabrazyme that Amicus envisions for some patients. Amicus is also planning to soon begin early stage clinical trials of treatments for Pompe and Gaucher disease, which also would compete with Genzyme drugs, and for the much less rare Parkinson's disease, which is prevalent among Gaucher patients. Crowley for a time ran the Pompe program at Genzyme after a company he founded was bought by Genzyme in 2001. He had very high praise for Genzyme CEO Henri Termeer, but would shed no tears over the company's looming absorption by Sanofi. "I don't think we should get nostalgic in this business."
