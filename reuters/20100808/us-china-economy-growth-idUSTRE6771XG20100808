 BEIJING  (Reuters) - China's economy will enjoy a strong, stable second half, putting it on course for full-year growth of about 10-11 percent, a leading government economist said in comments published on Monday. 

 The forecast by Zhang Yutai, head of the Development Research Center, a think-tank under China's cabinet, is more bullish than those of many independent economists, who have been revising down their predictions to the 9-10 percent range. "Provided that that fiscal expenditures achieve the target of an 11.4 percent increase this year, 2010 GDP growth should be about 10 percent," Zhang was quoted as saying by the Shanghai Securities News. "If fiscal expenditures top the 11.4 percent target, and domestic and external demand don't drop sharply in the second half, then this year's GDP rise should be about 11 percent," he said.
