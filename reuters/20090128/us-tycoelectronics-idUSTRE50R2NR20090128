 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Tyco Electronics Ltd ( TEL.N ) reported weaker-than-expected results amid sluggish U.S. and European auto markets and falling demand for components used in consumer products, sending shares of the maker of electronic connectors down nearly 9 percent. 

 The company, which also said on Wednesday to expect a loss in the current quarter, posted a net loss of $37 million, or 8 cents per share, for the first quarter ended December 26, compared with a year-earlier profit of $949 million, or $1.90 per share. Excluding charges, Tyco Electronics earned 22 cents a share from continuing operations, 3 cents below analysts' forecasts, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue fell 21 percent to $2.81 billion, compared with Wall Street forecasts for sales of $2.93 billion. The company, which also makes wireless systems and undersea fiber optic networks, said it was operating in an unprecedented environment, and sales to its largest market -- automotive -- fell 31 percent. Sales of components to the computer and communications markets were also down by double digits. The quarter was disappointing, Collins Stewart analyst Brian White said in a research note. "We expect Tyco Electronics' stock to remain under selling pressure in light of the company's weak March quarter outlook and the challenges we foresee in coming months related to the auto and other consumer-related markets," said White, who rates Tyco Electronics at "sell." The stock was down $1.35, or 8.6 percent, at $14.39 in early trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Tyco Electronics, which was spun off in 2007 from former parent Tyco International Ltd ( TYC.N ), forecast sales in the second quarter would fall 32 percent to 35 percent, and said it would post a loss from continuing operations of 10 cents to 15 cents per share, including restructuring costs of about 20 cents a share. Analysts were looking for second-quarter earnings of 35 cents per share. (Reporting by Nick Zieminski; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn)
