 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - President Barack Obama said on Wednesday that he was confident the downtrodden U.S. economy can be turned around provided that everyone pitches in. 

 After a White House meeting with top business executives, Obama told a press conference it was necessary that everyone "chips in so that we can climb our way out of this crisis, executives and factory floor workers" said it must happen without delay. (Reporting by  Glenn Somerville )
