 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - The following is a summary of recent comments by Federal Reserve policy-makers: 

 * Denotes 2009 voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets U.S. monetary policy. FOMC STATEMENT, JAN 28: "The Committee continues to anticipate that economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for some time. "Information received since the Committee met in December suggests that the economy has weakened further. Industrial production, housing starts, and employment have continued to decline steeply, as consumers and businesses have cut back spending. Furthermore, global demand appears to be slowing significantly. Conditions in some financial markets have improved, in part reflecting government efforts to provide liquidity and strengthen financial institutions; nevertheless, credit conditions for households and firms remain extremely tight. The Committee anticipates that a gradual recovery in economic activity will begin later this year, but the downside risks to that outlook are significant. "In light of the declines in the prices of energy and other commodities in recent months and the prospects for considerable economic slack, the Committee expects that inflation pressures will remain subdued in coming quarters. Moreover, the Committee sees some risk that inflation could persist for a time below rates that best foster economic growth and price stability in the longer term. "The Federal Reserve will employ all available tools to promote the resumption of sustainable economic growth and to preserve price stability. The focus of the Committee's policy is to support the functioning of financial markets and stimulate the economy through open market operations and other measures that are likely to keep the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet at a high level. The Federal Reserve continues to purchase large quantities of agency debt and mortgage-backed securities to provide support to the mortgage and housing markets, and it stands ready to expand the quantity of such purchases and the duration of the purchase program as conditions warrant. "The Committee also is prepared to purchase longer-term Treasury securities if evolving circumstances indicate that such transactions would be particularly effective in improving conditions in private credit markets. The Federal Reserve will be implementing the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility to facilitate the extension of credit to households and small businesses. The Committee will continue to monitor carefully the size and composition of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet in light of evolving financial market developments and to assess whether expansions of or modifications to lending facilities would serve to further support credit markets and economic activity and help to preserve price stability." RICHMOND FED PRESIDENT JEFFREY LACKER, JAN 16: "As long as you have some material risk that remains on a bank's books, any new equity investor is going to be subsidizing existing debt holders. That is going to pose an impediment to raising new equity and recapitalizing the banking system from the private sector." * SAN FRANCISCO FED PRESIDENT JANET YELLEN, JAN 15: "With respect to wealth, the combined impact of falling equity and house prices has been staggering ... it seems likely that inflation will move, for a time, below levels that are consistent with price stability." "Federal Reserve policy-makers would find it unacceptable to left inflation fall below 1 percent ... we need to make it clear that would be undesirable, unwelcome and we would fight it." * CHICAGO FED PRESIDENT CHARLES EVANS, JAN 15: "Having an explicit numerical objective for inflation could help inflation expectations from falling very far." "It could be useful to purchase significant quantities of longer-term securities such as agency debt, agency mortgage-based securities and Treasury securities." * ATLANTA FED PRESIDENT DENNIS LOCKHART, JAN 15: "Banks remain under stress, so it would be hard to predict that there will be no more failures." "The capital injections have helped ... If the second $350 billion tranche of the TARP (Troubled Asset Relief Program) in fact is deployed, in all likelihood, some of that will be deployed to inject further capital into banks." MINNEAPOLIS FED PRESIDENT GARY STERN, JAN 14: "In view of the state of the credit markets and of the housing sector, it seems a fair bet that it will take time for momentum to build. "Neither concern (deflation or inflation) can be dismissed out of hand, but if economic growth resumes in the United States as I expect, the threat of deflation should diminish commensurately." PHILADELPHIA FED PRESIDENT CHARLES PLOSSER, JAN 14: "Our aggressive lending, while intended to help the economy and financial crisis recover, poses its own set of challenges. We must develop a well-articulated exit strategy if we are to maintain control of monetary policy." * ATLANTA FED PRESIDENT DENNIS LOCKHART, JAN 12: "The Federal Reserve has not exhausted its policy tools. The policy arsenal available to the Fed remains a powerful corrective force on the economy. Even with the federal funds rate effectively at zero, there is ample scope to do more ... if conditions require." "A fed fund rate this low will have considerable macroeconomic effect, especially if accompanied by policies to improve the functioning of credit markets." (Reporting by  Ros Krasny )
