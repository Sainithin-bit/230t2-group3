 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve on Wednesday said it is prepared to buy long-term government debt if that would help improve conditions in financial markets. 

 KEY POINTS: * Fed says prepared to buy longer-term Treasuries if would improve credit market conditions * Focus of policy is to support financial markets through open-market operations, other measures * Fed keeps benchmark rate in zero to 0.25 pct range; says rates will stay low for some time COMMENTS: GARY THAYER, SENIOR ECONOMIST, WACHOVIA SECURITIES, ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI: "The Fed seems to be much closer to buying long-dated Treasuries than was the case last year. They would like to see mortgage rates come down further and if Treasury rates move up, that makes it difficult for mortgage rates to come down further. They are hoping to get Treasury rates to come down again by saying that they are prepared to buy long-dated Treasuries; but they may actually have to do it. They need to back up words with action. Their statement said that they are prepared to buy longer-term Treasury securities if such transactions would be particularly effective in improving conditions in private credit markets. Treasuries sold off after the statement because the market may have been looking for more concrete confirmation that the Fed would buy Treasuries." JIM PAULSEN, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, WELLS CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, MINNEAPOLIS: "By and large, I don't see a lot in there that wasn't known prior to report. "We realized the Fed was moving toward using the long markets as their new Fed funds policy tool. "Think we've been there already. Without them actually buying it, the bond market's already adjust to the fact. "The combination of some good earnings reports from the banks and, more important than anything, some clarity on where we're heading with banking policy in the near-term is what's contributing mainly to the (stock) rally. "The whole idea of going out and purchasing 10-year treasuries ultimately is to get long term financing costs down for the private economy. "The problem with that announcement is that these bond yields have already come down 2 percent from 4 to 2 long before the Fed comes out and says they're going to do it." BILL O'NEILL, MANAGING PARTNER OF LOGIC ADVISORS, UPPER SADDLE RIVER, NEW JERSEY: "It indicates that that the overall atmosphere is still very troubled and there is a long way for recovery. It does not bode well for base metals, and it confirms the view that copper will continue to suffer from demand constraint." "For gold, it shows that the credit crisis is still very severe, and it will keep gold in people's eyes. Certainly, the (FOMC) statement will not discourage the flight-to-safety type of buying in gold." ROB STEIN, MANAGING PARTNER, ASTOR ASSET MANAGEMENT, CHICAGO: "Nothing unexpected in the report. I'm a little surprised that they put a slight concern about inflation in there. It looks like the dollar is reacting to that a little bit. "By and large, the 'bad bank' news from last night is much bigger news. They're still going to buy Treasuries -- not surprising -- they're going to try and keep rates down. "It was really very benign, unlike the unprecedented move that happened at the last meeting. The market is receiving it fairly well, and it's exactly what I was expecting. The meeting was very boring." JOSEPH BATTIPAGLIA, MARKET STRATEGIST, STIFEL NICOLAUS, YARDLEY, PENNSYLVANIA: "The language about the economy is consistent with what they said before, and they tried to nuance the question of whether or not you're going to have deflation in the economy... "It as a supportive statement as you could expect from the Federal Reserve, consistent with what we know. "We have had a number of rallies for the past year and a half that were based upon the expectation that some macro impact was going to change the course of the economy and correct the excesses of the financial system. And each one of those were dashed. "You have a Federal Reserve that can't do any more in an attempt to reinflate the American economy. I've never seen this kind of behavior by a Federal Reserve because they're showing no restraint whatsoever. And even with all that, you're getting a few 100 points back up off the more recent lows. I say you're still in a bear market and these rallies are nice, and the financials, I think you can sell into this now. ERIC KUBY, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, NORTH STAR INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT CORP, CHICAGO: "There was a time not too long ago where the Fed statements were the defining moment. Now we're looking for what the plan is for the banks. How are we going to solve this banking crisis and get this stimulus package passed? The Fed policy is sort of flipping into third place between those key issues and corporate earnings." "I don't think there are any big shockers from the Fed statement. What moved the market earlier in the day is the bad bank concept gaining more acceptance." ASHA BANGALORE, ECONOMIST, NORTHERN TRUST, CHICAGO "There's not much of a difference from the earlier policy statement." "The only part that is bullish for the economy is that they very clearly said they want to buy Treasuries. It's a positive for investors because it will bring down Treasury yields further, which is a positive for economic growth. It is favorable for improving credit market conditions." ANDREW BRENNER, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT, MF GLOBAL, NEW YORK: "Ask yourself this question, if the Fed was really ready to buy U.S. Treasury securities then why would Lacker dissent? They are not currently going to buy them. Expect weakness in the long end (of Treasuries) and curve to steepen." CARY LEAHEY, ECONOMIST, DECISION ECONOMICS, NEW YORK: "The Fed reiterated that they would use all available tools and all the things they've been doing to expand their balance sheet and that they might buy long-dated Treasuries. The Fed said it was 'prepared' to purchase long-dated Treasuries while at the end of the last policy meeting, it said it was just 'evaluating' the possibility of buying long-dated Treasuries. So they may be closer to purchasing Treasuries. "With short-term rates already at zero, most of the market interest right now is about what's going to happen about the Troubled Asset Relief Program and even though the Fed will have an extremely important role to play in expanding the TARP, they still will take -- at least publicly -- a back seat to the Treasury when those changes finally are rolled out, perhaps as early as next week." KEVIN FLANAGAN, FIXED INCOME STRATEGIST FOR GLOBAL WEALTH MANAGEMENT WITH MORGAN STANLEY, PURCHASE, NEW YORK: "Perhaps the government bond market was looking for an indication the Fed would suggest these Treasury purchases would be coming sooner rather than later." JOE KINAHAN, CHIEF DERIVATIVES STRATEGIST, THINKORSWIM GROUP, CHICAGO: "The Fed did what the market wanted to hear. It said they are on a path of credit easing for the overall economy and would buy U.S. Treasuries when and if needed. They said the economy is still weak but showed optimism for the second half of the year. The Fed would pump money into the economy to ease credit where needed. As a result, S&P levels held steady which is a great sign coming off three consecutive days of gains." KURT KARL, HEAD OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH AND CONSULTING, SWISS RE, NEW YORK: "This should be bullish for everybody. They are ready to expand the quantity of purchases in the agency and mortgage markets. There was a concern about the limits coming to an end soon. They mention again the longer-term Treasuries, which is again a positive note and there should be a little rally at that end. "They are coming up with the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility, to be rolled out and that is for households and small businesses. They will watch the balance sheet which is getting enormous but they don't say that they will curtail it or anything. So this is definitely a positive statement. "Basically they are opening their wallets and are ready to start buying more assets and extend that if necessary. The big issue now is restoring confidence in the economy, the banking sector and the ability to have a floor on these asset prices and this statement is important in that regard and of course the Fed is very important for restoring confidence." TOM SOWANICK, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, CLEARBROOK FINANCIAL LLC, PRINCETON, NEW JERSEY: "The Federal Reserve is committed to accepting forward inflation in exchange for stability of the credit markets -- which is why we are experiencing rising long-term interest rates and equities jumping higher. The Fed is signaling that if nothing else works after they've purchased large quantities of agency debt and MBS, then they will buy Treasuries." GREG SALVAGGIO, VICE PRESIDENT OF TRADING, TEMPUS CONSULTING, WASHINGTON: "It's in line with what everyone was thinking. They've said they are now prepared to buy Treasuries as well, which they'd hinted earlier. Their aim is to keep short end of the curve compressed and boost efforts to get mortgage rates lower. This is good news for the dollar and we think it will keep consolidating against the euro and move toward $1.30." SACHA TIHANYI, CURRENCY STRATEGIST, SCOTIA CAPITAL, TORONTO: "The Fed kept rates on hold as expected of course, and also stated that they stand prepared to purchase Treasuries if deemed effective. Additionally they still view the economy as weakening further. It looks like we are getting a tiny bit of dollar buying. They did not mention instituting any kind of inflation targeting regime." MARKET REACTION: STOCKS: U.S. equity indexes initially add to gains. BONDS: U.S. Treasury debt prices erase gains and fall. DOLLAR: U.S. dollar trims losses versus the euro.
