 DAVOS, Switzerland  (Reuters) - Barclays' president and investment banking head Bob Diamond has dropped plans to attend this week's World Economic Forum, the latest banker to stay behind while market turmoil continues. 

 "Bob is no longer able to attend Davos," Barclays said in an email to Reuters. A spokesman in London declined to comment on the reason, but said Chairman Marcus Agius and other officials from the bank would still attend. Many bankers, in particular U.S. ones, are avoiding the glitz of the Davos slopes this year. Those who have dropped out at the last moment include Citigroup Chief Executive Vikram Pandit and former Merrill Lunch chief John Thain. Barclays, whose shares had been under pressure in recent weeks, said on Monday it was not seeking capital from investors or the state as it remained profitable despite writedowns, and brought forward the release of its full-year results to February 9. It projected pre-tax profit of more than 5 billion pounds, boosting shares by 73 percent on Monday. For full coverage, blogs and TV from Davos go to  www.reuters.com/davos (Writing by  Lisa Jucca )
