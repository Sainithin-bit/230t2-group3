 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner will see his salary cut by more than half this year, according to his federal financial disclosure form released on Wednesday. 

 His assets, valued between $740,000 and $1.7 million, are dwarfed by those of his predecessor, Henry Paulson, the former Goldman Sachs boss who was estimated to be worth $700 million when he took the Treasury job in 2006. Geithner, whose nomination stirred controversy in recent weeks when it was disclosed that he underpaid self-employment taxes by about $34,000 earlier this decade, earned an annual salary of $411,200 as president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank. According to the Treasury's website, his salary at the Treasury will drop to $191,300. However, he has received a severance payment of $434,666 from the Fed and will be able to transfer $63,111 in Fed pension benefits. Geithner was confirmed on Monday by a 60-34 Senate vote, as lawmakers largely overlooked his tax problems in light of his experience battling the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. Geithner's largest asset is partial ownership of a Cape Cod vacation property in Massachusetts, valued between $250,001 and $500,000. Most of his other assets are mutual fund holdings valued between $15,001 and $100,000. The disclosure forms value assets in broad ranges. Geithner, who has spent his entire career working for governmental agencies and the International Monetary Fund, said in a letter to Treasury lawyers that he agreed to divest a number of these holdings before he took the job. These divestments were worth between $211,000 and $515,000 on the form, which is dated January 12. They include holdings in the Transamerica PIMCO Total Return Fund, the Vanguard Short-Term Federal Fund, several college savings plans and other U.S. government securities funds. As Treasury Secretary, he has direct influence over the issuance and markets for Treasury securities and on tax advantages for investments such as college savings accounts. Paulson was forced to sell some 3.2 million shares of Goldman stock before he took office in July 2006. At that time, they were worth about $480 million and the proceeds were deposited into a blind trust. (Reporting by David Lawder; Editing by Tom Hals)
