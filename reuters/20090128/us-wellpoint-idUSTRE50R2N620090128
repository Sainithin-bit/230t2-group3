 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - WellPoint Inc ( WLP.N ) said Wednesday that fourth-quarter profit dropped 61 percent, dragged down by investment losses, but the health insurer gave positive signals about medical costs moderating and predicted at least some profit growth this year. 

 Shares rose over 6 percent, as health-insurer stocks were also helped by a big rally for financials on optimism over aid to the banking sector. WellPoint reported an increase in medical costs at the low end of its 2008 forecast, indicating that medical costs are moderating and could lead to profit margin expansion, Sanford Bernstein analyst Ana Gupte said. "The recession is moderating utilization," Gupte said. "People are expecting that to be a big tailwind for this whole space into '09." For the quarter, WellPoint's net income declined to $331.4 million, or 65 cents per share, from $859.1 million, or $1.51 per share, a year earlier. The latest quarter included net realized investment losses of $350.5 million after taxes, or 69 cents per share. WellPoint warned investors of the big hit from investments earlier this month. Revenue rose 0.7 percent to $15.43 billion. WellPoint, the largest U.S. health insurer by membership, is grappling with rising unemployment caused by the weak economy, which hurt its enrollment in the quarter. It forecast low-single-digit earnings per share growth for 2009, although it withheld providing its detailed outlook until its investor meeting next month. "There's a lot of uncertainty about '09 ... but it was positive in that we're going to see some decent growth," said Tim Nelson, a healthcare analyst with First American Funds. "It's hard to find positive these days." Shares of rivals also rose, with Cigna Corp ( CI.N ) up 11.5 percent and Aetna Inc ( AET.N ) 6.5 percent higher. Health insurers, which have large balance sheets, have seen their stock fortunes rise and fall in part with the broader financial sector during the past several months. "This group is acting better as the financial sector acts better," said David Heupel, a portfolio manager with Thrivent Investment Management. ROCKY MARKETS HURT INSURERS The rocky markets have hurt many U.S. health insurers, which have larger portfolios of investments than most other companies because they hold extensive reserves to meet statutory requirements. Excluding items, earnings of $1.34 per share were 2 cents below the average forecast of analysts, according to Reuters Estimates. However, several analysts said results were slightly ahead of their estimates after excluding restructuring charges tied to 1,500 job cuts that the company revealed earlier this month. "The quarter was largely as expected," Goldman Sachs analyst Matthew Borsch said in a research note. Year-end enrollment of 35 million fell short of the roughly 35.2 million WellPoint expected in October. Enrollment fell by 288,000 people during the fourth quarter as employers across industries cut jobs, the company said. WellPoint's benefit expense ratio -- which measures the percentage of premiums spent on medical costs -- worsened to 83.4 percent from 82.9 percent a year earlier. Analysts at Oppenheimer had expected 83.3 percent. Shares rose $2.71 or 6.4 percent to $45.33 in late morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange. After a rough 2008 for HMO stocks, WellPoint shares were up about 1 percent this year at Tuesday's close, less than a 6 percent rise for the S&P Managed Health Care index .GSPHMO. Earlier this month, WellPoint shares slumped after the U.S. government ordered the insurer to stop marketing and enrollment for its Medicare plans because of violations of federal regulations.
