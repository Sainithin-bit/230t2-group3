 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The Obama administration is increasingly focused on the possible creation of a "bad bank" that would let U.S. financial institutions move toxic assets off their books, an idea that cheered Wall Street and helped push financial shares higher on Wednesday. 

 Sheila Bair, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp, has floated the idea that her agency should manage such a bad bank, two industry sources told Reuters. Bair contends the FDIC is best positioned to run such a government entity because it has years of experience disposing of the least-valuable assets of failed American banks, according to one of the industry sources who has direct knowledge of Bair's thinking. An FDIC spokesman declined to comment directly. The agency continues to provide its "best thinking on potential policy decisions" to the White House and Treasury Department, the FDIC spokesman said. "Sheila Bair seems to be offering her agency as a logical manager of this plan because it is the FDIC's traditional role and it is their expertise," said John Dearie, senior vice president at the Financial Services Forum who previously held various roles at the New York Federal Reserve. Financial stocks traded higher on optimism that President Barack Obama and his administration will swiftly act to stabilize the ailing banking sector. The Standard & Poor's index of financial stocks was up 10 percent on Wednesday afternoon. "Any sort of credible plan for dealing in a definitive way with these toxic assets is music to the ears of equity investors," Dearie said. Laura Tyson, who was an economic adviser to President Barack Obama's election campaign, further fueled speculation on Wednesday that the creation of a bad bank is near. Tyson said that repairing financial markets and revitalizing lending will require governments to remove bad assets from banks and recapitalize them. "The natural next step is, which is real simple, you take the bad assets out, the balance sheets are hit really hard, you recapitalize banks with different rules, and they go out again and lend," Tyson said in a panel discussion at the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. IN THE WORKS For weeks top U.S. policymakers have been discussing the idea of a bad bank, also known as an aggregator bank. The Obama administration had hoped to reveal a comprehensive plan by the end of this week to stabilize the financial system, according to industry sources. The timeline is still fluid, they said. Nonperforming loans on U.S. banks' balance sheets are seen as a key reason why banks are reluctant to resume lending. The lack of credit has contributed to a year-long recession sparked by the collapse of the housing market. A series of government efforts to clean up the mess have fallen short, as evidenced by banks such as Citigroup and Bank of America coming back to the government for more money, in return for partial public ownership. Goldman Sachs economist Jan Hatzius has estimated total credit losses may exceed $2 trillion globally, and banks have so far recognized less than half that much. Earlier this month, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and the central bank's No. 2 official, Donald Kohn, both said a bad bank was among the options to be considered. Bair has said the government could use the second half of the $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) fund to capitalize an "aggregator bank." The government could also require banks raise some private equity if they want to sell bad assets to the aggregator bank, Bair has said. Valuation of toxic assets remains a fundamental question in how the U.S. government would create and run a bad bank. Douglas Elmendorf, the new head of the Congressional Budget Office, said on Wednesday that a bad bank plan would be fraught with challenges as policymakers try to pay the right price. "Pricing should give financial institutions an incentive to solve their problems on their own if they are in a position to do so and should mean shuttering institutions that have little prospect of recovery," he told the Senate Budget Committee. U.S. lawmakers have yet to see details of how a bad bank option would be carried out, indicating the White House is still formulating its plan. And Dearie said the valuation issue is just one outstanding question. Others include how the bad bank would be financed, who would run the government facility, and what would be the ripple effect on the banking industry. "Of course the devil is in the details," Dearie said. (Reporting by Karey Wutkowski,  Rachelle Younglai ,  Stella Dawson , John Poirier, and Patrick Rucker; Editing by Steve Orlofsky and  Tim Dobbyn )
