 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. drugmaker Wyeth WYE.N said on Wednesday it was maintaining its profit forecast for 2007, but added that first-quarter earnings would exceed current Wall Street average estimates of 85 cents per share. 


 The company reaffirmed its full-year earnings forecast of $3.40 to $3.50 per share, excluding items such as potential restructuring charges. That represents an increase of 8 percent to 11 percent over 2006. Wyeth also said that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's re-inspection of a manufacturing plant in Puerto Rico, which began in late January, is expected to take at least several more weeks to complete. The company received an FDA warning letter last May regarding concerns about the plant in Guayama, Puerto Rico.
