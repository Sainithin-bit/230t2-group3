 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Sales of new U.S. homes fell 16.6 percent in January and prices were little changed as the number of new homes on the market decreased slightly, according to a government report on Wednesday showing some weakness in the unsteady housing sector. 


 New single-family home sales fell to an annualized rate of 937,000 units from an upwardly revised rate of 1.123 million units in December, the Commerce Department said. Analysts polled by Reuters were expecting January sales to dip to 1.080 million from the previously reported rate of 1.120 million units in December.   KEY POINTS: - The monthly decline in new home sales was the sharpest in 13 years, since a 23.8 percent drop-off in January 1994. - The National Association of Purchasing Management-Chicago said its business barometer slid to 47.9 from 48.8 in January. Economists surveyed by Reuters had forecast the index would come in at 50.0. The 64 estimates ranged from 47.5 to 52.0.   COMMENTARY:  PIERRE ELLIS, SENIOR ECONOMIST, DECISION ECONOMICS, NEW YORK: "The whole picture presented by the January new home sales drop is that housing is unexpectedly soft. Sales fell more than expected and that effectively offsets the drop in housing starts so that the inventory of unsold homes was virtually unchanged. If sales declines are offsetting production declines, that means that inventories cannot be brought under control. That will keep downward pressure on new home prices and new home prices are probably very poorly measured by this report because there are many unseen discounts going on. The housing market rebalancing is not proceeding as directly as would be best for the economy and downside risks remain."  SHAUN OSBORNE, CHIEF CURRENCY STRATEGIST, TD SECURITIES,  TORONTO: "Fundamentals are not looking too brilliant for the U.S. dollar at this point. Interestingly though, despite the bad news, the dollar has not lost that much ground. Obviously, we've got a big fundamental shift in the market -- a big drop in the dollar on Tuesday and a narrowing in the 2-year interest rate spreads with the euro. The problem at this point is that we've got significant short dollar base already."  JOHN MCCARTHY, DIRECTOR OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE, ING CAPITAL  MARKETS, NEW YORK: "Given the housing data, the equity market performance and durable goods yesterday, I'd have thought the euro would be higher. My gut tells me that the market is still long a lot of euros, because we've had a lot of bad U.S. data but the euro can't get much above 1.3250. All the dollar bearish news has produced one thing, and that's a stronger yen, as people will liquidate carry trades to offset losses elsewhere, particularly in equities. Essentially, we are still looking at the equity market."  MARK MEADOWS, CURRENCY STRATEGIST, TEMPUS CONSULTING,  WASHINGTON, D.C.: "The dollar is somewhat supported today after yesterday's big move. But the truth is that weakening in the currency will probably continue. Good data is clearly becoming more sparse and today's reports, if anything, just reinforce the view the Fed is done tightening."  MARKET REACTION: - U.S. Treasury debt prices pare losses after weaker-than-expected Jan U.S. new home sales. - The dollar pared gains, pushing the euro to $1.3215 after the U.S. data from $1.3205  EUR= . Against the yen, the dollar was still up at 118.13 yen  JPY= .
