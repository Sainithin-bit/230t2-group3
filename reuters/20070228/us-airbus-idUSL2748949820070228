 TOULOUSE, France  (Reuters) - Troubled planemaker Airbus confirmed 10,000 job cuts and announced plans to sell all or part of six factories on Wednesday, as workers protested and European politicians hailed a hard-fought compromise. 


 Airbus Chief Executive Louis Gallois gave a stark vision of a Franco-German company needing to find billions of euros in savings and end nationalist infighting he deemed "poison". "We need to be interested in the future of Airbus and for that we need to be one integrated company," he said of a firm whose push for reforms dominated a recent Franco-German summit. Gallois told reporters Airbus will cut 5,000 staff and 5,000 workers contracted from other firms over the next four years. Some 4,300 jobs in France, 3,700 in Germany, 1,600 in Britain and 400 in Spain are expected to go. Shedding 5,000 of its staff would cut the Airbus workforce of 55,000 by 9 percent. This does not include some 3,000 staff at sites due to be sold at St. Nazaire in France and Varel and Laupheim in Germany. There were protests at Airbus factories in France at Meaulte and St. Nazaire and unions warned of wider walkouts. Several hundred assembly workers also downed tools at the Toulouse headquarters. German Airbus workers expressed a mixture of disbelief and fear as they left the Varel plant, where they walked off the job along with workers at Laupheim. "Before Friday, nothing is going to happen here," said Michael Eilers, head of the workers' council at Airbus in Nordenham, announcing a spontaneous walk-out at the factory. Shares in parent firm EADS closed up 1.8 percent as investors welcomed the plans to cut 2.1 billion euros in annual operating cost from 2010 and a further 5 billion cash. Gallois said Meaulte as well as Filton in England and Nordenham in Germany were sites where Airbus will look for investors to take partial stakes, although GKN Plc, mooted as a possible investor in Filton, declined to comment. GOVERNMENTS REACT The shake-up comes after a two-year delay in delivering the A380 superjumbo put a 5-billion-euro ($6.61 billion) hole in expected earnings at EADS. It also needs to speed up work on the A350, which is already lagging rival Boeing's development of its 787 model by five years. Power8, as the restructuring is known, was first mooted in October and sparked a split between France and Germany over the distribution of job losses, and the placement of future ones. The restructuring had "ensured a balanced distribution of risks and opportunities," German Chancellor Angela Merkel told journalists in Berlin, adding she regretted that workers in Germany, France and Spain would lose their jobs. British Prime Minister Tony Blair hailed a victory for the Filton plant, one of two in Britain, citing coveted carbon fiber composites work for the wing of the A350. Gallois said the Toulouse headquarters would assemble the A350 in return for letting the plant in Hamburg, Germany, assemble the successor to the smaller A320 airliner. Hamburg will also get more work on the current A320 series. But the most crucial part of a deal which unblocked negotiations in the past week concerned Germany's share of the workload on larger, higher-margin and wide-bodied aircraft. Talks broke down 10 days ago when German co-Chairman Manfred Bischoff and co-CEO Tom Enders refused to back the overall restructuring package without a "clear role" for Germany in high technology, a source familiar with the talks told Reuters. That piece of the puzzle fell into place on Monday when they lifted their veto in return for broad management control of fuselages and highly customized cabins. Not only did the delay allow board tempers to cool it also made room for French and German leaders to bless the accord and, importantly for Airbus, invest some political capital in it at a time when job cuts threaten a storm in France and Germany. With French elections in April and May, Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin had urged the company to avoid forced sackings. Socialist candidate Segolene Royal pledged to call for a freeze on job cuts if she is elected, while her center-right rival Nicolas Sakozy said the state should stand aside.
