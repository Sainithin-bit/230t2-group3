 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. banking regulators plan to issue guidance on the subprime mortgage market as early as Thursday afternoon, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters on Wednesday. 


 The guidance will be issued by agencies including the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. The guidance is likely to allow the public to comment for at least 60 days on controversial mortgages provided to consumers with poor credit histories, the sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
