 (Reuters) - European planemaker Airbus announced cost cuts and job reductions on Wednesday. Following is a summary of highlights from a statement released by Airbus and its parent 


  EADS: * The plan will make Airbus better prepared to face the challenge of U.S. Dollar weakness, increased competitive pressure, the financial burden related to the A380 delays as well as to meet its other future investment needs. * The transformation will happen over several years. * The Airbus management will implement strong cost reduction and cash generating efforts leading to EBIT contributions of 2.1 billion euros from 2010 onwards and additional 5 billion of cumulative cash flow from 2007 to 2010. * The measures to reduce overhead cost, and specifically headcount, require a provision of 680 million euros to be taken in the first quarter of 2007. * To ensure full and sustainable implementation of Power8, Airbus has put in place a robust tracking system with tangible metrics regarding cost, and cash impact up to their materialization in the financial statements. * "The core objective of Power8 is to make Airbus more efficient and competitive, so as to produce the most advanced and profitable products, and to serve its customers better in the future", said EADS CEOs Tom Enders and Louis Gallois. * "Without establishing Power8 quickly, profitability will drift significantly short of industry standards and of reasonable expectations. This is an unsustainable and unacceptable situation. Power8 is designed to reduce that gap," said EADS and Airbus CFO Hans Peter Ring. * The objective of a lighter and cost efficient management will be addressed by several Power8 program modules and in particular by the reduction of overhead cost. * The Airbus management proposes a progressive headcount reduction of 10,000 ... positions over four years, thereof 3,200 in France, 3,700 in Germany, 400 in Spain, 1,600 in the UK and 1,100 in the Airbus Central Entity in Toulouse. 5,000 of these positions are temporary or on-site subcontractors, where reductions will begin immediately. * The other 5,000 positions affected will be Airbus employees. Priority is given to achieve reductions through attrition, the negotiated voluntary severance processes and schemes in each country concerned. * At this stage, Airbus management does not propose forced redundancies. * A number of measures are being implemented to further increase the efficiency of the Final Assembly Lines (FAL). Toulouse will see a further capacity enhancement of the long-range Final Assembly Line (FAL) as the A350XWB will be assembled and receive its interior furnishing in Toulouse. * In Hamburg, a third A320 Family FAL will be set up immediately. It will have full type flexibility, so as to also cope with the demand for additional A320s when the demand for A320s exceeds the rate of 14 per month. * Hamburg will also perform final assembly of the New Single Aisle Family. Furthermore, in order to allow parts to be fitted in the most logical place to optimize the overall cycle time, some upstream preparatory cabin installation work for the A380 and the A320 assembled in Toulouse will be transferred from Hamburg to Toulouse. * Nevertheless, cabin installation remains in Hamburg and A380 deliveries will be performed both from Hamburg and Toulouse. * On the engineering and manufacturing side, Airbus will Focus on Core Business activities which are critical for the integrity and safety of the aircraft or vital for technological and commercial differentiation. * Airbus is considering industrial partnerships at its plants in Filton, Meaulte and Nordenham, in order to facilitate their development from metallic to composite design and manufacturing technology. * The company has already received unsolicited proposals by potential industrial partners ready to invest in these sites. * The sites in Laupheim, St. Nazaire-Ville and Varel will continue to perform long-term substantial workloads on the current Airbus aircraft programs, such as the A380, the A320, the A330/A340 Families, and theA400M. * Airbus is committed to seeking viable opportunities for these sites in the years to come. This includes the options to sell these sites to key suppliers, management buy-outs or the gathering with sites nearby. * The A350XWB will be the first program benefiting strongly from the very beginning from the Power8 initiative. * Airbus will assign large work packages to Tier 1 suppliers in return for a better distribution of future investment, risks and opportunities. * Fifty percent of aerostructure work will be outsourced to risksharing partners ( 1.8 billion euros non-recurring cost and 600 million euros associated capital expenditures). * This is about twice as much as in earlier programs. Further Power8 modules are designed to streamline Airbus' processes and support the Company's transition * Airbus will replace the current organization of eight nationally structured centers of excellence by four transnational centers of excellence: Fuselage & Cabin (based in Germany), Wing (based in the UK), Rear End (based in Spain), and Aerostructures (based in France), the latter being in charge of fuselage subassembly and interior furnishing activities.
