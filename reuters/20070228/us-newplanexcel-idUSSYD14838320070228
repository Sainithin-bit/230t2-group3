 SYDNEY/NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Australia's Centro Properties Group CNP.AX has agreed to buy New Plan Excel Realty Trust NXL.N for about $3.4 billion in cash, accelerating the group's push into the United States. 


 This marks Centro Properties' third U.S. purchase and it said in a statement that directors of New Plan had unanimously recommended the offer. Last year, Centro concluded the purchases of Kramont and Heritage real estate investment trusts. The latest acquisition would also make Centro Watt -- Centro's U.S. property management joint venture -- the third-biggest U.S. shopping centers owner, behind Developers Diversified Realty Group and Kimco Realty Corp, according to Centro. The deal values New Plan at $33.15 per share, a 13 percent premium over its Tuesday closing price of $29.34 on the New York Stock Exchange. New Plan valued the transaction at $6.2 billion including assumed debt and preferred stock. ING Investment Management's property and infrastructure director Justin Blaess said the acquisition would propel Centro's share price higher and should silence critics of the group's complex capital structure. "With this the management team continues to deliver," he said. Centro Properties is making the acquisition with its subsidiary Centro Retail Trust ( CER.AX ) and shares in both companies were placed on a trading halt. Earlier on Wednesday, source familiar with the matter had told Reuters that Centro Retail Trust was planning to raise A$1 billion ($794 million) through a share sale and non-renounceable entitlement issue to part-fund the acquisition. Centro Properties will undertake an institutional placement of A$250 million to help complete the acquisition. JP Morgan is the underwriter to the share sale. The acquisition, which the company said would provide a 10 percent uplift for earnings, should underpin a substantial rise in the share price once the stock reopened, Blaess said. "The stock has had a pretty good run but we would expect to see further gains after this. "If you're a long-term holder you'll easily get another 10 percent," he said. Centro Properties, which has a market value of A$8.1 billion, has about A$15.6 billion funds under management. New Plan expects the transaction to close in the second quarter, subject to customary closing conditions. The company's portfolio includes 467 properties, including 453 shopping centers in 38 U.S. states and 14 other real estate assets. The $3.4 billion value is based on New Plan's reported shares outstanding as of February 21. "The quality portfolio of U.S. convenience shopping centers fulfils Centro's desire to access appropriate assets for its Australian co-investors," Centro Properties Chief Executive Andrew Scott said in a statement. Meanwhile, Galileo Shopping Group GSA.AX -- which counts New Plan Excel as its joint venture partner -- said Centro's proposed acquisition would trigger certain rights under the joint venture management agreements with New Plan. Galileo said it was seeking advice on what rights were triggered and was considering what course of action to take. (Additional reporting by Jane Williams)
