 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Sprint Nextel Corp ( S.N ) on Wednesday posted a higher fourth-quarter profit as revenue rose despite weak customer growth. 


 Earnings rose to $261 million, or 9 cents per share, from $195 million, or 7 cents per share, a year earlier. Net operating revenue rose to $10.44 billion from $9.79 billion. Analysts on average expected revenue of $10.36 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. Sprint shares have fallen about 25 percent in the last year as the company has reported disappointing customer growth and lost market share to rivals as it struggles to integrate its August 2005 acquisition of Nextel Communications.
