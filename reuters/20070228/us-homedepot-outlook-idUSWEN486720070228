 ATLANTA  (Reuters) - Home Depot Inc. ( HD.N ) said on Wednesday it expects per-share profit to fall and sales growth to slow this year as the U.S. housing slump hurts business and as it boosts spending on older stores in a bid to win back market share. 


 The world's largest home improvement chain said at its analyst meeting in Atlanta that earnings per share would decline 4 percent to 9 percent this year. Total sales may rise up to 2 percent in 2007. Sales at stores open at least a year, an important retail measure known as same-store sales, are expected to fall in the mid-single-digit percentage range. "We've got to invest more to get back share," Chairman and Chief Executive Frank Blake told a media briefing after the meeting. He said the retailer had lost market share in categories including flooring and bath. Analysts on average expected Home Depot to post a per-share profit of $2.78 for 2007, which would represent a decline of about 3 percent from $2.86 a year earlier, according to Reuters Estimates. Total sales are expected to rise 3 percent to $93.8 billion. The outlook "should reassure investors that management is willing to sacrifice near-term earnings for strategic reinvestment," Sanford Bernstein analyst Colin McGranahan said in a research note. Home Depot, under pressure as rival Lowe's Cos. ( LOW.N ) expands to bigger U.S. cities and Canada, plans to increase capital spending 29 percent to $4.5 billion to recruit skilled trade workers, maintain stores and lure professional customers. It plans to open 115 new stores over the next year. Much of the funds will be spent on enhancing the shopping experience with store maintenance, more staff and customer loyalty programs, Home Depot said. ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT Home Depot's "perception in the public's eye in terms of customer service has suffered over the past five years, so there is a need to improve in that area," said Peter Jankovskis, director of research with Oakbrook Investments in Lisle, Illinois, which holds Home Depot and Lowe's stock. "In many ways, Home Depot is trying to talk down expectations," Jankovskis added. Blake, named CEO in January after Robert Nardelli resigned amid an uproar over his compensation, said the retailer doesn't expect the U.S. housing market to improve until late in the second half of this year or 2008. Home Depot posted its first-ever yearly drop in net earnings for 2006 as declining home sales and construction hurt demand. "2007 will also be a difficult year, but it will be a year of focus, simplification and investment and hopefully less noise," Blake said. Longer term, Home Depot expects yearly sales growth of 5 percent, earnings growth of better than 5 percent, and per-share profit growth of 10 percent or more as its retail business matures. "The market is not expecting from us double-digit sales growth," Blake said. The supply unit, which provides building materials and other products to contractors, is expected to grow to about 15 percent of total sales in 2007 from 13 percent currently. Home Depot is considering selling the unit. The new CEO said Home Depot was closing its two floor stores and is evaluating other store concepts to determine whether to keep them going, including the Landscape Supply stores, which sell plants and fuel centers. Blake took the reins as Home Depot had come under pressure because of weakening profits and sales, a regulatory probe over its stock options practices, and criticism of its corporate governance policies. Nardelli, who spent six years at Home Depot, was assailed by shareholders for his compensation package and management style. He left with a severance package of $210 million. Last week, Lowe's said it expects same-store sales to show improvement this year, helped by easier comparisons. Lowe's executives "seem to be more optimistic than us just on the market," Home Depot's Blake said. "I hope they are right." Home Depot's shares eased 22 cents, or 0.6 percent, to close at $39.60 on the New York Stock Exchange, while Lowe's was off 71 cents, or 2.1 percent, at $32.55 on the NYSE. Home Depot's shares have fallen 1 percent this year, while Lowe's are up 5 percent.
