 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Washington Post Co. ( WPO.N ) said on Wednesday its fourth-quarter profit fell 7 percent, dragged down by charges and a profit decline at its newspaper division. 


 Fourth-quarter net income fell to $95.5 million, or $9.97 a share, compared with $102.4 million, or $10.65 a share, in the fourth quarter a year earlier. Revenue rose 10 percent to $1.04 billion.
