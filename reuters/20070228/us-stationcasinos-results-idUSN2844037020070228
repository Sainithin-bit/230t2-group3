 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Station Casinos Inc. ( STN.N ), which is in the process of a management-led buyout, said on Wednesday fourth-quarter profit fell as it took charges for a canceled residential project and some pre-opening costs for planned expansions. 


 Station, which operates casinos that cater to Las Vegas residents, said net income fell to $23.1 million, or 41 cents per share, from $41.7 million, or 61 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items and development expenses, Station reported an adjusted profit of 53 cents per share. On that basis, Wall Street expected 45 cents a share, on average, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue rose 26 percent to $359 million, just ahead of analysts' average forecast of $354 million. The company reported strong growth in its major Las Vegas operations, with revenue rising 29 percent to $320 million. But overall results were held back by a $2.5 million charge for canceling a residential project at its Red Rock resort in Las Vegas, $2.3 million in costs for developing new tribal gaming opportunities and $2 million in pre-opening costs related to various expansions. It also paid out $2.5 million in costs associated with the management-led buyout, the terms of which were settled on Monday. Under the $5.4 billion deal, Station is being taken private by an investor group called Fertitta Colony Partners, formed by Station Chief Executive Frank Fertitta, his brother and company Vice Chairman Lorenzo Fertitta, and a unit of private equity firm Colony Capital. The group said on Monday it would take over Station for $90 per share, or $5.4 billion in cash. It will also assume debt of about $3.4 billion. The group first offered to buy Station in December for $82 per share. The deal is expected to close in about six to nine months.
