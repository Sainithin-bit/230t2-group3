 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Power company Edison International ( EIX.N ) said on Wednesday its quarterly earnings rose, helped by higher revenue from its utility arm and higher income from its Edison Capital unit. 


 Edison -- parent of Southern California Edison, the second biggest utility in California -- said net income was $288 million, or 87 cents a share, compared with $272 million, or 83 cents a share, a year before. Excluding special items, core earnings were 65 cents per share. The company reiterated its 2007 earnings forecast of $3.05 per share to $3.45 per share.
