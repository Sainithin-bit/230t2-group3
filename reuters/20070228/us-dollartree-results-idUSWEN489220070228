 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Dollar Tree Stores Inc. ( DLTR.O ) reported higher quarterly profit on Wednesday, inching past Wall Street estimates, helped by strong demand for a variety of holiday items. 


 The discount retailer said fourth-quarter net income rose to $97.6 million, or 96 cents per share, from $86.5 million, or 81 cents per share, a year earlier. Analysts, on average, had expected earnings of 95 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. In-store promotions like "build-a-wreath" and "build-a-gift basket," a wider variety of frozen and refrigerated items, and gift cards helped boost sales in the holiday season, Chief Executive Bob Sasser said in a conference call. Quarterly sales grew more than 22 percent to $1.32 billion. The company said in January that quarterly sales had reached $1.31 billion. Dollar Tree, which operates more than 3,200 stores in the United States, said it expects earnings of 32 cents to 35 cents per share in the first quarter. For the full year, it expects to earn $1.96 to $2.10 a share on sales of $4.2 billion to $4.3 billion.
