 (Reuters) - World markets were jolted on Wednesday by a U.S. stock sell-off of more than 3 percent that ranks among the steepest one-day falls in Wall Street history. 


 Following is a timeline of some major one-day percentage drops on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE): * October 29, 1929: The Dow Jones Industrial Average, falls more than 11 percent on "Black Tuesday", with a record volume of 16 million shares traded. It does not surpass the 1929 average again until 1954. * October 19, 1987: The Dow Jones index drops 22.6 percent, falling 508 points to 1,738.74 on "Black Monday", the biggest one-day drop in stock market history. Volume surges to an unprecedented 604 million shares, reaching 608 million shares the next day. * October 27 1997: The Asian financial crash spurs a global selloff; the Dow Jones index slumps 7.2 percent, or 554 points, in its biggest single-day points drop. The NYSE's "circuit-breaker" is triggered for the first time to halt trading at 3:30 p.m. * April 14, 2000: The Dow drops 5.6 percent, or 617 points -- a new steepest point decline in a single day. * September 17, 2001: The Dow falls 6.9 percent when trading resumes after a four-day halt following the September 11 attacks. It slides 659.62 points, with a record volume of 2.37 billion shares traded. * February 27, 2007: The Dow index falls 3.3 percent, or 416 points, spooked by a collapse in Chinese stocks and weak U.S. manufacturing data. Investors pour money into less-risky bonds as the index experiences its worst points slide since the aftermath of the September 11, 2001 attacks.
