 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Applebee's International Inc. APPB.O said on Wednesday sales at its restaurants open at least 18 months fell 4 percent in February as harsh winter weather kept customers at home. 


 The casual dining chain said same-store sales fell 3.9 percent at franchised locations and dropped 4.3 percent at company-owned outlets.
