 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ( WMT.N ) said on Wednesday the New York Stock Exchange advised it that it is not violating exchange rules, after a union pension fund asked NYSE regulators to probe whether pay consultants for the retailer are too cozy with its managers. 


 The secretary-treasurer of the AFL-CIO trade union confederation made the request in a letter dated February 23 to NYSE Regulation Inc. Chief of Enforcement Susan Merrill, citing an NYSE rule that says compensation consultants should answer solely to corporate directors, not to management. The AFL-CIO said it believed that Wal-Mart's compensation, nominating and corporate governance committee "may not be solely responsible" for choosing compensation consultants and determining their fees and terms of their retention, possibly violating NYSE listing standards. The Wall Street Journal reported on the letter early on Wednesday. In the letter, the AFL-CIO asked NYSE Regulation to open a formal investigation to confirm that Wal-Mart complies with the exchange's listing standards. "The New York Stock Exchange has indicated that we are not in violation of its rules," Wal-Mart spokesman John Simley said. The NYSE declined to comment and the AFL-CIO said on Wednesday afternoon it had not yet heard back from the NYSE. GE, HOME DEPOT MADE CHANGES Wal-Mart said it had asked the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for permission to omit a shareholder proposal submitted by the AFL-CIO, which asks for disclosure on how the company uses compensation consultants, from the proxy for its upcoming annual meeting. The company said it intends to substantially implement that proposal. Dan Pedrotty, director of the AFL-CIO office of investment, said his group also contacted the SEC about its shareholder proposal, and has not heard yet whether Wal-Mart will have to include the proposal in the proxy. Pedrotty said the AFL-CIO filed similar proposals at other companies including General Electric Co. ( GE.N ) and Home Depot Inc. ( HD.N ). The group then withdrew its proposals at both companies after each said it would implement the disclosure about consultants that the AFL-CIO was seeking. Wal-Mart said its board is evaluating whether to hire an independent compensation consultant to advise it on executive compensation. Shares of Wal-Mart, a component of the Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI , were up 3 cents at $48.23 on the NYSE. (Additional reporting by  Karen Jacobs  in Atlanta)
