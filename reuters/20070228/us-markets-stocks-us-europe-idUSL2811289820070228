 LONDON  (Reuters) - Wall Street is set to open up on Wednesday, recovering from the previous day's frantic sell-off, after calming remarks from China as investors look ahead to U.S preliminary GDP figures to judge the health of the economy. 


 Tuesday's sell-off wiped out the year's gains on all three major U.S stock indexes, but the markets look set to strengthen as investors reassess the factors behind the move, "Futures are looking up, I guess the markets look like they are going to get back some of yesterday's losses after the Chinese made some calming remarks," said Ben Rogoff, senior fund manager at Polar Capital Partners Ltd. The Shanghai benchmark gained nearly 4 percent on Wednesday as Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao said the government would make a priority of guarding the safety and stability of the country's financial markets. The Shanghai Composite Index dived nearly 9 percent on Tuesday, triggering the fall in global stock markets. Rogoff added: "I don't want to say yesterday was a storm in a teacup, but it looked like a fairly exaggerated move." He suggested that technical factors may also have been at play. U.S stock futures indicated that all three major indexes would open stronger. At 1100 GMT S&P 500 futures, Dow Jones industrial average futures and Nasdaq futures were up between 0.8-1.0 percent. A flurry of macroeconomic indicators will also be in focus. Analysts are expecting that preliminary GDP figures for the fourth quarter, due for release at 1330 GMT, will be revised down to 2.4 pct annual growth from 3.5 in the first estimate. "The mood the market is in, GDP is going to obviously be a very big deal," Rogoff said, adding that he would be focusing on figures for core PCE. The Chicago Purchasing Managers Index for February will also be of note at 1445 GMT, with a Reuters forecast of 50.0 versus 48.8 in January. U.S new home sales for January, a gauge of consumer confidence, are due at 1500 GMT. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke will be testifying on long-term fiscal challenges and the economy before the House Budget Committee at 1500 GMT, and is expected to allay concerns about a slowdown in the economy. While attention will be turned to macroeconomic indicators, several companies are due to report fourth quarter earnings, including Barr Pharmaceuticals and Liz Claiborne. Retailer Home Depot said on Wednesday that it expected per-share profit to decline this year. The Dow Jones industrial average was down 3.29 percent to 12,216.24, while the S&P 500 fell 3.47 percent and the Nasdaq slid 3.86 percent.
