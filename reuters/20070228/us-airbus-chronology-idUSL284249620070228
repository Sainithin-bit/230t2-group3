 (Reuters) - France's CGT trade union said on Wednesday that European planemaker Airbus had confirmed the sale of three sites in Europe while another three would get outside partners. 


 Some 10,000 jobs across four European countries may go including many contractors, industry sources said, as Airbus looks to regain ground it is losing to surging U.S. archrival Boeing Co. Following is a chronology of key events since cost overruns on the A380 superjumbo emerged more than two years ago which have forced Airbus to face restructuring: Dec 2004 - Airbus parent company EADS announces that the A380 superjumbo project is running 1.45 billion euros over budget. Jan 18, 2005 - French President Jacques Chirac, German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and British Prime Minister Tony Blair are among the more than 5,000 guests invited to Toulouse for a ceremony to "reveal" the A380. April 27, 2005 - The A380 completes a maiden flight lasting nearly four hours. June 1, 2005 - Airbus delays initial deliveries of the A380 by up to six months. June 13, 2006 - Airbus announces a second six-month delay in A380 deliveries and says the setback is expected to hit operating profit at EADS from 2007 until 2010. July 2, 2006 - EADS co-Chief Executive Noel Forgeard and Gustav Humbert, the man who had replaced him as CEO of Airbus a year earlier, resign over the second A380 delay. Sept 4, 2006 - Charles Champion, the head of the A380 program, is replaced by Mario Heinen, former head of the profitable A320 series. Sept 21, 2006 - EADS acknowledges that further delay of the Airbus A380 is expected. It blames wiring installation problems which have already delayed the project by a year. Oct 3, 2006 - EADS delays A380 deliveries by an additional year, putting the program two years behind schedule, and says Airbus will not see an operating profit on the A380 until 2010. Oct 3, 2006 - EADS announces 'Power8' restructuring program aimed at annual costs savings of least 2 billion euros from 2010 onwards and around 5 billion euros in cash savings by 2010. Oct 9, 2006 - Airbus CEO Christian Streiff quits after 100 days on the job. Oct 19, 2006 - Airbus says A380 program breakeven point has risen to 420 aircraft from earlier estimate of 270. Some analysts note the new figure fails to take into account the impact of a weakened dollar since 2000, arguing the real figure could be higher. Nov 7, 2006 - FedEx Corp. cancels a $2.5 billion order for the A380 and switches to Boeing planes instead. Jan 17, 2007 - Airbus concedes the annual new plane orders crown to Boeing CO. for the first time since 2000, failing to retain its minimum target of 40 percent market share by value and losing to its U.S. rival in every model range. Feb 2, 2007 - Some 24,000 Airbus and supplier employees in Germany and 100 in France stage protests over feared job cuts. Feb 19, 2007 - Airbus cancels planned February 20 announcement of Power8 details. Company cites differences over where its newest model, the A350 XWB, will be manufactured. Feb 23 - German Chancellor Angela Merkel says at a joint news conference with French President Jacques Chirac that Germany and France will continue to support Airbus politically. Feb 27 - Airbus shakeup is approved by the board at parent  EADS. Feb 28 - Airbus management enter talks with unions as they confirm the sale of three sites in Europe while another three would get outside partners.
