 TOULOUSE, France  (Reuters) - The head of European planemaker Airbus criticized on Wednesday Japan, China and the United States for trying to deliberately exploit weaknesses in their currencies. 


 Airbus chief Louis Gallois told reporters that those countries were "playing a game of weak currency." Gallois was speaking as Airbus unveiled widespread job losses as part of a restructuring plan. He said Airbus' restructuring plan assumed a euro to U.S. dollar currency conversion rate of 1.35.
