 MELBOURNE  (Reuters) - Australian travel retailer Flight Center Ltd. ( FLT.AX ) said its planned A$1.62 billion ($1.28 billion) management buy-out did not receive shareholder approval at a meeting on Wednesday. 


 Flight Center spokesman Haydn Long said the plan did not receive the required 75 percent of shares eligible to vote. "It was not approved," he said. Company management, backed by investment firm Pacific Equity Partners, offered A$17.20 per share for the company last October. Analysts said the offer was high for a company with limited growth prospects as more people book flights and holidays directly on the Internet. Institutional investor Lazard Asset Management, which holds 12.5 percent of Flight Center, considered the A$17.20 offer too low, according to a report in the Australian Financial Review. Flight Center shares have been suspended from trading. The stock closed on Monday at A$16.89. ($1=A$1.27)
