 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Time Warner Cable Inc. expects 2007 revenue growth in the mid-to-high 30s percentage range, the company said on Wednesday, a day before its shares begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 


 Analysts called the outlook from the cable division of Time Warner Inc. ( TWX.N ) conservative, adding that they believed its stock would likely trade at a similar valuation to peers like Comcast Corp. ( CMCSA.O ) and Cablevision Systems Corp. ( CVC.N ) "While investors have been expecting Time Warner Cable to show significantly higher than peer group growth in 2007, we believe growth is likely to be more in line with Comcast and Cablevision," Pali Research analyst Richard Greenfield wrote in a research note. He forecast 2007 revenue at $16.75 billion, which would be a 42 percent rise from the $11.8 billion in revenue that Time Warner Cable had reported for 2006. Time Warner Cable also forecast operating income before depreciation and amortization (OIBDA) to grow in the mid- to high-30s percentage range in 2007. Greenfield was looking for OIBDA of $5.96 billion, up 42 percent from last year's $4.2 billion. He initiated coverage of the stock with a "neutral" rating. Time Warner Cable said it expects 2007 free cash flow of $800 million to $1 billion, driven by its strength as a video and Internet provider as well as the sale of new phone services to subscribers acquired from Adelphia Communications Corp. last year. Time Warner Cable, the second-largest cable operator in the United States, acquired 3.3 million subscribers from Adelphia and market leader Comcast acquired 1.7 million subscribers from the bankrupt cable operator. Greenfield said Adelphia was "driving the lion's share" of Time Warner Cable's growth. Excluding Adelphia, revenue and OIBDA growth would be in the low to mid teens, he said. That compares to Comcast's forecast that 2007 total revenue will increase by more than 11 percent, with operating cash flow climbing 13 percent or more. Cablevision has said it sees both metrics growing in the "mid-teens" percentage. Time Warner Cable, on a conference call with analysts, predicted strength in its older cable systems. "Underlying this outlook is our confident expectation of impressive growth in our legacy systems," said Chief Executive Glenn Britt, referring to systems excluding those it gained as part of the Adelphia deal. He added that significant operational improvements are expected in the latter part of 2007 through 2008 from the acquired systems. Time Warner Cable's TWCA.PK shares rose 95 cents to $38.75 on the Pink Sheets on Wednesday. Its enterprise value, or market capitalization plus net debt, trades on a when-issued basis of 8.5 times 2007 earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization based on Pali Research's estimates. That compares to Comcast's multiple of 8.2 and Cablevision's 8.3. Time Warner Cable, which will trade on the NYSE under the ticker symbol "TWC" ( TWC.N ), said it expected 2007 capital expenditure to rise by $600 million to $800 million.
