 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Rental-car operator Hertz Global Holding Inc. ( HTZ.N ) said on Wednesday it plans to cut 1,350 jobs resulting in annual savings of about $125 million as it seeks to improve competitiveness. 


 The cuts will be primarily in the company's car-rental operations in the United States, Hertz said. Smaller reductions will be made in its U.S. equipment rental business, its corporate headquarters in Park Ridge, New Jersey, and the U.S. service center in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. The company said it expects to book a charge of $9 million to $11 million in the first quarter to pay for the job cuts.
