 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Maybe you're saving too much for retirement. You may also be eating too many vegetables, spending too much time with the kids, exercising too regularly and doing your job too diligently. 


 Ha ha! Not bloody likely! A recent New York Times article raised the possibility that some workers were unnecessarily constraining their youth so they could throw all of their money at their 401(k) accounts. There might be a grain of truth in that. Academic research from the University of Wisconsin found that more than 80 percent of Americans have adequate retirement savings, and the remaining few who are undersaving have close to enough. That's kind of shocking, when considered against the drumbeat of all those "workers-are-woefully-unprepared" messages out there. Still, having just enough is a far cry from saving too much. There's virtually no downside risk to oversaving, unless you're so devoted to your IRA that your kids are going to bed hungry and going to school shoeless. If you save too much -- oh, well! -- you'll be able to drive a nicer car, travel more or give more help to your grandchildren during your golden years. Doesn't sound like much of a problem. Retirees, when interviewed, almost universally say they wished they'd saved more or are spending way more than they expected to. So, yes, keep up the saving. But here's a thought to take away from this new research: You may never actually save too much; but you may not be saving too little either. There are huge problems with most of the research that harps on the inadequacy of our national retirement savings. Many of those studies, for instance, assume workers will spend as much in their last year of retirement as in their first, when in fact their spending is likely to tail off completely. They assume that retirees will never sell their homes or downsize their life styles or situations. They project that workers will have the same or higher tax rates in retirement, though taxes tend to decline for retirees along with their incomes and/or if they move to lower tax states. They look at "average" 401k balances when many of those figures include workers just embarking on their careers. Many of these studies also seem to suggest that future retirees will run out of money, or be miserable if their savings are too low. It's more likely that, to make the money last, they will make small adjustments around the edges -- eating out less, traveling less, keeping the car longer, moving to a less expensive place. And, it's also extremely unlikely that they will allow tight funds in retirement to make them miserable, as long as they have enough for the necessities of life and a few extras. So, how do you know if you have enough and not too much? Continue to save, but don't let worry about insufficient savings paralyze you. Take a serious look at your monthly budget and strip away everything you won't have to spend on when you retire: commuting, the kids, college, work clothes, etc. Add in a healthy chunk for health care. Subtract your estimated monthly Social Security benefits (you can get a rough estimate at ssa.gov), and any other pension income you expect to get. What's left is the monthly income you have to raise from your savings. Multiply it by 20 percent (if you're willing to invest more aggressively and leave a smaller nest egg) or 25 percent (for a more conservative estimate), and that's the amount you should have in retirement savings when you retire. That amount, incidentally, is likely to take you through a lengthy retirement and still leave something for the kids. You can double check your math with some online retirement calculators, but remember that these may be more conservative than necessary. A couple to try are the ballpark calculator at  www.choosetosave.org  and the retirement calculator at  www.thriveq.com .
