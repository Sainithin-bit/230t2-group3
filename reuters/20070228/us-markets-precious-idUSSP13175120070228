 LONDON  (Reuters) - Nervous investors jumped in and out of the gold market on Wednesday as early bargain hunting gave way to renewed selling with financial markets trying to regain their poise after a global stock slide. 


 Spot gold traded in a wide $19 range, hitting the high for the day early at $679 as the sharp overnight drop attracted buyers in Asia and then Europe. But further jitters set in later in the day, hacking about $7 off prices in minutes before the price steadied again. It was quoted at $669.60/670.30 an ounce by 2:48 p.m. EST (1948 GMT), up from Tuesday's late quote in New York by $661.00/662.00. Most-active gold for April delivery on the COMEX division of the New York Mercantile Exchange settled down $14.70, or 2.1 percent, at $672.50 an ounce, traded in a range between $664.00 and $680.50. "It has all the signs of a market that is very jittery," said Peter Hillyard, head of precious metal sales at ANZ Investment Bank. "This is a nervous reaction to yesterday's move." On Wednesday, stock markets trimmed losses triggered a day earlier by a sudden plunge in China stocks that rippled through all markets and saw Wall Street record its biggest drop since the September 11, 2001 attacks. The Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard & Poor's 500 Index both rebounded but were up less than 1 percent in Wednesday afternoon trading. Although gold is often seen as a safe haven when other markets flounder, the precious metal was also hit as investors scrabbled to unwind investments elsewhere to meet their equity margin calls. Gold and other commodities saw a similar sell-off in May 2006 when a growing aversion to risk rippled through markets. Although analysts were not expecting the liquidation to be that severe, further selling pressure in stock markets could trigger more losses in gold. Base metals fell around three percent on Wednesday as fears of economic slowdown and falling demand in China cast a shadow over the market. $700 COMPROMISED Yesterday's volatile trade has damaged gold's attempt to get back above $700 in the near term, although analysts said fundamentally nothing had changed. Gold rallied to a nine-month high of $689 on Monday on safe-haven buying on the back of firm crude oil, tensions between Iran and the United States and a softer dollar, raising hopes the metal would eventually hit $700. Prices hit a 26-year high of $730 in May 2006. "In my view, we haven't killed this market yet," Hillyard said. "We may have knocked it about a bit, but it's recovering from the punches. But it may take a day or two before it's strong enough to resume its upward trend." Traders were bracing for more volatility. "With all that has happened and the dollar and oil where they are, gold is a bargain price here," one trader said. "It needs to break $778/79 to advance...it is only $25 away (from $700) and we have seen that range up, down and back up in the past few sessions. "But I think we need some sideways trade to let people recover and lick their wounds." Silver followed gold to trade lower. It dropped to $14.14/14.19 an ounce, down from $14.24/14.34 late in New York on Tuesday. Platinum was last quoted at $1,247/1,254, up from its previous close of $1,238/1,243, having earlier bounced to a fresh three-month high of $1,253. Palladium rebounded to trade higher at $350/355 from $348.50/353.00 an ounce late on Tuesday in New York. (Additional reporting by  Frank Tang  in New York)
