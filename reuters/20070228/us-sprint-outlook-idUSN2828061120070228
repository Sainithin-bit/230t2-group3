 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Sprint Nextel Corp. ( S.N ) expects to post first-quarter net losses of postpaid customers, who pay for calls in advance, but forecast postpaid net additions for the second quarter, Chief Financial Officer Paul Saleh said on Wednesday. 


 "Sequentially, we expect to report a similar number of postpaid subscriber losses in the first quarter of 2007 and postpaid net adds are expected to be positive in the second quarter and ramp up for the remainder of the year as our sale initiatives begin to take root," Saleh said during the company's fourth quarter earnings conference call. Sprint said it lost 306,000 postpaid customers in the fourth quarter.
