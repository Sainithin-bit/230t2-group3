 NEW YORK/LONDON  (Reuters) - Precious and base metal prices fell for a second straight day on Wednesday as fears of economic slowdown and falling demand in China prolonged a 


 sell-off analysts called overdone. Energy prices, down earlier in the day, recovered just before the close. Agricultural products like corn, wheat and soybeans notched sharp gains with funds buying back most of what was sold Tuesday. Gold for April delivery closed down 2 percent at $672.50 an ounce in New York futures trade. The spot price of gold touched a session bottom of $660, against Tuesday's close of $661.00/$662.00 in New York. Traders said investors have been selling gold to cover losses on global equity markets, which tumbled Tuesday amid talk that China could embark on a major credit tightening. China's benchmark Shanghai Composite Index  .SSEC  plunged nearly 9 percent Tuesday, its biggest drop in a decade. U.S. January durable goods orders also saw a sharp decline. Both developments rekindled worries about global economic growth, sending the Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  on Tuesday to its biggest nosedive since the attacks of September 11, 2001. The Dow edged higher on Wednesday. "If China stops growing then that ripples out across the world," said Saleem Siddiqi a partner at U.S.-based hedge fund firm Tapestry Asset Management. "The fear is the sluice gates may be closing," Siddiqi said. "If the Chinese start to withdraw, and slow their economy down, demand for assets like commodities pay the price." Some said high-flying commodity markets were ripe for a correction. Active U.S. copper for May hit a two-month high of $2.90 a lb on Monday, before diving on Tuesday and falling again on Wednesday to close down 2.6 percent at $2.7520. Crude oil on the New York Mercantile Exchange had risen to $61.44 a barrel two sessions ago, the highest since late December. It fell below $61 a barrel on Tuesday and slid more than 1 percent Wednesday to below $60 before closing at $61.79, up 33 cents. Some analysts said investors had overreacted. They said China was among the world's largest consumers and importers of oil and base metals and such commodities were subject to dynamics like producer supply and consumer demand -- as opposed to the financial flows that dominated stocks. They also said China may raise interest rates, but that will do little lasting damage to its economic growth. It also would not be likely to curb China's huge infrastructure spending, which requires commodities. "The Chinese situation has been largely misunderstood and China should continue to show economic growth ahead of expectations," said John Meyer at Numis Securities. "We see the current market correction as symptomatic of investors desire to lock in profits and to adjust portfolios. Oil prices at close to $61 a barrel are a greater concern as higher oil prices tend to raise inflation and dampen global growth," he said.
