 BOSTON  (Reuters) - Drugmaker Merck & Co. Inc. ( MRK.N ) boosted its 2007 earnings forecast on Wednesday, citing better-than-expected sales of multiple products, including its cancer vaccine Gardasil and diabetes drug Januvia. 


 The news sent Merck's shares 2.6 percent in mid-morning trading. "While we had always seen Merck's 2007 guidance as conservative and had expected the company to revise this, we had not anticipated an upward revision so early in the year," Jami Rubin, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, said in a research report. Merck said it expects first-quarter earnings of 63 cents to 67 cents a share, excluding restructuring charges related to site closures and job cuts. Analysts' average forecast was 60 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. "On face value, this is a modest plosive, in our view, but is not surprising," Chris Shibutani, an analyst at JP Morgan, said in a research report. Amy Rose, a spokeswoman for Whitehouse Station, New Jersey-based Merck, said newer products are performing better than expected, and several of the company's older products are also exceeding expectations, though she declined to give specifics on the older drugs. "With it being the end of February, we can better analyze the early revenue trends for some of the established products as well as the newly launched products," she said. Gardasil was approved last year as the first vaccine to prevent human papillomavirus (HPV), which causes cervical cancer. GlaxoSmithKline Plc ( GSK.L ) has a rival product called Cervarix in development. A potential rival to Merck's newly-launched diabetes drug Januvia received a blow recently after U.S. regulators asked for more data. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration requested a further clinical study of Novartis AG's ( NOVN.VX ) Galvus, potentially delaying approval of the drug by a year. Merck forecast 2007 earnings of $2.55 to $2.65 per share excluding special items, up from a January forecast of $2.51 to $2.59. The average Wall Street estimate is $2.63, according to Reuters Estimates. The company said its new forecast does not include any reserves for litigation related to lawsuits over the withdrawn painkiller Vioxx. It forecast 2007 net earnings of $2.40 to $2.55 a share. In its January forecast, Merck said it was on track to deliver double-digit compound annual earnings growth by 2010, excluding one-time items and restructuring charges. Merck shares were up $1.13 to $44.31 in mid-morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange. (Additional reporting by  Kim Dixon  in Chicago)
