 BOSTON  (Reuters) - Cable operator Charter Communications Inc. ( CHTR.O ) posted a wider quarterly loss on Wednesday as costs rose faster than sales and interest expenses increased. 


 The company reported a fourth-quarter net loss of $396 million, or $1.08 per share, compared with a loss of $336 million, or $1.06 per share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 9.8 percent to $1.4 billion, while costs and expenses climbed 10.8 percent to $910 million. Charter said it boosted spending on advertising and other efforts to sign up new customers and retain existing ones in the quarter. Higher programming expenses also contributed to the cost increases, it said. Adjusted for acquisitions and asset sales, revenue rose 11.7 percent, it said.
