 LONDON  (Reuters) - European stocks clawed back some of their early losses on Tuesday but remained mired in negative territory for a second day after a slide in Chinese stocks and weak U.S. economic data sparked a sell-off in global equities. 


 Banks and resources led the drop in Europe, where shares have nearly wiped out their gains for the year-to-date. Utilities were also in the spotlight as E.ON's bid for Spain's Endesa was threatened by Italy's Enel. "Is this the start of the long-awaited correction in equity markets? Probably not," said ING strategist Simon Goodfellow. "Is this a dress rehearsal for the correction we expect in the second quarter? Almost certainly, yes." By 1129 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of leading European shares had rebounded to be down 0.2 percent at 1,493.78 points, its lowest level since January 11. The index earlier fell as much as 2.2 percent. The slide follows a 3.3 percent fall in the Dow Jones industrial average and a 2.9 percent Nikkei drop. U.S. stock index futures pointed to a gain of around 1 percent for the Dow at the start of Wednesday trade. While traders said there was little fresh news driving markets on Wednesday, a build-up of worries this week -- from Iranian nuclear tensions to U.S. mortgage market worries to China's sudden stock market plunge -- have all been sufficient to dramatically alter market sentiment. China's main stock index bounced up 4 percent on Wednesday after falling 8.8 percent on Tuesday. "There's a very sharp turnaround in the pricing of risk," said Michael O'Sullivan, strategist at State Street Global Markets. "It's a case where something small triggers a shift in risk appetite -- there are always risks in the real world, the issue is how your price them. Now prices better reflect risk." BANKS SLIDE Banks ranked as the worst performing sector in Europe, with HBOS down 4 percent as worries over its margins spooked investors despite the mortgage lender beating market forecasts with a 14-percent rise in earnings. Elsewhere in the sector, Barclays fell 2.1 percent while Credit Suisse was down 2.7 percent. Miners languished, with Anglo American down 2.5 percent, while Xstrata fell 2.5 percent and BHP Billiton sank 1.5 percent despite stronger copper prices. Among utilities, E.ON was down 4.2 percent after Enel, its rival for Endesa, bought a 9.99 percent stake in the Spanish utility and said it could raise its holding to 24.99 percent. Enel shares fell 2.2 percent. On the upside, Volkswagen gained 4.4 percent after it raised its stake in MAN to 29.9 percent. Its Audi unit also upped its sales target. France's Carrefour added 2.8 percent on renewed speculation of a leveraged buyout, while software maker SAP gained 1.4 percent on talk the company was buying back shares. Elsewhere, shares in Sonaecom jumped 6.8 percent after it promised Portugal Telecom shareholders a payment package as part of its 11.8-billion-euro bid campaign.
