 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Station Casinos Inc. ( STN.N ), which is in the process of a management-led buyout, on Wednesday said fourth-quarter profit fell as it took charges for a canceled residential project and some pre-opening costs for some planned expansions. 


 Station, which operates casinos that cater to Las Vegas residents, said net income fell to $23.1 million, or 41 cents per share, from $41.7 million, or 61 cents per share, a year earlier.
