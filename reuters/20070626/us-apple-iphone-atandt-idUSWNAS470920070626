 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Apple Inc. and AT&T Inc. said on Tuesday they will offer three price plans, starting at $59.99 per month, for the widely anticipated iPhone that is set to go on sale this week. 

 The iPhone combines a wireless phone with music and video-playing capabilities and Web browsing. It will be sold exclusively through AT&T for at least two years. Individual monthly plans, based on a two-year service agreement with AT&T, will be priced at $59.99 for 450 minutes, $79.99 for 900 minutes and $99.99 for 1,350 minutes, the companies said, adding that family plans were also available. The plans include unlimited data, visual voice mail, 200 SMS text messages, roll-over minutes and unlimited mobile-to-mobile calling, they said. The device itself, whose key feature is a touch-sensitive screen, costs either $499 or $599 depending on whether it has 4 gigabytes or 8 gigabytes of flash memory. The iPhone is due to go on sale at Apple's retail stores and at AT&T outlets at 6 p.m. Friday. It will also be available at Apple's online stores. Apple shares have gained nearly 35 percent since it unveiled the phone in January. On Tuesday, the shares rose 1 percent in premarket trading from its close of $122.34 on Monday.
