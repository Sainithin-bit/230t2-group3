 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Visa, the world's largest credit card network, on Tuesday said it hired Hans Morris from Citigroup Inc. ( C.N ) to fill the new position of president of Visa Inc., which is planning to go public by early next year. 

 Visa also said John Philip Coghlan has resigned as president and chief executive of Visa USA, a post he had held since July 2005. John Partridge, president of Visa's Inovant LLC payment-processing affiliate, will become interim president of Visa USA. Morris, 48, will start at Visa Inc. on September 1. He will run Visa's income-generating businesses, and have oversight of relationships with issuers and merchants and the marketing of the Visa brand. He will move from New York to San Francisco, where Visa is based, and report to Chief Executive Joseph Saunders. Morris has spent his 27-year career at Citigroup and its predecessors. Since November 2002, he has been chief financial officer of Citigroup's corporate and investment banking unit, where he oversees 14,000 workers in more than 100 countries. He also sits on Citigroup's operating and management committees. Citigroup spokesman Daniel Noonan said the largest U.S. bank plans to announce a replacement for Morris soon. Morris was not immediately available for comment. Saunders became Visa Inc.'s chief executive last month. He had previously been president of card services at Washington Mutual Inc. ( WM.N ), the largest U.S. thrift. Visa in October outlined plans to float a majority of the company, now owned by its member banks, in an initial public offering to be held within 12 to 18 months. Visa Inc. will combine Visa USA, Visa International and Visa Canada. Its Visa Europe affiliate will remain a membership association and take a minority stake in Visa Inc. Smaller rival MasterCard Inc. ( MA.N ) went public in May 2006, and its shares have more than quadrupled in value since then. Visa Inc. intends to use IPO proceeds to fund expansion and an escrow account to cover potential legal bills. Merchants such as Kroger Co. ( KR.N ), Safeway Inc. ( SWY.N ) and Walgreen Co. ( WAG.N ) as well as rivals such as Morgan Stanley's ( MS.N ) Discover card unit and American Express Co. ( AXP.N ) have filed antitrust lawsuits against Visa and MasterCard.
