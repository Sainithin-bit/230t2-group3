 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - SCM Microsystems Inc. SCMM.O, a maker of smart-card reader technology, said on Tuesday its first-half revenues will be lower than previously thought, citing U.S. government budget freezes, demand in Asia and project delays in Europe. 

 SCM said first-half revenues will be about 20 percent below last year's levels, rather than flat to down slightly as it had indicated earlier. It said it was evaluating its full-year forecasts. SCM shares closed Monday at $3.57 on the Nasdaq.
