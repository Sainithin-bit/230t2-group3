 LONDON  (Reuters) - Britain declined comment on Tuesday on a U.S. corruption probe into Britain's BAE Systems Plc and said it stood by the decision to drop its own investigation into the company's dealings with Saudi Arabia. 

 "We have no comment to make whatsoever," Prime Minister Tony Blair's official spokesman told reporters. "Our position on the investigation in this country hasn't changed and we have no comment to make on what happens in the States." He also declined to comment on whether the British government would cooperate with the U.S. Department of Justice investigation, which was announced earlier on Tuesday.
