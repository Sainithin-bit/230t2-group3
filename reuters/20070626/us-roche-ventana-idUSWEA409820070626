 ZURICH/GENEVA  (Reuters) - Swiss drugmaker Roche Holding AG dug in for a takeover battle for Ventana Medical Systems Inc. on Tuesday as the U.S. company's shares traded above Roche's $3 billion hostile offer price. 

 Roche wants Ventana to strengthen its position in the emerging field of personalized medicine. Chief Executive Franz Humer said he aimed to continue the group's build-up of its diagnostics division beyond the Ventana deal through in-house development and the acquisition of technologies. "We've offered a very full premium and price and I would not speculate in any other direction," Humer told journalists on Tuesday, declining to say whether Roche would sweeten the bid. In a statement also released on Tuesday, Ventana said its board recommended shareholders take no action at this time. It will review Roche's offer and, following the start of the tender offer, make a recommendation to shareholders within 10 business days. Analysts said Roche's bid, which it launched after efforts to negotiate a friendly deal were rebuffed, looked expensive but made strategic sense. The proposed acquisition would further boost Roche's diagnostics or medical testing unit, where it has already made a series of small- to mid-sized acquisitions this year. The Basel-based company has agreed friendly takeovers of 454 Life Sciences from Curagen Corp., as well as U.S.-based BioVeris Corp. and privately held NimbleGen Systems Inc. Ventana's refusal to talk prompted Roche to take the unusual step of making a hostile offer at $75 per share in cash, a 45 percent premium to Ventana's closing stock price of $51.74 on Monday on Nasdaq. But Ventana shareholders expected more and its stock was trading at $76.87 early on Tuesday. Participation certificates in Roche, its most widely traded form of equity, were unchanged at 211.90 Swiss francs by 1310 GMT in a lower Swiss market. STRATEGIC LOGIC Acquiring Ventana, which specializes in tissue-based diagnostics, would give Roche, already one of the world's biggest diagnostic companies, access to technology that helps researchers and doctors better select the right drugs for individual patients. That concept, known as personalized medicine, could also reduce the costs and risks of developing drugs. Analysts said the deal fitted Roche's expansion plans and the large premium also signaled the strategic importance of diagnostics. "The addition of Ventana would help Roche to build a strong position in cancer diagnostics, an area where Roche has not been very present in the past," Vontobel analyst Karl-Heinz Koch said in a note. Although the full benefit of integrated diagnostics and pharmaceuticals is probably still years away, the deal would bring Roche close to that goal, Kepler Equities analyst Denise Anderson said. Anderson noted the deal would bring in-house for the first time a test to see which women would most benefit from using Roche's Hercepin in breast cancer. Roche said the deal would be earnings positive in two to three years on an operating level, and that would turn positive for core earnings per share within four years.
