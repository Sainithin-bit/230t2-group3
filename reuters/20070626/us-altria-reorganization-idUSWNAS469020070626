 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Altria Group Inc. ( MO.N ) on Tuesday said it plans to move its U.S.-based cigarette production for non-U.S. markets to its facilities in Europe and will close its Cabarrus, N.C., manufacturing facility by the end of 2010. 

 The parent company of Phillip Morris tobacco cited declining U.S. cigarette volume for moving production to Europe. The Cabarrus facility employs about 2,500 people. Altria said it plans to consolidate U.S. cigarette manufacturing in Richmond, Va., and that Philip Morris International will shift the sourcing of about 57 billion cigarettes from Cabarrus to Europe by the third quarter of 2008. The company expects to record an initial pre-tax charge of about $325 million, or 10 cents a share, in the second quarter for costs related to the program, with additional estimated charges of about $50 million for the remainder of 2007. Altria said it expects total annual pre-tax cost savings of about $335 million by 2011 and sees additional charges of about $50 million for the remainder of 2007.
