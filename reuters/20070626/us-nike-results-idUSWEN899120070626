 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Nike Inc. ( NKE.N ) posted higher fourth-quarter net profit on Tuesday, beating Wall Street estimates and sending shares up 4 percent in extended trade, as strong sales of Nike-branded footwear helped offset overall challenges in the U.S. athletic shoe market. 

 The world's top maker of athletic shoes and apparel said quarterly net profit rose 32 percent to $437.9 million, or 86 cents per share, compared with $332.8 million, or 64 cents per share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 9 percent to $4.38 billion. Excluding items, earnings were 90 cents a share. That beat analysts' average expectations of earnings of 86 cents, excluding items, on revenue of $4.36 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. Beaverton, Oregon-based Nike said that global futures orders for delivery of footwear and apparel from June through November rose 12 percent. In the United States, futures orders rose 7 percent, Nike said. That compares to the 5 percent expected by Goldman Sachs and the low- to mid-single digits growth projected by Susquehanna Financial. In the year-ago period, Nike's U.S. forward orders rose 9 percent. Favorable currency exchange rates boosted revenue growth by 2 percentage points, Nike said. The results appeared to allay some concern over sluggishness in the U.S. athletic shoe market. Nike's two largest U.S. customers, Foot Locker Inc. ( FL.N ) and Finish Line Inc.( FINL.O ), have experienced weakness in same-store sales. Nike has been working on store initiatives to help its retail partners and has offered shoes at a broader range of price points to appeal to cost-conscious shoppers. Shares of Nike trade at over 16 times expected 2008 earnings, at a premium to the multiple paid for German rivals Adidas AG ADSG.DE and Puma AG ( PUMG.DE ), at nearly 14 and 16 times forward-looking earnings, respectively. Nike shares are up 10 percent since the beginning of the year. Shares of Nike rose 4 percent to $56.02 in after-hours trade, after closing at $53.82 on the New York Stock Exchange.
