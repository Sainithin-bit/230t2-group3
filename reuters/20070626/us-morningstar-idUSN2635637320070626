 BOSTON  (Reuters) - Strong global stocks and bonds markets have fueled rapid growth in the $11.1 trillion U.S. mutual fund industry, despite the wobble in emerging markets and concerns about overheated Chinese markets in the past year. 

 But for the industry, whose assets have grown by $1 trillion in the past six months, will it be different with the subprime mortgage mess? The fallout from the subprime woes, which is threatening to engulf hedge funds, and the impact of rising global interest rates on mutual funds, will be main themes at Morningstar's annual investment conference this week. "I'm very interested to see how the subprime issue is perceived," said Lee Schultheis, chief investment strategist at AIP Funds, which runs mutual funds employing hedge fund strategies and will be an exhibitor at the conference. "There have been a lot of folks going into mortgage backed securities, maybe not necessarily subprime, but more risky credits or high yield. And the interesting thing will be if the subprime area does have a real problem, will it then have some ripple affects where it might impact negatively some of those other spaces?" Schultheis said. That will be a subject many of the 40 speakers at the three-day conference will try to address. The conference is being held in Chicago, headquarters of research firm Morningstar Inc. ( MORN.OQ ), and the firm expects it to draw about 1,500 attendees. "A lot of change is afoot in the investment landscape," said Don Phillips, managing director at Morningstar. The sessions on indexing, foreign stocks, hard assets and embracing of hedge fund strategies by mutual funds are reflective of that change, Phillips said. The conference features some leading industry executives as speakers, including Gus Sauter, chief investment officer of Vanguard Group, Jeremy Siegel, Wharton school professor, Bob Doll, BlackRock Inc.'s ( BLK.N ) chief investment officer for equities and Lew Sanders, chief executive of AllianceBernstein  LP ( AB.N ). Attendees will also get a rare chance to hear the views of the hugely successful but publicity shunning Capital Research and Management Company, which has $1.1 trillion in assets and runs the American Funds family of mutual funds. Capital's chairman Jim Rothenberg will give the keynote address on June 28. "When he does (talk), you want to be there," said Jeffrey Coons, a portfolio manager with Manning & Napier Advisors.
