 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. consumer confidence fell further than expected to a 10-month low in June as Americans grew anxious about jobs and the business climate, a survey showed on Tuesday. 

 The Conference Board said its index of consumer sentiment slid to 103.9 in June, the lowest since August 2006, from an upwardly revised 108.5 in May. The median forecast of economists polled by Reuters was for 105.5, down from an originally reported May reading of 108.0. "A perceived softening in present-day business and employment conditions are the major reasons behind this month's pull-back in confidence," said Lynn Franco, director of the Conference Board Consumer Research Center. The business research group's present situation index fell to 127.9 in June -- its lowest level since November 2006. It stood at 136.1 in May. The expectations index slipped to 87.9 from an upwardly revised 90.1 a month ago. Optimism about labor market conditions waned in June, the report showed. Consumers surveyed who said jobs were "plentiful" fell to 27.0 percent from an upwardly revised 29.1 percent the prior month. Those who said jobs were "hard to get" edged up to 21.1 percent from a downwardly revised 19.7 percent in May. Consumers' expectations for the inflation rate 12 months from now held at 5.4 percent in June, steady with May's downwardly revised reading, but above 5.1 percent a year ago.
