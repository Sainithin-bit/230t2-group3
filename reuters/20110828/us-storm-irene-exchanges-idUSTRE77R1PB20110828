 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Main stock exchanges Nasdaq, NYSE and BATS expect to open trading on Monday as usual despite Hurricane Irene, although a final decision, especially on opening the Big Board floor, is yet to come. 

 The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and market operators NYSE Euronext, Nasdaq OMX Group and others plan a conference call at 1 p.m. ET Sunday to discuss power outages and New York City transportation, sources familiar with the plan said on Sunday. (Reporting by  Jonathan Spicer )
