 BOSTON  (Reuters) - Diversified manufacturer 3M Co ( MMM.N ) plans to cut 141 jobs at its U.S. display and graphics unit, which makes products including films for use in liquid-crystal-display televisions, a spokeswoman said on Wednesday. 

 The company, which also makes Scotch tape and Thinsulate insulation, said it would cut 63 jobs in Maplewood, Minnesota, and 78 in Cincinnati, spokeswoman Jacqueline Berry said in an interview. The jobs, which are in a variety of functions, will be eliminated through layoffs and attrition, Berry said. In October, 3M said demand for optical films for high-end LCD TVs is slowing and that it would look to offer new products in the low end of the market, which is more popular but offers lower margins. 3M employs about 75,000 people worldwide.
