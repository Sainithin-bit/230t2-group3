 (Reuters) - ConAgra Foods Inc ( CAG.N ) said its second-quarter earnings from continuing operations will be higher than planned due to stronger-than-expected performance in its trading and merchandising segment and its food and ingredients segment. 

 Previously, the company had said it expected second-quarter earnings from continuing operations to be in line with the year-ago amounts. (Reporting by Swagata Gupta in Bangalore; Editing by Deepak Kannan)
