 LONDON  (Reuters) - OPEC agreed on Wednesday not to change oil output levels at its meeting in Abu Dhabi and will review this decision at another meeting at the end of January. nL0510730 

 ANALYSTS' COMMENT: JOHN HALL OF JOHN HALL ASSOCIATES "I'm very disappointed that OPEC has not taken this opportunity to increase output in the face of renewed higher prices" "They will be giving another opportunity to speculators to push the market up closer to the $100 level in the short term and, so doing, curtail demand further and encourage increased investment in alternative fuel." HARRY TCHILINGUIRIAN, SENIOR ENERGY ANALYST AT BNP PARIBAS IN LONDON "The postponement of a decision only means that the supply gap between global oil demand growth and non-OPEC supply growth will be met by a draw in inventories in consuming countries as we move into the peak winter demand season. That remains bullish for prices." PAUL HORSNELL, HEAD OF COMMODITIES RESEARCH AT BARCLAYS CAPITAL "In reality there really weren't any boxes that could be checked in forming any consensus for an increase. "The market was only in very mild backwardation, the ghost of Jakarta was being invoked, prices had been falling, many members thought that not enough attrition in OECD inventories had occurred yet. "The last increase has not filtered through yet and so there was an increase already in progress. In short, the only thing we think that could have driven through an increase would have been prices in the mid-90s showing some upwards momentum." HELEN HENTON, HEAD OF COMMODITY RESEARCH AT STANDARD  CHARTERED BANK "I think it shows that OPEC are worried about what's happening to demand, so they don't want to flood the market with oil. "Given that the price has been falling for the past few days they probably didn't want to send a very strong bearish signal. But leaving the door open in January to increase is sweetening the message I suppose. "The price is not really moving on fundamentals at the moment. It's moving on perceptions of where those fundamentals are going. There were some quite strong bearish signals in the market over the last few days so this may bring some support to pries above $80. "Because the dollar has weakened so much over the past few months I think OPEC's price aspirations have probably shifted higher. So where they will want it next year will depend on what's happening to the dollar. "We think the dollar will bounce back in the first half." SIMON WARDELL, ANALYST AT GLOBAL INSIGHT "I don't think it's a huge surprise because the oil price went down so dramatically... That really allowed them to do what they always wanted to do, which was just maintain production quotas as they are. "Obviously they are a bit concerned about the economic outlook and the prospects for demand next year. They were keen to keep things steady, maybe look again when we get an idea of what the winter weather is going to be like."
