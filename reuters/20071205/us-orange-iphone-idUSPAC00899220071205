 PARIS  (Reuters) - France Telecom FTE.PA said on Wednesday that its Orange division had already sold close to 30,000 iPhones in France since its launch there last week. 

 The French launch of Apple Inc's ( AAPL.O ) iPhone saw hundreds of buyers queue up outside Orange's flagship store on Paris' Champs-Elysees, in a similar frenzy to the ones just after its initial launch in New York and elsewhere in Europe earlier this year. The iPhone combines usual mobile phone devices with the facilities of an iPod music player, an Internet browser and other multimedia options.
