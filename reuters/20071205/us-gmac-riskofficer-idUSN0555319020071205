 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - GMAC Financial Services, the finance firm owned by Cerberus Capital Management LP and General Motors Corp ( GM.N ), is expected to name a chief risk officer as early as Wednesday, the Wall Street Journal said in its online edition. 

 The newspaper said Sam Ramsey -- who joined the company as treasurer in September -- will run GMAC's newly created risk management division. David Walker, who head's GMAC's global borrowings segment, will take over as treasurer, the Journal added. The moves are the latest steps in GMAC's restructuring of its executive posts following a third-quarter which saw the firm post a $1.6 billion loss. Last month, GMAC named Robert Hull chief financial officer and reassigned former CFO Sanjiv Khattri as executive vice president of Corporate Development and Strategy. GMAC representatives could not immediately be reached for comment. (Writing by  Justin Grant ; Editing by  Valerie Lee )
