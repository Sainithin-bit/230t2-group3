 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Children's Place Retail Stores Inc ( PLCE.O ) filed four delayed quarterly reports with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday and said it was now in compliance with Nasdaq listing standards, sending its shares up more than 5 percent in extended trading. 

 The company, which operates both its own children's apparel stores and the Disney Stores chain through a license agreement with Walt Disney Co ( DIS.N ), faced delisting by the Nasdaq stock market if it failed to file its delinquent statements by a January 9 deadline. "With this filing, the company is current with its required reports and believes it has regained compliance with Nasdaq's listing requirements," the company said in a filing. A review of the retailer's historical stock options practices delayed filing of three quarterly reports from 2006, while the delay of a second quarter 2007 report came because the company said it needed to review policy violations by two employees. Children's Place said in one filing that it was restating its financial statements to reflect additional stock-based compensation costs related to options grants from fiscal 1997 through the first quarter of fiscal 2006. The aggregate impact of the stock-based compensation adjustments from fiscal 1998 to the first quarter of fiscal 2006 was a net income decrease of about $11.2 million, the company said. Adjustments not related to stock options between fiscal 2001 and the first quarter of fiscal 2006 increased net income by about $1.7 million, it said. The Secaucus, New Jersey company has had a string of problems this year, marked by former Chief Executive Ezra Dabah stepping down in September after an internal probe found he did not comply with its securities-trading policies. Dabah remains on the company's board of directors. In August, the company said that two employees, one being a named, executive officer, had violated the company's internal policies and procedures. A filing released on Wednesday said that independent counsel had investigated an options grant made to Dabah in connection with the company's initial public offering in 1997. "Certain unauthorized actions were taken" related to that grant in May 2004, the company said in a filing. Children's Place shares rose over 5 percent to $30.99 in after-hours trading after closing on Nasdaq at $29.39, up 2 percent. (Reporting by  Alexandria Sage ; Editing by  Andre Grenon )
