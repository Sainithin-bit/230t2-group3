 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The manager of the world's biggest bond fund said on Wednesday the situation of bond insurer MBIA Inc ( MBI.N ) shows the banking system needs more capital. 

 "MBIA is simply a reflection of the shadow banking system," said Bill Gross, chief investment officer at Pacific Investment Management Co. or Pimco, speaking on CNBC television. "The entire banking system requires more capital," and needs to get it more cheaply, he added. Earlier, credit rating agency Moody's Investors Service said the risk of a capital shortfall at MBIA was greater than previously estimated. Shoring up the financial system "requires substantially lower interest rates," said Gross, noting that the wide spread of Libor or the London Interbank Offered Rate over the U.S. federal funds rate shows "the system is not working the way it should." Gross also said municipal bonds' current tax-free yields are attractive compared with those of taxable Treasury bonds. Gross said the spread of the U.S. discount rate over the target rate could be narrowed. The discount rate, at which banks can borrow directly from the Federal Reserve, stands at 5.0 percent. The fed funds target rate for interbank borrowing stands at 4.5 percent. The Federal Reserve could change either or both of these rates at its next regular policy setting meeting which is on December 11.
