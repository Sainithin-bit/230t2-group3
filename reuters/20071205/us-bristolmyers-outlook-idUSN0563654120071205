 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co on Wednesday said it expects its annual earnings to grow by at least 15 percent between 2008 and 2010, helped by savings from restructuring and growing sales of newer prescription drugs. 

 Chief Financial Officer Andrew Bonfield, in a company meeting with industry analysts, also said Bristol-Myers expects its annual sales to grow in the mid-to-high single-digit percentage range during the same three year-period. Bonfield said he expects the company's annual spending on research and development during the period to rise in the mid-single-digit percentage range.
