 HONG KONG  (Reuters) - Investment banking fees in the Asia Pacific region rose 36 percent to a record $11.7 billion so far this year -- roughly the gross domestic product of oil-rich Brunei -- with UBS ( UBSN.VX ) and Goldman Sachs ( GS.N ) the top earners. 

 Data from publisher Thomson Financial and consultant Freeman & Co showed that fee growth in the region, excluding Japan, was driven by mergers and acquisitions in the financial services and materials sectors. M&A deals accounted for 53.1 percent of the fees with the equity capital markets business delivering 37 percent. Debt capital markets followed with a 5.9 percent share and loans contributed 4 percent. Four Chinese initial public offerings took the top spots, with the combined $28 billion worth of deals generating $392 million in fees. China Citic Bank's ( 0998.HK ) $5.4 billion simultaneous listing in Hong Kong and Shanghai raised an estimated $119.6 million in fees for deal arrangers China International Capital Corp, CITIC Securities, Citigroup ( C.N ), HSBC ( HSBA.L ), and Lehman Brothers LEH.N. China Construction Bank's ( 0939.HK ) $7.7 billion IPO gave bankers $115.9 million in fees, followed by the IPO deals for China Railway ( 601390.SS ) and China Shenhua ( 601088.SS ). The takeover by Australia's Wesfarmers WES.AX of retailer Coles Group CGJ.AX came in fifth highest, yielding fees of $67.2 million. Despite a seize-up in credit markets in the second half of the year, global M&A activity has jumped so far this year to a record $4.3 trillion worth of deals, from $3.9 trillion in 2006, according to data provider Dealogic. UBS topped Thomson's Asia-Pacific league table, earning $701.7 million in fees so far this year, or a 34.3 percent increase from 2006, with just over half coming from equity capital markets. Second-ranked Goldman Sachs earned $523.8 million in fees in 2007, marking a 17.9 percent increase from last year. Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ) posted the biggest gain of any of the banks, with a 76.6 percent increase from last year to $495.5 million to rank it third. Citigroup ( C.N ) was fourth for the year so far, with $447.8 million in fees, a 9.3 percent increase from 2006. (Editing by  Dominic Whiting )
