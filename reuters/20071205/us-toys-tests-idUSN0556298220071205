 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Tests on about 1,200 children's items by a group of consumer and environmental health organizations revealed more than a third contained lead and other potentially harmful chemicals, including mercury, cadmium and arsenic, the Wall Street Journal said Wednesday in its online edition. 

 The study also showed that jewelry products were most likely to contain high lead levels, and it uncovered a variety of tainted items, including bedroom slippers, bath toys and card-game cases, according to the Journal. Certain toys had more than five times the standard safety level, including a Hannah Montana card-game case, which had a lead level of 3,056 parts per million, the Journal said. Millions of toys have been recalled this year, with most involving Chinese-made products. "We're publishing the results of our test with the hope that we can urge the government to do this kind of thing themselves," Tracey Easthope, director of the Environmental Health Project of the Ecology Center, told the Journal. The Michigan-based Environmental Health Project of the Ecology Center spearheaded the project, the Journal said. (Editing by Quentin Bryar)
