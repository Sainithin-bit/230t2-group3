 ATHENS  (Reuters) - Talks among Greek political leaders on reforms needed for a new IMF/EU bailout for the country will continue on Monday, far-right leader George Karatzaferis said on Sunday. 
 Asked whether the leaders of the three coalition parties had reached an agreement, Karatzaferis told reporters: "We will continue tomorrow." His LAOS party is in the coalition of Prime Minister Lucas Papademos, along with the conservative and socialist parties. "I won't contribute to the explosion of a revolution due to misery," Karatzaferis added. (Reporting by Angeliki Koutantou and Harry Papachristou)
