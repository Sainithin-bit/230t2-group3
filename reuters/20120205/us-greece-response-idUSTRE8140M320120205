 ATHENS  (Reuters) - Leaders of the three parties in the Greek coalition government must respond to proposals made by the country's international lenders for a new bailout deal by noon (1000 GMT) on Monday, a spokesman for the PASOK socialist party said on Sunday. 
 "Political leaders should give a response in principle tomorrow afternoon (to the European Union)," PASOK party spokesman Panos Beglitis told reporters. They would later discuss the plan by the "troika" of international lenders at a meeting chaired by Prime Minister Lucas Papademos. "There will be a political leaders' meeting chaired by Mr. Papademos tomorrow afternoon," Beglitis said. (Reporting by Angeliki Koutantou and Harry Papachristou; editing by  David Stamp  )
