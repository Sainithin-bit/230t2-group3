 ATLANTA  (Reuters) - Retailer Lowe's Cos Inc ( LOW.N ) said on Monday its third-quarter profit fell 10 percent and it cut its full-year forecast as the U.S. housing slump hurt sales, sending its shares to a four-year low. 

 Results at home improvement retailers have weakened as slowing home sales, lower home prices and tightening of credit standards hurt consumer spending on big-ticket projects such as kitchen renovations. "Is it the end of the trouble? I don't think we're even close to the bottom," said Michael Souers, an analyst with Standard & Poor's. "I think it's more likely to be the back half of 2008 if not later when we see a turn in the housing market." Lowe's, which had also cut its full-year outlook in late September, said during its conference call that resetting adjustable-rate mortgages and rising energy costs were other pressures on consumers. The second-biggest home improvement chain behind Home Depot Inc ( HD.N ) said earnings came to $643 million, or 43 cents a diluted share, for the quarter ended November 2, from $716 million, or 46 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding a 5 cents a share reduction in insurance liabilities tied to workers compensation, profit was 38 cents a share, below the 41 cents a share analysts expected, according to Reuters Estimates. "The miss vs. guidance suggests the environment deteriorated markedly through the quarter," Sanford Bernstein analyst Colin McGranahan said in a research note. Total sales rose 3.2 percent to $11.6 billion, short of analysts' expectations of $11.78 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. Sales at stores open at least a year fell 4.3 percent. Lowe's cited lower home sales and falling home prices, said drought in the U.S. South hurt plant sales and cited lower- than-expected Gulf Coast sales. "During the quarter, it was difficult to sustain sales momentum across much of the country," Lowe's Chairman Robert Niblock said. Still, Lowe's said independent estimates showed it was gaining market share. Gross margin shrank to 34.27 percent of sales from 34.47 percent a year earlier, as Lowe's cut prices on seasonal goods such as air conditioners to spur sales. Home Depot posted a 27 percent fall in quarterly profit last week and forecast a steeper fall in earnings for the full year. The Atlanta retailer said it was continuing to lose home improvement market share, although at a lower rate compared with the year earlier. Lowe's, based in Mooresville, North Carolina, expects pressures from the U.S. housing slump to extend well into next year. It forecast per-share profit of 25 cents to 29 cents for the fourth quarter and $1.83 to $1.87 for the full year ending in February. In late September, Lowe's had said full-year profit would come in at the low end or slightly below a prior forecast of $1.97 to $2.01 a share. Analysts currently expect profit of 36 cents a share for the fourth period and $1.93 a share for the year, according to Reuters Estimates. Lowe's shares closed down $1.89, or 7.6 percent, at $23.12 on the New York Stock Exchange, a level not seen since August 2003 on a split-adjusted basis. Home Depot was off 88 cents, or 3 percent, to $28.19. Lowe's stock has fallen 26 percent this year, while Home Depot is down nearly 30 percent. (Reporting by Karen Jacobs; editing by  Andre Grenon )
