 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Upscale department store chain Nordstrom Inc. ( JWN.N ) reported higher quarterly net earnings on Monday, helped by a gain from the sale of its Faconnable business and an extra week compared with the same period last year. 

 The Seattle retailer said earnings came to $165.7 million, or 68 cents a share, for the quarter ended November 3, compared with $135.7 million, or 52 cents a share, a year earlier. (Reporting by  Nichola Groom )
