 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Hewlett-Packard Co ( HPQ.N ) saw no change in spending from financial-services customers in its fiscal fourth quarter, Chief Executive Mark Hurd said on Monday. 

 "We do not have a huge exposure to the financial services industry," Hurd told reporters on a conference call after HP, the world's largest personal computer maker, reported fiscal fourth-quarter results. "We saw no change in spending in financial services in the quarter." Hurd also said that pricing for its products "was actually fine" in the period and that lower component costs helped improve the company's gross profit margin.
