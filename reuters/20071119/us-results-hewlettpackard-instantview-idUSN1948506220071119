 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Hewlett-Packard Co ( HPQ.N ), the world's largest personal computer maker, on Monday reported a higher quarterly profit as notebook PC sales increased. 

 COMMENTS: BRENT BRACELIN, ANALYST, PACIFIC CREST SECURITIES "Great numbers, great quarter, but it doesn't matter. All that matters is the commentary around their business (on the conference call). "This is a really, really tough tech tape, this stock has been one of the best performing stocks in the past two years. I can't explain the disconnect (between good earnings and stock's early fall) other than that people are very worried about spending on IT (information technology)."
