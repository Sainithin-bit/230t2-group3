 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Target Corp ( TGT.N ) said on Monday it still expects November sales at stores open at least a year to rise between 2 percent to 4 percent, adjusted for a calendar shift. 

 For November and December, Target has said its same-store sales will be affected by a change in the monthly retail calendar this year compared with last year. Without the adjustment, November same-store sales should rise in the low double-digit range, it said. (Reporting by  Alexandria Sage )
