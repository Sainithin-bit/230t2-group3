 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Shares of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac sank to 10-year lows on Monday over new worries that a spike in U.S. home foreclosures will boost losses at the two mortgage finance companies. 

 Gloomy expectations from analysts helped push shares of Fannie Mae FNM.N down 7.6 percent, while Freddie Mac FRE.N shares fell 7.9 percent. The day's battering comes after several weeks of bloodletting for Fannie and Freddie, which investors now fear may be more vulnerable to mortgage woes than first thought. "Investors are shooting first and asking questions later when it come to Fannie and Freddie," said Marshall Front, chairman of Front Barnett Associates, LLC of Chicago. Monday's sell-off was sparked, in part, by concerns that the companies may not have made enough allowances for bad loans, rattling Wall Street because both companies have recently been through bruising accounting scandals, said Front, an investment counselor. "Given their recent problems, this is an issue that investors find hard to swallow," he said. In a research note on Monday, Credit Suisse said Freddie Mac may see a loss of between $1 billion to $5 billion on its subprime "AAA" portfolio. The latest estimate comes one day ahead of Freddie's third-quarter earnings report. Until recently, such highly rated bonds were thought to be shielded from woes in the subprime mortgage market for subprime loans. Separately, Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co downgraded Fannie Mae's stock to "market perform" from "outperform," slashed its target share price, and removed Fannie from its "Top Picks" list, citing concerns related to the impact of credit costs on the company's valuation. The latest analysts' outlooks further drove down the value of the nation's two largest sources of home loan financing. Freddie Mac shares on Monday closed down 40 percent from the start of the year at $37.50, while Fannie shares finished at $37.58, down roughly 30 percent in that time. As recently as late in the summer, investors had believed Fannie and Freddie were uniquely poised to mop up profits in the downcast housing market. The two government-sponsored enterprises specialize in buying traditional, 30-year mortgages and have not been leaders in the subprime market, which serves borrowers with damaged credit and has recently seen an increase in defaults. In early August, Fannie Mae Chief Executive Officer Daniel Mudd said his company could play a role as housing market savior by buying some now-troubled loans. Fannie Mae's shares started sinking in early October, and earlier this month Mudd said Fannie's loan losses were set to double in 2008. During a conference call Friday, analysts grilled the company on how it accounts for loans that fail and are subsequently bought back from investors. Freddie executives are likely to face similar questions when the company announces third-quarter earnings Tuesday. Fannie and Freddie try to recover, or "cure," potential losses from failing loans that they are forced to buy back from investors. If the two companies do not meet their goals of curing loans, their losses will be greater than expected. Josh Rosner, a housing analyst with independent research firm Graham Fisher & Co. in New York, said investors have never understood how successful Fannie and Freddie are at curing loans and so are skeptical now. "Without historic or empirical data from the positive side of the (housing) cycle the market is not willing to give them the benefit of the doubt," he said. Jim Vogel, who tracks the companies for FTN Financial in Memphis, Tennessee, meanwhile, said that loan losses were so low during the recent housing boom and the cure rate was so high that investors are overreacting now that the number of bad loans is swelling. "The credit loss metrics were so low for so long that the market just does not know how to wrap its head around these new expected loss numbers," he said.
