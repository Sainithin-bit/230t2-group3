 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Hewlett-Packard Co ( HPQ.N ) expects prices for computer components to be "moderately less favorable" in its fiscal first quarter compared with the fourth quarter, Chief Financial Officer Kathy Lesjak said on Monday. 

 HP, the world's largest personal computer maker, benefited from lower prices for memory and other components in the fourth quarter, Chief Executive Mark Hurd said on Monday. "The pricing environment is expected to be generally favorable, although maybe a little bit less than in Q4," Hurd told analysts on a conference call after HP reported fiscal fourth-quarter results. "There's tightness in some categories but in other categories, there's pretty ample supply." (Reporting by  Philipp Gollner ; Editing by  Braden Reddall )
