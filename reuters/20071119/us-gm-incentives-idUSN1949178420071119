 DETROIT  (Reuters) - General Motors Corp ( GM.N ) shares dropped to their lowest in 16 months on Monday as investors reacted to fears of a deepening slump in U.S. auto sales and a mortgage crisis that has prompted concerns about the outlook for former GM finance unit GMAC. 

 GM shares closed down almost 8.5 percent on the New York Stock Exchange at $26.79. The drop was the largest single day decline in percentage terms for GM shares in over two years and took the stock to its lowest level since June 2006. The decline in GM stock wiped out the last gains from a rally that began in September in anticipation of a cost-cutting labor deal between GM and the United Auto Workers union and was matched by a sell-off in bonds issued by GMAC's ResCap unit. ResCap bonds plunged on Monday and the cost to insure GMAC bonds rose. Investors said ResCap, the second-largest independent U.S. mortgage lender, could face the need for a further capital injection to avoid violating loan agreements. JP Morgan analyst Himanshu Patel said a ResCap bankruptcy could cost GM shareholders about $2.65 per share, adding it was doubtful whether GM would take part in a bailout for the company. "We doubt GM has much appetite for such a bailout given the arguably much-faster ... returns it can earn on its precious capital," Patel said in a note for clients. Lehman Brothers analyst Brian Johnson said there was evidence of increasing delinquency on the auto loans of GMAC and Ford Motor Co ( F.N ), suggesting a spillover from subprime mortgage problems. The credit concerns combined with an increasingly pessimistic outlook for U.S. auto sales in 2008 to send GM and Ford shares lower, other analysts said. Investors have been concerned about GM's exposure to the subprime market through GMAC, in which it retains a 49 percent stake. GMAC's ResCap, lost $2.26 billion in the third quarter. GM's U.S. vehicle sales have slipped 6 percent this year as the automaker struggles with tough competition, high gas prices and a weak housing market. In a concession to the softer market, GM said on Monday it was offering zero-percent financing to clear out 2007 inventory and also offering dealer incentives for 2008 models. The "Red Tag" sale, which ends January 2, includes no-interest loans for five years on almost all 2007 models of Chevrolet, Pontiac, Buick, GMC and Saturn. "There seems to be an implicit outlook for weaker car sales in this new incentive program," Burnham Securities analyst David Healy said. U.S. vehicle sales in 2007 are expected to fall to the lowest since 1998 and industry experts are anticipating a tougher year in 2008. Thomas Stallkamp, a partner with private equity firm Ripplewood Holdings, said at the Reuters Autos Summit on Sunday that U.S. sales could dip to 14.5 million units in 2008, which would be the lowest tally in 15 years. Jerry York, an adviser to billionaire investor Kirk Kerkorian, also said at the same event that U.S. light vehicle sales could slip to 15.5 million units or less next year. An investor group led by Cerberus Capital Management bought a 51 percent stake in GMAC last November from GM in a deal worth around $14 billion, leaving the automaker with a 49 percent stake. At the time, analysts said ResCap was the crown jewel in the deal. GMAC's other subsidiaries provide automotive financing, commercial finance, insurance and real-estate services. Ford shares dropped almost 5 percent on Monday to close at  $7.34. (Additional reporting by  Doris Frankel  and  Ben Klayman , editing by Maureen Bavdek and  Andre Grenon )
