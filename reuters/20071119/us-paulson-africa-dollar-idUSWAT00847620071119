 AKOSOMBO, Ghana  (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson on Monday repeated that U.S. economic strength should eventually show through in currency markets, implying that would help bolster the dollar's value. 

 At a news conference after touring the Akosombo dam hydroelectric project outside Ghana's capital, Accra, Paulson volunteered his strong-dollar refrain after being asked about the impact of high energy prices. "A strong dollar is in our nation's interest and our economy, like any other, has its ups and downs. But I believe our economy will continue to grow and our long term economic strength will be reflected in currency markets," he said. (Reporting by  Glenn Somerville ; Editing by  James Dalgleish )
