 LONDON  (Reuters) - Britain said on Monday that its rescue of Northern Rock NRK.L would have to be approved by the European Union and that any bid for the stricken bank would be at risk if it required more assistance from the government. 

 "Any ongoing State Aid measures beyond those currently in the course of notification to the European Commission would represent a potential risk to value and execution, because the European Commission may impose adverse conditions and may take additional time to approve such State Aid," the finance ministry said in a statement. "Proposals will be assessed against this backdrop, and should demonstrate how they have taken account of the State Aid rules in their development. All other things being equal, any proposal will be viewed favorably in so far as it is not conditional upon European Commission approval of further aid measures."
