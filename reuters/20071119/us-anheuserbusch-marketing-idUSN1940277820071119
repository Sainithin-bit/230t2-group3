 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Anheuser-Busch Cos Inc ( BUD.N ) is planning to invest more next year in television advertisements for four of its core brands -- Budweiser, Bud Light, Michelob and Michelob Ultra -- and reduce spending on smaller brands like Bud Select and Rolling Rock, the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday. 

 The new ad campaigns will increase emphasis on the ingredients in its beers and how they're brewed, the Journal said in its online edition. Representatives from Anheuser-Busch were not immediately available for comment. For the Michelob family of brands, new ads created by Euro RSCG Worldwide highlight the traditional way Anheuser brews the beer, the Journal said, adding the company will spend $30 million on the new campaign. The newspaper also said that Anheuser plans to spend $70 million more than it has this year on ads for Bud Light and Budweiser, its best-selling beers.
