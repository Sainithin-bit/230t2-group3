 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Volkswagen AG ( VOWG.DE ) will decide in the first half of 2008 on building a U.S. plant, the chief executive of the automaker's American operations told Reuters on Monday. 

 Speaking at the Reuters Autos Summit in Detroit, Stefan Jacoby said the automaker will consider the time zone and the availability of a good workforce before narrowing the possible site candidates to three to four U.S. states. Volkswagen, which will sell about 330,000 vehicles in the United States this year, currently does not have a plant in the country. Jacoby also said he plans to increase Volkswagen's U.S. sales to 1 million units by 2018. (For summit blog:  summitnotebook.reuters.com/ ) (Reporting by  Jui Chakravorty ; Editing by  Derek Caney )
