 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. money markets showed increased signs of stress on Monday as year-end factors added pressure to traders already confronting worries over deep housing-related losses in the financial sector. 

 Three-month London interbank offered rates rose for the fourth session, hitting 4.98188 percent, their highest since before the Federal Reserve delivered its latest interest rate cut at the end of October. Dealers said the heightened tensions in the money markets were starting to appear similar to those that arose at the end of the summer, with banks reluctant to lend to each other. Illustrating this, the spread between the bid and ask rates for three-month dollar deposits bounced out to an elevated 15 basis points during Monday's session. "I think it's fear and uncertainty and people unwilling to offer as much credit to the next guy -- and at a Libor it's at a bank level where banks don't want to lend to one another to some extent," said Jeff Hlavacek, director of fixed income trading at BNP Paribas in New York. "That isn't going away into the end of the year because people just have a different mind-set anyway at the end of the year and this is just exacerbating the whole scenario." Dealers traditionally step back from the market as they prepare to close their books at the year-end, which for some comes at the end of November. On August 17, deteriorating market conditions forced the Federal Reserve to deliver a surprise half-percentage-point cut to its discount rate for direct loans to banks. Since then, the Fed has delivered 75 basis points worth of cuts to the benchmark federal funds rate on loans banks charge each other, making similar cuts to the discount rate in tandem. The federal funds target now stands at 4.50 percent. Money market sentiment improved for a time amid the rate cuts but pressures have risen anew with the help of seasonal factors. This year, the usual seasonal factors are making tough market conditions even more difficult due to caution in the wake of the mortgage market meltdown, which has spread fallout through the banking system. Three-month dollar Libor is now on its longest streak of daily increases since early September. It is also at its highest in five weeks relative to the benchmark federal funds rate. Meanwhile, bad news from the financial continues to pour in. Swiss Re RUKN.VX, the world's biggest reinsurer, became the latest casualty of the subprime debt crisis as it revealed a 1.2 billion Swiss franc ($1.07 billion) write-down. "Libor setting was higher and that is going to continue until we get into January, until we get through this and we figure out what the losses are for all this stuff for each of the dealers," said Ted Ake, head of bond trading at Mizuho Securities in New York. "We're still having issues with the subprime story. There are still question marks as to how big the losses are for everyone, and so people are afraid going into year-end to take anyone else's name on their books for December 31 or Nov 30., depending on what your year-end is."
