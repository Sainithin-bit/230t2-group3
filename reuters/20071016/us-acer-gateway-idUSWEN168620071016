 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Computer maker Acer Inc. ( 2353.TW ) Inc. on Tuesday said 86.09 percent of shareholders in Gateway Inc. GTW.N approved Acer's proposed purchase of the company, clearing the way for the merger to close. 

 Taiwan-based Acer in August offered to buy the U.S.-based computer maker for $710 million in a bid to better compete against larger rivals Hewlett-Packard ( HPQ.N ), Dell DELL.O and Lenovo. The merger is expected to be completed today, and Gateway common stock will cease to be traded on the New York Stock Exchange.
