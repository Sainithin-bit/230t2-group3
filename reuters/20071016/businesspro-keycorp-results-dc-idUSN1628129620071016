 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - KeyCorp ( KEY.N ), a large Midwest U.S. 
bank, on Tuesday posted a third-quarter profit that fell short 
of expectations, hurt by a doubling of loan losses and 
volatility in fixed-income markets, and projected 
fourth-quarter profit below the average forecast. 

  Net income for the Cleveland-based company fell 33 percent 
to $210 million, or 54 cents per share, from $312 million, or 
76 cents, a year earlier.  Profit from continuing operations totaled $224 million, or 
57 cents per share. Revenue fell 9 percent to $1.15 billion, 
the bank said.  On that basis, analysts on average had forecast profit of 
71 cents per share on revenue of $1.24 billion, according to 
Reuters Estimates.  KeyCorp also projected fourth-quarter profit of 68 cents to 
74 cents per share. Analysts on average expected 75 cents.  Results were hurt as the bank set aside $69 million for 
loan losses, up from $35 million a year earlier, while net 
charge-offs increased 37 percent to $59 million.  Meanwhile, fixed-income markets suffered what KeyCorp 
called "extraordinary volatility," resulting in $77 million of 
losses from investments, loan sales, writedowns and trading.  "While the fixed income markets continue to remain under 
some pressure as we head into the fourth quarter, we believe 
most of the financial impact on our held-for-sale portfolios is 
behind us," Chief Executive Henry Meyer said in a statement.  Noninterest income slid 19 percent to $438 million, hurt by 
fixed-income volatility, lower investment gains, the sale of 
the McDonald Investments branch network, and a writedown for 
real estate private equity investments.  Lending income fell 2 percent to $712 million. KeyCorp said 
net interest margin fell to 3.40 percent from 3.61 percent, and 
from the second quarter's 3.46 percent, hurt by competition for 
loans and deposits. The bank had earlier this year forecast 
margin staying around the 3.50 percent range.  KeyCorp operates 954 branches, including many in New York 
and the Pacific Northwest. It ended September with $97.4 
billion of assets.  KeyCorp shares closed Monday at $32.35 on the New York 
Stock Exchange. The shares have fallen 15 percent this year, 
compared with a 10 percent drop in the Philadelphia KBW Bank 
Index .BKX.  (Reporting by Jonathan Stempel)
