 STOCKHOLM  (Reuters) - Telecoms equipment maker Ericsson lost a quarter of its market value on Tuesday after reporting a surprise drop in third-quarter profits on the back of weak network upgrade sales. 

 Shares in the world's biggest supplier of mobile networks at one point fell 30 percent, the biggest ever intraday fall, before partly recovering to close at 20.10 Swedish crowns, down 23.8 percent. Ericsson was due to release results next week but rushed them out a day after directors saw them and learned of an unexpected erosion in both profits and margins. The news drove down the Swedish stock market by 4 percent, dented the crown and weighed on the entire European market. "This is a day to be humble, concerned and disappointed," said Ericsson's chief executive, Carl-Henric Svanberg. Ericsson blamed an unfavorable business mix for the deterioration as new networks accounted for a bigger share of its business than before. Within the company's network division, which generates the vast bulk of earnings, new network rollouts are the route to gaining market share and establishing a future base for revenue growth while upgrades and expansions produce higher margins. But new upgrade business can come at short notice. Svanberg said Ericsson did not see an industry shift and it was keeping unchanged its long-term outlook for demand for upgrades. But upgrades in Western Europe and the United States have been delayed lately. He said the company had had 18 quarters of stability, this was one bad quarter and it did not mean the company needed a different organization. Svanberg also said the company could be better at informing the market of developments. "We could have elaborated more on the dynamics and understood the consequences ourselves a bit better," he said. "We have reasons to see if we can get more efficient, and have earlier warnings." DISASTER Ericsson said operating earnings dropped 36 percent to 5.6 billion Swedish crowns ($876 million) from 8.8 billion in the same period last year, on disappointing sales of upgrades and expansions. A Reuters survey of 33 analysts had forecast 8.9 billion crowns in operating earnings. The news landed hard on shares in rivals such as Nokia and Alcatel-Lucent and dragged the entire Swedish stock market down nearly 4 percent. "I think it's a major disaster and unfortunately it's more than a Q3 issue," said Thomas Langer, analyst at West LB, which cut Ericsson to "reduce" from "buy". "My interpretation is that mix of sales in the market is likely to prevail in 2008 -- this is the big, bad news." Only last month Ericsson executives had painted a rosy picture at an investors' conference in London and said the company was poised to grab an even bigger slice of the markets it targets. "This represents a significant change in tone from management, contrasting with the recent commentary of last month's investor day," Cazenove said in a note to clients. It said it was retaining an "underperform" rating on the stock. Tuesday's share price collapse wiped out all the gains from a modest rally since mid-August and sent Ericsson shares to a new low for the year. They started 2007 at 27.70 crowns. Ericsson's previous intraday record fall was a 27.8 percent drop on October 20, 2000 after the tech stocks bubble burst. MARGIN PRESSURES Ericsson's net sales rose 6 percent to 43.5 billion crowns in the third quarter, versus market forecasts for 45.5 billion. Gross margins fell to 35.6 percent from 38.2 percent a year earlier, far short of the 42.5 percent expected by the market. "Ericsson's networks business continues to develop most rapidly in regions where new network rollouts and break-in contracts are predominant," it said. "This is where competition is intense as it builds footprint for long-term profitable growth." The company said margin pressures in these areas to date were offset by higher-margin sales from network expansions and upgrades, but that those had recently dried up. Asia Pacific sales dropped 28 percent to 12 billion crowns from 16.6 billion in the prior three months. Western Europe, narrowly the biggest source of revenue, reported 12.3 billion crowns in sales, down 1 percent from the second quarter. Svanberg described business in China as more a question of invoicing than an underlying problem, saying China would recover significantly in the fourth quarter. Not only is China an increasingly important market for the firm, but also it is a source of more competition and China's unlisted firm Huawei has been making inroads in Europe.
