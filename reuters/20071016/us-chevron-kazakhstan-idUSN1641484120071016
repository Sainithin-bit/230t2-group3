 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - An energy development consortium led by U.S. oil producer Chevron Corp. ( CVX.N ) in Kazakhstan is facing challenges from the Russian government over a pipeline that runs through Russian territory, the Wall Street Journal reported. 

 The $6 billion project is attempting to double capacity at the Caspian Pipeline Consortium, a pipeline which runs from Kazakhstan to the Black Sea, the paper said. But the Russian government, which holds a 24 percent stake in the venture through its state-owned pipeline monopoly OAO Transneft, has blocked the expansion, arguing that Russia should receive more revenue, the paper said. A spokesman for Chevron could not be reached for comment.
