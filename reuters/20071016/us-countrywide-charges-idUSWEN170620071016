 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Countrywide Financial Corp CFC.N, the largest U.S. mortgage lender, said on Tuesday it expects to incur a $125 million to $150 million pretax restructuring charge in connection with its plan to eliminate 10,000 to 12,000 jobs to cope with the U.S. housing slump. 

 In a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing, Countrywide said the charge includes $30 million to $35 million for termination benefits, $73 million to $89 million to end leases, and $22 million to $26 million of other expenses. It expects to realize $57 million of the charge in the quarter ended September 30 and the remainder primarily in the current quarter. It also expects $65 million to $90 million of the total charge to result in future cash outlays. Countrywide on September 7 announced the job cuts, which remain the largest job reduction by a single company stemming from the housing slowdown. It has said it eliminated 4,935 jobs last month, leaving 55,932. The Calabasas, California-based company has struggled with rising delinquencies and foreclosures, and has tightened its lending standards after it had difficulty accessing capital markets. It now makes most of its home loans through its banking unit, which has a wider array of funding sources. Analysts on average expect Countrywide to post a loss of $1.21 per share for the quarter ended September 30, according to Reuters Estimates. The company is scheduled to report results on October 26. Countrywide shares closed down 25 cents at $18.09 on Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange. They have fallen 57 percent this year. (Reporting by Jonathan Stempel)
