 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Brazil's CVRD ( RIO.N ) ( VALE5.SA ), the world's largest iron ore producer, said on Monday that funding its $59 billion five-year investment plan will not be a problem, but it is concerned about rising energy costs and transportation issues in Brazil. 

 The company, whose stock price has doubled and capital market value risen to nearly $160 billion since August, said it will rely on cash flow from selling metal at current prices to finance the plan. "Our investment was limited by physical issues, not financial issues," Chief Executive Officer Roger Agnelli said at a press briefing at the New York Stock Exchange. "We could have gone beyond $11 billion in 2008." Last week, CVRD said it plans to spend $59 billion in 2008-2012 to more than double output of copper, expand production of iron ore and nickel and develop aluminum production. It earmarked $11 billion for the first year of the five-year period. "Our 2008 investment was not limited by a financial element, but by technical, engineering or equipment and some labor issues and also the issue of approvals for environmental permits," Agnelli said. He said infrastructure, such as roads and power, was a major issue in some new mining projects and much of the investment would be to improve logistics at ports and roads. Also problematic are high energy costs in Brazil, he said. "Brazil needs to generate more energy. Its hydroelectric potential has not been used." For example, Agnelli said Brazil has enormous reserves of bauxite, the chief ore of aluminum, but aluminum smelters require large amounts of electricity, which is a stumbling block for the company there. "We're looking at South America and Africa that would justify an aluminum project," he said. Hydroelectric power is most likely the cheapest source of energy in Brazil, but CVRD is also looking at gas to cut costs. "We need to find a cheap source of energy to build a smelter." But the investment in new lower cost mines, coupled with automation and efficiency improvements, will allow the company to reduce its production costs back to 2004 levels, Agnelli said. "Our aim is to go back to the cost level of 2004. We reached peak last year, and we are already reducing that a little," Agnelli said. Agnelli said $2.8 billion, or five percent of the $59 billion, would go towards environmental protection. The company spent $375 million this year for "environmental responsibility" and in 2008, will spend $475 million, Agnelli said. "There is a need for investing in infrastructure, but also in the communities where we operate, such as hospitals and public management." Asked if CVRD was betting on continued industrial growth in China, he said: "We believe that China's growth will be very strong and India is not far behind. Prospects are good for continued growth." CVRD estimates China's share of global iron ore consumption will increase from 45 percent last year to 54 percent in 2011. Nickel consumption will rise from 17.3 percent to 31 percent, aluminum from 25.5 percent to 41 percent and copper from 21 percent to 30 percent, the company said. Agnelli declined to speculate on the new iron ore price set to be negotiated this year, citing "some distortions" as a result of freight increases. He said the market would correct itself in the next months, "(but) it is too early to talk of negotiations, we have to have a clearer vision of the price." The price of iron ore, a key raw material for steel-making, rose 71.5 percent in 2005, 19.0 percent in 2006 and 9.5 percent for this year. As several projects come online in 2008 the company's cash flow will increase, he said. The ratio of debt to earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortization should actually fall in the next few years. CVRD's current net debt level is about $19 billion. Meanwhile, CVRD may continue to tap international capital markets to improve its debt profile, which currently has an average cost of less than 7.0 percent and an average maturity of about 10 years. It may also get official sources of financing, with low interest rates. "That is not necessary, but we have been talking to multilateral financing agencies in China, Japan, Germany, Brazil and Canada to get long-term financing for those investment projects," Agnelli said.
