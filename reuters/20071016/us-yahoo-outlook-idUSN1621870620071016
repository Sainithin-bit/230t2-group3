 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Yahoo Inc ( YHOO.O ) said on Tuesday it would focus on strengthening its position as a broad-based Internet advertising outlet, aiming to capture more of what is expected to be a $75 billion market in 2010. 

 "Our mandate now is to marshal our substantial strengths to drive growth," Yahoo Chief Executive Jerry Yang said on a conference call with analysts. Wall Street has been waiting for details of a 100-day strategic review that Yahoo began in July. (Reporting by  Eric Auchard  and  Michele Gershberg , editing by Jeffrey Benkoe)
