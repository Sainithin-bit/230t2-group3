 SEOUL  (Reuters) - Standard & Poor's expects the Federal Reserve to further trim U.S. interest rates in December or January as the world's largest economy keeps slowing, the ratings agency's chief economist said on Tuesday. 

 David Wyss told reporters in Seoul that the Federal Reserve would probably cut the federal funds rate by a quarter of a percentage point in December or January 2008 after it had cut the key rate by half a percentage point in September.
