 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A federal judge has granted class action status for lawsuits filed in 36 states by current and former FedEx Corp ground and home delivery drivers, an attorney for the drivers said on Monday. 

 The move by Judge Robert Miller of the U.S. District Court for Northern Indiana covers about 14,000 current drivers and as many as 10,000 former drivers, according to a statement released by the Leonard Carder law firm. FedEx Ground, the company's ground delivery unit, said it plans to ask the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals to review the decision. The lawsuits claim that the control FedEx Ground exercises over its contractors makes them employees, with a right to benefits and a refund for buying their trucks. The International Brotherhood of Teamsters also is trying to unionize FedEx Ground drivers. FedEx Ground pays some employees as independent contractors. Under that system, drivers can own multiple routes, employing other drivers to deliver packages. FedEx has said the drivers are independent contractors.
