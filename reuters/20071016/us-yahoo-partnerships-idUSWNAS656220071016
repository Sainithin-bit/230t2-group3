 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Yahoo Inc ( YHOO.O ) said on Tuesday the company has set deals with automotive, health and news sites to cross-sell advertising to customers they share, marking the latest advances in a partnership strategy. 

 Seeking to show its progress in reaching new audiences off Yahoo's own network of Internet media properties, the Sunnyvale, California-based company said it had reached deals with WebMD Health Corp ( WBMD.O ), Cars.com, Forbes.com and Ziff- Davis-Media. In the broadest of the deals, Yahoo said it has an exclusive, multi-year Web search and advertising distribution deal with WebMD and its network of consumer health sites. WebMD will be the only major health publisher to be able to cross- sell advertising from Yahoo customers on its own site. Online ad spending is expected to top $1 billion in 2008, according to a recent study by market research firm eMarketer. The company said it is working with the remaining three partners -- Cars.com, Forbes.com and Ziff-Davis -- that will allow Yahoo to sell display advertising on those sites and for the sales forces of these partners to sell ads on Yahoo.
