 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Delta Air Lines Inc ( DAL.N ), which emerged from bankruptcy at the end of April, posted higher-than-expected quarterly profit on Tuesday, boosted by international flights and tighter cost controls. 

 The earnings from Delta, the first major U.S. carrier to report on its third-quarter performance, indicated that the industry's recovery from a long slump is intact despite soaring fuel prices and signs the U.S. economy is slowing. The strength of Delta's international operations bodes well for other network carriers such as UAL Corp's UAUA.O United Airlines. "I'm assuming now that some of the others may come in a little bit better than expected -- particularly the ones that have big Pacific operations like United and Northwest," said Calyon Securities analyst Ray Neidl. The No. 3 U.S. carrier by passenger traffic said net profit quadrupled to $220 million, or 56 cents per share, compared with $52 million in the same period a year ago, when the company's shares were unlisted. The earnings beat Wall Street expectations of 41 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. "They've done an exceptionally good job (controlling costs and growing revenue in a competitive market)," Calyon's Neidl said. The figures are the first for Delta with Richard Anderson as chief executive. Anderson, who was previously CEO at Northwest Airlines Corp NWA.N, took over the top job at Delta in September, replacing Gerald Grinstein, who retired. Operating revenue rose 10 percent to $5.2 billion, boosted by strong growth on routes to Latin America and across the Atlantic. Revenue per available seat mile, or unit revenue, rose 12.6 percent to Latin America and 8.5 percent across the Atlantic. Domestic U.S. unit revenue rose 6.3 percent. Delta's revenue growth well outpaced a 4 percent rise in operating costs, while interest expenses dropped 41 percent as the company paid off more than $1 billion in debt in the quarter. Delta, like many other U.S. network carriers, is shifting capacity to lucrative international routes and away from the hard-fought domestic market. Delta plans to continue the trend, saying it will pull 13 planes from its domestic fleet. The company forecast a decline in mainline domestic capacity, as measured by available seat miles, by 1 percent to 3 percent in the fourth quarter. It plans to increase international capacity by 12 percent to 14 percent. Delta expects costs per available seat mile, or unit costs, to decrease 5 percent to 7 percent, excluding fuel and profit sharing expenses, in the fourth quarter. But the airline is highly exposed to changes in the fuel price. Delta has hedged just 20 percent of its expected fourth-quarter fuel needs at an average cap of $2.35 a gallon. Delta's post-bankruptcy shares, which were listed on the New York Stock Exchange in May, fell 23 cents to $19.73 in early trading, although the entire market is feeling the pressure from rallying oil prices.
