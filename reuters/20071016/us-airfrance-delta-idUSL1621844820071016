 PARIS  (Reuters) - Air France-KLM ( AIRF.PA ) and Delta Air Lines Inc ( DAL.N ) will team up on routes linking major U.S. cities and London's Heathrow airport in a direct challenge to rival British Airways Plc BAY.L. 

 With a view to the Open Skies pact set to liberalize transatlantic rules next March, the two airlines will form a joint venture, said analysts who attended an Air France investor conference on Monday. "The opportunity that we have with Air France across the transatlantic could create a very powerful entity," Delta Chief Executive Richard Anderson said on a conference call. Combining Delta's U.S. presence with Air France's Europe position "could create an enormous amount of value," he said, declining to comment on details. Air France declined to comment ahead of a formal announcement set for Wednesday. The two carriers hope to extend their cooperation to include Northwest Airlines Corp NWA.N and Continental Airlines Inc CAL.N once they win multi-party, anti-trust immunity. The aim is to tap into sprawling U.S. domestic networks held by the three U.S. carriers, and link these with Europe's busiest airport. Big corporate customer accounts held by the three U.S. carriers will help fill seats and could mean a loss of lucrative business class customers for British Airways, analysts said. Business travelers crossing the north Atlantic are BA's biggest source of profits. A spokeswoman said BA said the airline was confident it was ready for Open Skies: "We have the best schedule between London and the United States and we're not afraid of new competition." Analysts said Air France plans a new direct route from Heathrow to Los Angeles and would use Heathrow slots to serve nine U.S. destinations. Air France KLM Chief Executive Jean-Cyril Spinetta was quoted in two analyst notes telling investors the deal with Delta would add "several dozens of million euros" in profits in 2008. Incremental profits from the venture will be shared. Analysts said Air France KLM also reiterated its profit targets at Monday's presentation, which was closed to the media. The Delta joint venture is expected to be modeled on a 10- year-old agreement between Northwest and KLM, the Dutch airline that is part of the Air France group. "Air France-KLM has clearly decided to seize the new opportunities offered by the Open Skies agreement, especially for traffic departing from London Heathrow," Paris brokerage Oddo said in a note to clients. For decades, U.S. access to Heathrow has been limited to two U.S. and two UK airlines -- currently American Airlines AMR.N and United Airlines UAUA.O, along with BA and Virgin Atlantic Airways VA.UL. Air France KLM shares fell 2.4 percent to 26.56 euros on Tuesday while BA ended down 1.4 percent at 413-3/4 pence.
