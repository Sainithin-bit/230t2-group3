 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Yahoo Inc ( YHOO.O ) said on Tuesday its roll-out of a key advertising technology to clients was nearly complete on a global basis and it had seen an acceleration of display ad growth in the third quarter. 

 "I'm very pleased to say our global roll-out of Panama is nearing completion," Yahoo President Susan Decker said on a conference call with analysts. "Substantially all of our global advertisers have now been migrated to the new system." Decker said the company's revenue from graphical display advertising, such as banner ads, grew more rapidly at a nearly 20 percent rate in the third quarter after nearly 5 quarters of decelerating growth.
