 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - D.R. Horton Inc ( DHI.N ), the largest U.S. home builder, said on Tuesday quarterly net orders for new homes plunged 39 percent and cancellations spiked as the U.S. housing market continued to deteriorate. 

 The Fort Worth, Texas-based company, whose shares were down 2.8 percent in early afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange, said it expects tough selling conditions to persist as banks impose stricter lending standards. D.R. Horton said net orders for its fiscal fourth quarter that ended September 30 fell to 6,374 from 10,430 a year earlier. The value of the orders dropped 48 percent to $1.3 billion from $2.5 billion. "The 48 percent year over year decline in orders is very weak, especially considering it is off of an easy comparison with last year's fourth quarter orders down 33 percent," Wachovia analyst Carl Reichardt wrote in a research note. Prospective buyers canceled outstanding orders at a rate of 48 percent during the quarter, up from 40 percent a year ago. D.R. Horton plans to release fourth-quarter results on November 20 before the market opens. Wall Street analysts on average expect the company to report a profit of 4 cents per share before charges and one-time items, down from 88 cents a year earlier, according to Reuters Estimates. The U.S. housing market has been suffering from a steep downturn as high prices and climbing interest rates have shut out some buyers. Defaults on mortgages made to those with weak credit have exacerbated the problem with recently tightened lending standards also affecting prospective buyers with good credit scores. "Buyers continued to approach the home-buying decision cautiously," D.R. Horton Chairman Donald Horton said in a statement. "We expect the housing environment to remain challenging." To weather the downturn, home builders are cutting back construction, reducing land holdings and payroll, while looking to generating cash to pay down debt. Home builders have been discounting and holding special sales to move homes already built but without buyers. On September 29, D.R. Horton auctioned off 53 homes to close out two developments the San Diego area. D.R. Horton has been among the most aggressive price cutters but orders still fell as buyers remained sidelined. Horton's California region was particularly hard hit with the number of orders falling 58 percent and with the value of the orders declining 74 percent. Despite the conditions, D.R. Horton was able to reach its goal of generating $1 billion in cash flow from operations for fiscal 2007. U.S. government data on housing starts for September is set for release on Wednesday, and analysts polled by Reuters said they expect starts to sink further from the 12-year low set in August. In July, when D.R. Horton posted its first-ever quarterly loss as a public company, it took a charge of nearly $1.28 billion, partly for a write-down on the value of projects in California, Las Vegas and other once-hot residential markets. Charges of that size have become less of a rarity. Centex Corp ( CTX.N ), the No. 4 U.S. home builder, has said it will set aside about $1 billion for a myriad of write-downs, impairments, forfeited option deposits and provision for loan losses in its financial services unit. "Given the severe deterioration experienced in August/September, we forecast (D.R. Horton) pretax impairments of $900 million for the fiscal fourth quarter 2007," UBS analyst David Goldberg wrote in a research note. Wachovia's Reichardt put the figure at about $1.27 billion for impairments and write-offs in the fiscal fourth quarter. D.R. Horton shares were off 38 cents at $13.20 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. They are down about 50 percent so far this year, roughly in line with the 51 percent drop in the Dow Jones U.S. Home Builders index  .DJUSHB.
