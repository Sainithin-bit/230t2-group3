 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - International Business Machines Corp ( IBM.N ), the world's largest technology services company, reported higher quarterly earnings on Tuesday. 

 Intel Corp ( INTC.O ) posted a 43 percent increase in quarterly profit, helped by higher sales of notebook personal computer microprocessors and its restructuring efforts. Yahoo was set to report earnings later on Tuesday. IBM ( IBM.N ) Story: <ID:nWNAS6545> Intel ( INTC.O ) Story: <ID:nWNAS6549> COMMENTARY: IBM SHAW WU, ANALYST, AMERICAN TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH, HAS A BUY  RATING ON IBM "It looks like the services business was better than expected. Both hardware and software was a little light, but services made up for that. Bookings at $11.8 billion came in at the high end of expectations." "Overall results were in line. They came in a penny better than consensus. Some people were expecting better, including us at $1.70, but results were still in line. They were not outstanding but were not a miss." RICHARD SICHEL, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, The PHILADELPHIA  TRUST CO "From what I can see, it looks like the earnings came through about as expected. Revenues were a bit better and I think the upside is sales in the service area continue to grow. I think that's key." "I did see the stock immediately sold down a point or so. I think it takes a little time to sort out IBM's earnings."
