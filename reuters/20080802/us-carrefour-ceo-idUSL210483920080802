 PARIS  (Reuters) - French supermarket chain Carrefour ( CARR.PA ) denied on Saturday that it had hired headhunters to seek a replacement for Jose Luis Duran, its chief executive. 

 The Financial Times quoted an unnamed prominent businessman as saying he had been approached by a headhunter before a July 28 shareholder meeting called to approve a simplification in the management structure. A spokesman for the board of the world's second-biggest retailer said: "The board of Carrefour denies having hired a headhunting firm to replace Jose Luis Duran, whom it has just named chief executive following the July 28 shareholder meeting." Carrefour used to have a supervisory board, headed by Amaury de Seze, and a management board, headed by Duran. Under the new structure there is a single board of directors, whose chairman is De Seze and of which Duran is not a member. (Reporting by Estelle Shirbon; Editing by Ron Askew)
