 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - General Motors GM.UL set final terms for a landmark public offering on Wednesday to repay a controversial taxpayer-funded bailout of the automaker and cut the U.S. Treasury to a minority shareholder. 

 The stock will trade on the New York Stock Exchange and Toronto Stock Exchange beginning later on Thursday. A snapshot follows of how the stakes of various parties will be whittled down after the IPO and the challenges that loom ahead. * GM COMMON STOCK OUTSTANDING AFTER IPO: 1.5 billion shares following a 3-for-1 stock split. * IPO PLANS: GM plans to sell 478 million common shares at $32 to $33 each, raising about $15.5 billion at the midpoint. * TREASURY STAKE: Treasury plans to sell 358.5 million GM shares in the IPO, cutting its stake to 36.9 percent from 60.8 percent. Treasury's stake would drop to 33.3 percent if the underwriters exercise their option to buy additional shares. * CANADA STAKE: Canada plans to sell 30.5 million GM shares, cutting its stake from 11.67 percent to 9.6 percent. The stake could drop to 9.3 percent if the underwriters exercise their over-allotment options in full. * UNITED AUTO WORKERS VEBA STAKE: The UAW retiree healthcare trust, commonly referred to as a VEBA, plans to sell 89 million GM shares, which could take its 19.93 percent total stake, including warrants, down to 14.17 percent. The trust's stake could drop to 13.30 percent if the underwriters fully exercise their options to buy additional shares. (Reporting by  Soyoung Kim ; editing by  Andre Grenon )
