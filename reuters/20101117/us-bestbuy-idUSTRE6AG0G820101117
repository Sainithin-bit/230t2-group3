 HUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif. Nov 16 Reuters - Consumers might delay this year's holiday shopping until the last minute because of the sluggish economy, the head of consumer electronics retailer Best Buy Co Inc ( BBY.N ) said. 

 Brian Dunn, the chief executive officer of Best Buy, also said he expects strong sales for e-readers, smartphones, tablet computers such as the Apple Inc ( AAPL.O ) iPad, and gaming products like Microsoft Corp's ( MSFT.O ) Kinect and Sony Corp's ( 6758.T ) Playstation Move. "I think it's (holiday spending) going to be exciting, but I think it will be late this year," Dunn told Reuters on the sidelines of an Intel Corp ( INTC.O ) investor event. He said the slow economy was still affecting consumers. "I think people will sort of take a just-in-time approach to it," he said on Tuesday. Best Buy will offer free shipping this holiday season, he said, following the lead of Wal-Mart Stores Inc ( WMT.N ). "I think they got the jump on us by a little bit, but you know what -- I think it's a great year to be a consumer because there are going to be great values in the marketplace." The National Retail Federation, a trade group, forecast a 2.3 percent increase in sales in November and December, compared with a 0.4 percent increase in 2009 and the 3.9 percent decline in 2008.
