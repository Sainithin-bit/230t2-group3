 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Republicans will block any Democratic deal on extending Bush-era tax cuts if rates for the middle class and wealthy are not extended in tandem and on the same terms, a top Republican in the U.S. Senate said on Wednesday. 

 "Are you kidding, of course we would," said Senator Orrin Hatch, who sits on the tax-writing Senate Finance Committee and is expected to be the panel's top Republican in January. The sparring between Democrats and Republicans over the future of the tax cuts enacted under former President George W. Bush, which are due to expire on December 31, will have an impact on virtually everyone's tax bills. It also is one of the first skirmishes in the 2012 U.S. presidential race, as both parties calculate how to engineer a temporary tax extension for maximum advantage as the campaigns for the White House reach their climax in two years. Hatch was responding to a deal floated by the White House and some Democrats in which lower rates would be extended for the first $200,000 of income on a permanent basis, while tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans would be renewed for a shorter period. The parties are divided on how to deal with the top tax rates paid by the wealthiest 2 percent of Americans. Republicans appeared to harden their positions while Democrats scrambled for a strategy to prevent all taxpayers from facing higher tax rates on January 1 -- the result if Congress fails to renew the Bush-era legislation. A meeting between President Barack Obama and congressional leaders set for Thursday has been rescheduled to November 30. The White House said Republicans asked to postpone the meeting because of scheduling conflicts. Some Republicans' aides had grumbled that Obama proposed the November 18 meeting without first consulting their bosses. A lobbyist on tax issues said the delay reflected Republican boldness in telling the president they could not fit him into their schedule. Democratic Senator Maria Cantwell said the postponed meeting further pushes back any decision. "We have to figure out what the Republicans are willing to do in a lame duck session; we don't have 60 votes," Cantwell said. "We can't just do it by ourselves." DEMOCRATS REGROUP Democrats are still trying to regroup after their big election losses. With Nancy Pelosi winning election on Wednesday as minority leader in the next Congress, Democrats have retained a liberal voice who has been an advocate of ending the tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans. On Wednesday, White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said there is resolve to settle the debate over tax cuts by year-end. "There is a strong impetus to get something done by the end of the year," he told reporters. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid on Tuesday said he would be willing to consider a multi-year tax cut extension for all income levels, despite his personal opposition. "This is something we will take a look at," Reid said. Still, Senator Max Baucus, the Democratic chairman of the finance committee, said the caucus has not reached a consensus. "I believe that middle-income taxpayers should get their tax (cuts) extended, not the upper brackets," he said. "That's what I'm working for." Many Democrats want a vote on extension for the middle-class-and-under rates, to call Republicans' bluff. Senator Dianne Feinstein, a California Democrat, said it was not clear Democrats are resigned to a temporary extension for the wealthiest Americans. "The economy has been very good to the well-to-do and there are all kinds of indications that people in the upper 1 and 2 percent are doing very well," Feinstein said. Republicans are not united on some key issues. For example, a senior House of Representatives Republican earlier this week said he could back extending jobless benefits, a key concern of Democrats, in exchange for an extension of all the Bush-era tax cuts, including for the wealthiest. Benefits for nearly 1 million jobless expire on November 30. But another senior Republican, Senator Judd Gregg, threw cold water on that idea on Wednesday. "The tax cuts are separate from the jobless benefits issue ... we've got to be careful here. We don't want to institutionalize the incentive not to get a job," Gregg told Reuters Insider. Senator Evan Bayh, a retiring Democrat who would like all the tax cuts extended, predicted a down-to-the-wire drama. "I'm betting December 21, 22nd," Bayh said. "Difficult things, complex things, rarely get done absent an unavoidable deadline. Christmas is one of those." (Editing by Leslie Adler)
