 LONDON  (Reuters) - BP's ( BP.L ) board will tighten its oversight of the oil group's day-to-day operations following the Gulf of Mexico oil spill, its chairman was quoted as saying on Wednesday. 

 "We will have a higher degree of disclosure and a higher degree of discussion going forward than we have seen in the past between the executive and the board," Carl-Henric Svanberg in an interview with the Financial Times. Svanberg said he and Bob Dudley, who took over as chief executive from Tony Hayward in October, were "eager to see if the board can be even more effective." "We need to ensure that the checks and balances remain good with strong oversight and disclosure, particularly in safety," said Svanberg, who was appointed chairman in January. He said he had formed an early impression "coming from the outside... how much was delegated to the executive" at BP. (Reporting by Karolina Tagaris)
