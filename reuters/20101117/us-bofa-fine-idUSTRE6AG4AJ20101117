 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Massachusetts' top securities regulator has fined Bank of America Corp $100,000 after finding two of the firm's financial advisers misled investors in a bond sale. 

 John Keating and Reggie Aquino sold Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac step-up bonds, assuring at least one client that they carried a government guarantee, said William Galvin, Massachusetts secretary of state, in a statement. The client subsequently bought $2 million in the step-up bonds, which have interest rates that increase over time and are not guaranteed by the government. After the regulator began investigating the client got his money back, said Galvin. Keating and Aquino worked for Banc of America Investment Services (BAI) in Hingham, Massachusetts. BAI has since been incorporated into Bank of America's Merrill Lynch brokerage unit. The regulator also sent an order to Bank of America setting out a compliance training program for all of its former BAI advisers who now work for Merrill Lynch in Massachusetts. In addition to training, a tenth of these advisers will be subject to a test where they will have to explain the details and risks of similar bonds to a mock "client." The regulator has also ordered Keating be subject to heightened supervision, with his orders reviewed daily. Aquino is no longer with the firm, said Galvin. "We are pleased to resolve this matter," said a Bank of America spokesman. (Reporting by Helen Kearney; editing by  Andre Grenon )
