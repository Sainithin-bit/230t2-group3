 MONTGOMERY, Alabama  (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve's latest push to drive down borrowing costs is aimed at supporting the U.S. economic recovery, not weakening the dollar, Atlanta Fed President Dennis Lockhart said on Tuesday. 

 The central bank's decision earlier this month to pump an additional $600 billion into the financial system has drawn sharp criticism from overseas officials, who see the measure as a thinly veiled effort to boost U.S. exports via a softer currency. "There is no monetary policy intent to engineer specific values -- or even a direction-- for the dollar," Lockhart said in a speech before the Alabama World Affairs Council. "This policy was not undertaken to prompt dollar depreciation." Lockhart, in the latest in a string of public remarks by Fed officials defending the new policy, said a strong U.S. economy and stable prices are the best way to ensure the dollar retains its long-run worth. Given that backdrop, Lockhart said the Fed would most likely see the full $600 billion program to buy government bonds through its announced June completion. "The working assumption should be that we will in all probability complete the program in the eight months that it's been designed for," he said. Still, Lockhart added that he would not completely rule out a mid-course reevaluation if economic growth proved much stronger than expected. STAVING OFF DEFLATION Lockhart said the new drive to lower borrowing costs was aimed at reducing the risk of deflation and supporting a recovery that remains too sluggish to put a dent in the U.S. unemployment rate, which has hovered near 9.6 percent for several months. After emerging from the deepest recession since the Great Depression last summer, the U.S. economy has grown unevenly, registering a modest 2 percent annualized rate of expansion in the third quarter. "The current policy is resolutely designed to support the expansion of the economy and to maintain inflation near the (Fed's) desired objective for price stability," Lockhart said. The Fed has stated that it would like to see inflation running around 2 percent or a bit below. Consumer price readings have been coming in well below that, raising fears of a deflationary spiral of falling prices and wages that would weigh on the economy. Lockhart said the risk of such an outcome had decreased recently, according to market measures of inflation expectations, and he credited the Fed's well-telegraphed move for the shift. "This policy has already shown some signs of success by altering inflation expectations and reducing the risk of unwanted disinflation," Lockhart said. He argued that inflation was an easier challenge for policy makers to deal with than deflation. Domestic critics of the Fed's new bond-purchasing policy, known as quantitative easing in financial markets, see it as possibly sowing the seeds of future inflation. Two U.S. Republican lawmakers said on Tuesday the Fed should focus solely on inflation and ditch its "dual mandate" to promote both price stability and full employment. Lockhart, who said it was too early to comment on such a proposal, cautioned that Americans should not expect too much from policy, which he said can only help buttress demand in an environment that remains difficult.
