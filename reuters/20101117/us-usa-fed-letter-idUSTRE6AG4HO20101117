 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve's bond-buying program may imperil the dollar, spawn inflation and generate asset price bubbles, top Republican lawmakers said in a letter to Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke released on Wednesday. 

 The Fed's $600 billion quantitative easing program "introduces significant uncertainty regarding the future strength of the dollar and could result both in hard-to-control, long-term inflation and potentially generate artificial asset bubbles that could cause further economic disruptions," the Republican leaders of the House of Representatives and Senate wrote.
