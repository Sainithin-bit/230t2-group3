 ST. LOUIS  (Reuters) - A top Federal Reserve official said on Wednesday the central bank is likely to follow through on its entire $600 billion bond buying program based on an anticipated weak economic recovery. 

 "As the forecast looks right now it looks like we'll be purchasing at this pace through the end of the second quarter to add up to $600 billion," St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank President James Bullard told reporters on the sidelines of a conference. Data showing muted inflation for October is a concern and justifies the Fed's actions to stimulate the economy, Bullard said. The 12-month rise in the underlying consumer price index was a record low 0.6 percent last month, the government said earlier in the day. "That's a low number and continues the disinflation trend that we've seen in 2010," he said. "That disinflation trend is something that I'm worried about and I think we should take action to turn around; that's part of the reason I supported the second round of quantitative easing," he added.
