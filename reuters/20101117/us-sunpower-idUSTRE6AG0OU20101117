 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - The bureaucracy that came with overseeing a large company spurred SunPower SPWRA.O chairman T.J. Rodgers to quit and return to his start-up roots, the outgoing company official told Reuters on Tuesday. 

 Rodgers, who is also chief executive of Cypress Semiconductor ( CY.O ), told the board of the solar developer in a meeting last week that he intended to resign after his term expires next year. "I am ready to return to my start-up roots," Rodgers wrote in a follow-up letter to the board. He said he couldn't provide Reuters with a copy of the letter because he wrote it on the spot with ballpoint pen on stationery from the Rosewood Hotel on Silicon Valley's Sand Hill Road after company executives asked for written notice. "When you go into the board, you're dealing with committees and formalities," Rodgers said in a phone interview, adding he got plenty of that at Cypress. "I don't need a second dose." Directors at SunPower "work their butts off," he said. "And it's not work that interests me." Rodgers enjoyed his duties more when SunPower, now a company with $2 billion in annual revenue, was smaller and his expertise in technology and manufacturing was crucial, he said. "SunPower would not be where we are today without TJ," chief executive Tom Werner told Reuters. "We thank him for his incredible support and guidance." RODGERS, THE ADVOCATE In the recent U.S. mid-term elections, Rodgers was an advocate of California's Proposition 23, which would have rolled back California's landmark environmental laws. SunPower, a leader in solar energy, directly benefits from those laws. Rodgers called the law a "job-killing tax" in an editorial last month in the Wall Street Journal. He said he informed the company about the editorial before it ran. "I got a minor amount of flak from people within SunPower" about the editorial, Rodgers said. He said no one asked him to step down. "It's hard to ask the chairman to pipe down. They said, 'We're going to have a difference of opinion,' and I said, 'I guess so.' " Rodgers' position "probably sat a little awkward with people at SunPower," said Ramesh Misra, an analyst at Brigantine Advisors. "It creates a little bit of a conflict of interest." Rodgers was an early investor in SunPower, which has offices near Cypress Semiconductor in Silicon Valley. But now that Sunpower has matured, "there are few synergies between Cypress and SunPower," said Misra, who added the resignation would have little impact on day-to-day operations at the company. Cypress first invested in SunPower in 2002, a year after Rodgers' personal investment, and SunPower eventually became a Cypress subsidiary. SunPower held an initial public offering in 2005, with Cypress spinning out its remaining SunPower shares in 2008. Rodgers owns about 51,000, or 0.09 percent, of the company's outstanding shares. SunPower's shares closed down 4.46 percent at $13.50 Tuesday. (Reporting by Sarah McBride; Editing by  Bernard Orr )
