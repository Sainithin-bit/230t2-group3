 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. airlines are projected to post $4 billion in profits for 2010, the chairman of newly formed United Continental Holdings Inc ( UAL.N ) said on Wednesday 

 Speaking to an industry group in Washington, Glenn Tilton also said that United Continental needs a "tremendous amount of deleveraging" and it may be time to make balance sheets more resilient industrywide. "I think with these interest rates, everybody is focused on opportunities to refinance debt," Tilton said. "It's a timely thing." Still, he said airlines "have come a long way" since the early and middle part of the last decade when United and other major carriers fell into bankruptcy. He said the industry is trying to make itself more appealing to Wall Street as a long-term investment. United/Continental was formed this year from a $3.17 billion merger of UAL Corp and Continental Airlines with the goal of delivering $1 billion to $1.2 billion in annual cost and revenue benefits by 2013. The combined company has about $9 billion in cash, which exceeds its market capitalization by nearly $400 million. The airline industry has been hit in recent years by overcapacity and an economic recession that drained travel demand. But carriers are beginning to recover, posting strong profits in the third quarter. U.S. carriers lost $2.5 billion last year. United shares were up 16 cents at $27.34 on the New York Stock Exchange. The Arca airline index  .XAL  was up 0.58 percent. Tilton said debt reduction, as well as U.S. progress on global trade initiatives, modernizing aviation infrastructure and simplifying industry taxes and regulation are priorities for helping industry achieve "our ambition of sustained profitability." He pointed to merged United, the new Delta Air Lines Inc( DAL.N ) formed through its merger with Northwest and Southwest Airlines Co ( LUV.N ) growing through acquisition as healthy changes that successfully addressed overcapacity and can drive new profits. "A lot of things are happening in the industry that bode well for its financial well being," Tilton added. (Reporting by  John Crawley ; editing by  Andre Grenon )
