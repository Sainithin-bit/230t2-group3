 BANGKOK  (Reuters) - Japanese camera maker Nikon ( 7731.T ) laid off 1,500 staff at its Thai plants, the latest move by global firms seeking to cut costs amid weak sales due to the global financial crisis, the Bangkok Post said on Saturday. 

 Nikon (Thailand) Co. decided to terminate the employment of the workers on Friday because it had received far fewer orders from the United States, Japan and Canada, the newspaper said. "All the dismissed workers are under subcontracts and have worked with the company for less than a year," it quoted Pongthai Musikapong, of the Labour Protection and Welfare Office in Ayutthaya, as saying. Company executives had promised severance pay for all the staff and the firm's labor union would call on the Labour Ministry to immediately help find work for those who had lost their jobs, the English-language paper said. Nikon's Thai unit, set up in 1990, has 8,000 permanent employees and 4,000 subcontracting staff at its four factories in Ayutthaya, 48 miles north of Bangkok, the paper said. Nikon's job cuts in Thailand followed other international companies seeking to stave off the impact of a slump in sales due to deepening economic gloom. On Thursday, U.S. car giant General Motors Corp ( GM.N ) announced a two-month shutdown at its Thai plant, and Toyota Motor Corp ( 7203.T ) said it planned production cuts in Thailand. Most of the world's major automakers have plants in Thailand, which produced 1.29 million vehicles last year, of which 690,000 units were exported worldwide. A Federation of Thai Industries survey of 200 large factories in the central province of Ayutthaya found 30 were mulling cutting production or jobs, the Bangkok Post reported. Another 79 firms had frozen their staff levels, it said. (Reporting by Orathai Sriring; Editing by Peter Blackburn)
