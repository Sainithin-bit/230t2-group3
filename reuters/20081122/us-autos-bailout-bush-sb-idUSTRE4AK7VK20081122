 LIMA  (Reuters) - President George W. Bush urged Congress on Friday to give struggling automakers access to $25 billion in already appropriated technology funds if they show they want to restructure. 

 "If the automakers are willing to make the hard decisions needed to become viable, they should be able to receive the funds Congress already allotted to them for other purposes," Bush said in his weekly radio address to be broadcast on Saturday. "This is a critical issue for our economy and our country. The American people expect their elected leaders to do what it takes to solve it," Bush said, according a transcript of his speech released by the White House.
