 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - International Lease Finance Corp, the plane-leasing business owned by insurer American International Group ( AIG.N ), will be sold to a group of investors and ILFC's management, Bloomberg reported on Saturday. 

 ILFC founder and Chief Executive Steven Udvar-Hazy told the news agency in an interview that the deal would close early next year. ILFC, one of the biggest buyers of planes from Boeing Co ( BA.N ) and Airbus ( EAD.PA ), did not immediately return a call seeking comment. AIG, which suffered major losses on mortgage derivatives, is selling assets to repay a loan from the Federal Reserve. The outlook for ILFC has been clouded for months by the predicament of AIG. The plane lessor relied on AIG's blue-chip credit rating for access to capital to buy planes. But when AIG's rating took a hit in September, ILFC was locked out of the debt market. Bloomberg cited Udvar-Hazy as suggesting the unit had a value of about $10 billion. But the investors were not identified. (Reporting by Kyle Peterson; Editing by  Xavier Briand )
