 ROME  (Reuters) - European Central Bank Governing Council member Mario Draghi met the leader of Italy's main opposition party on Thursday to discuss the economy and the government austerity plans, a source in the opposition Democratic Party said. 

 Draghi, the Governor of the Bank of Italy, met Democratic Party leader Pier Luigi Bersani on Thursday morning, before a vote in the Senate to approve the austerity plan, which the opposition has promised not to block. The meeting between the two comes amid widespread calls for national unity to confront the threat of a debt crisis which could suck in Italy, the euro zone's third largest economy.
