 LONDON  (Reuters) - JPMorgan has picked one of its top European corporate advisers, Larry Slaughter, as co-head of investment banking for North America, replacing Jeff Urwin who now runs the business globally. 

 Slaughter will move to New York at the end of the third quarter from London, where he has been head of corporates for Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA), according to an internal memo seen by Reuters. A spokeswoman for the U.S. bank confirmed the appointment. Slaughter, who has been with JPMorgan in London for nearly 20 years, has advised on a series of high profile deals, and previously helped run the European mergers and acquisitions business. He worked with private equity firms such as Kohlberg Kravis and Roberts (KKR), advising it on its acquisition of Alliance Boots in 2007 -- still the biggest leveraged buy-out in Europe -- and also focused at one stage on industrial companies. Slaughter's move comes after Urwin was promoted last month to a new role overseeing global investment banking industry groups, capital markets and mergers and acquisitions. Slaughter will work alongside Kevin Willsey, who was already co-head of North American investment banking. JPMorgan, the second-largest bank in the United States, was the top-ranked bank in terms of global investment banking fees in the first half of this year, according to Thomson Reuters and Freeman Consulting data. By advisory mandates on announced mergers and acquisitions worldwide, it came third behind Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, Thomson Reuters data showed. JPMorgan ranked second for announced U.S. deals and third in EMEA. The bank posted a higher-than-expected jump in second-quarter profit on Thursday, even though bond trading in the investment bank unit declined.
