 ATHENS  (Reuters) - Greece announced a deal with the European Union on Thursday to allow for 14 billion euros to be made available to the debt-laden country through EU funds in a bid to raise badly needed investment in its infrastructure. 

 "The piggybank of the National Strategic Reference Framework will now be at the disposal of the real economy, businesses, workers and saving the country," Greece's Development Minister Mihalis Chrysohoidis said in a statement. The Greek government said the new package would save 1.4 billion euros in state funds through 2013. This would be achieved by increasing the EU's co-financing rate for projects to 85 percent, it added. (Reporting by  Greg Roumeliotis )
