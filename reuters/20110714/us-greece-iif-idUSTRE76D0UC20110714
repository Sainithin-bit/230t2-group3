 ROME  (Reuters) - The Institute of International Finance (IIF) will hold a meeting on Greek debt in Rome on Thursday with creditor banks and Vittorio Grilli, chairman of the EU's Economic and Financial Committee, a source close to the meeting said. 

 A similar meeting was held in Rome on July 7. The banks are struggling to strike a deal which would let private sector creditors provide cash and breathing space to Greek debtors without being defined as a default by credit rating agencies. (Reporting by  Stefano Bernabei )
