 STOCKHOLM  (Reuters) - Swedish regulators have raided leading local bourse operator Nasdaq OMX Group ( NDAQ.O ) in a competition probe sparked by a complaint from a small local rival, officials said on Thursday. 

 The raid was carried out last month and was prompted by a complaint filed by new marketplace Burgundy about the actions of U.S. telecoms company Verizon ( VZ.N ). The competition authority expanded its probe to include Nasdaq OMX, according to court documents. "We are cooperating fully with the authorities," said a Nasdaq OMX spokesman in Stockholm. Burgundy chief executive Olof Neiglick told Reuters his company had reached an agreement in 2010 to house its servers in a data center owned by Verizon, which also houses the Nasdaq OMX servers and those of major clients like banks. He said Verizon later canceled the agreement. A spokeswoman for the Competition Authority confirmed a raid had taken place. Court documents said: "KKV (the competition authority) wishes to investigate whether OMX has applied pressure on Verizon or threatened to punish Verizon if Verizon concludes an agreement with a competitor to OMX. "According to the KKV, OMX and Verizon's actions mean that Burgundy risks being shut of the market in bourse trade with Nordic securities," the document said.
