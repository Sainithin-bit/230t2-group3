 ATHENS  (Reuters) - Greece welcomes the fact that its European partners realize the need for a comprehensive solution to its debt problem, Prime Minister George Papandreou said on Thursday. 

 "It is positive that in recent days our partners in Europe are discussing increasingly, and pressing for, comprehensive solutions," he told a cabinet meeting. "They see that... it is not a Greek problem, or simply a problem of the periphery, but a wider structural problem for the future of European countries." He said the coming days were critical and negotiations needed to be carried out with a cool head. (Reporting by George Georgiopoulos; Editing by  Greg Roumeliotis )
