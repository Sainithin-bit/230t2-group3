 (Reuters) - U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke told Congress this week he is ready to ease monetary policy further if economic growth and inflation slow. 

 The central bank has already cut interest rates to near zero and last month completed a $600 billion round of bond-buying designed to lower borrowing costs still further. QE2, so called because it was the second round of the Fed's 'quantitative easing', brought the Fed's total purchases of long-term assets since the Great Recession to $2.3 trillion. Asked whether the Fed would be willing to launch another bond purchase program if the economy slumps, Bernanke said on Wednesday: "We have to keep all the options on the table. We don't know where the economy is going to go." Bernanke listed several potential easing options, some of which he also included in a more detailed speech last August. The ideas have risks and costs, he said, but "prudent planning requires that we evaluate the efficacy of these and other potential alternatives for deploying additional stimulus if conditions warrant." In a 2002 talk Bernanke offered several additional ideas for preventing Japan-like deflation, although these may have been overtaken by events, observers say. Here is a look at the ideas Bernanke outlined in the speeches. JULY 2011 SPEECH/ AUGUST 2010 SPEECH ( here ) ( here ) -- BOND BUYS New purchases of long-term Treasury assets is seen as a possibility. The Fed believes its two rounds of bond-buying have held longer-term interest rates down and encouraged investors to move into riskier assets, helping drive the stock market higher. The Fed could also increase the average maturity of its securities holdings, Bernanke said in July, presumably by buying bonds with longer maturities than in its first two rounds of quantitative easing, which were concentrated in mid-range maturities such as five- and seven-year notes. By focusing on longer-dated bonds, officials would presumably place additional downward pressure on long-term market interest rates. Arguing against more bond buying is the harsh criticism domestic and international critics leveled at the Fed over its most recent buying binge. Perhaps more pressing, Bernanke in June cited risks from inflation as a concern. Bernanke has also said that expanding the Fed's balance sheet -- which has ballooned to more than $2.8 trillion from its pre-crisis size of around $900 billion -- risks undermining confidence in the Fed's ability to keep inflation in check when the recovery does accelerate. -- BOLSTER EASY POLICY ASSURANCES The Fed has already promised to hold benchmark rates unusually low for an extended period. It could bolster that commitment by pledging to hold rates near zero until a specific date beyond the time frame currently expected by markets. In his most recent speech, Bernanke said the U.S. central bank could also provide explicit guidance on how long it will keep its balance sheet at its current record size. Some analysts think even milder communications tweaks could help. For example, a Fed commitment to continue reinvesting maturing securities for an extended period could deliver some additional punch, JPMorgan economist Michael Feroli said. -- LOWER THE INTEREST RATE ON EXCESS BANK RESERVES The Fed could lower the 0.25 percent interest rate it currently pays banks on excess reserves held at the Fed. Doing so could encourage banks to put those reserves to use by lending them out. But Bernanke has said the likely impact of moving this already low rate even lower would be marginal. -- RAISE THE FED'S INFLATION TARGET By temporarily setting a target for inflation above what the Fed considers consistent with long-term price stability, the central bank would again be communicating to markets that any tightening of monetary policy is far off. However, Bernanke made clear this was highly controversial even within the Fed and is an unlikely course of action. He did not mention this possibility in his most recent speech. NOVEMBER 2002 SPEECH ( here ) -- TARGET A YIELD ON A PARTICULAR SECURITY Under this plan, the central bank would announce explicit ceilings for yields on longer-maturity debt. To defend the target it would have to stand ready to purchase whatever it would take of whichever security it was targeting. However, the idea of yield targeting has fallen from favor at the Fed because the central bank would have to surrender control over its already massive balance sheet. Further, in an eventual recovery, the Fed would be committing to buying securities at a specific yield even as prices fell. MOVE TO LOWER YIELDS ON PRIVATE DEBT The Fed could, through its discount window, make three- or six-month loans to banks against a wide range of collateral such as corporate bonds, commercial paper, or mortgages. Such a program would lower rates on these instruments. -- BUY FOREIGN GOVERNMENT DEBT; DEVALUE THE DOLLAR Purchasing foreign sovereign debt might weaken the dollar against other currencies, among other things. Bernanke took pains to say in 2002 that he was not recommending this option.
