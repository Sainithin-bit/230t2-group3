 LONDON, Jul  (Reuters) - Regulators need to decide whether Rupert Murdoch's News International business is fit to run television stations in Britain after the furor over phone hacking at one its newspapers, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said on Thursday. 

 "Clearly there are big questions about the fitness and properness of News International and that is exactly why (communications regulator) OFCOM are now looking at it," Clegg told BBC Radio 4. "The thing that I think isn't quite clear to me at least is exactly how fit and proper tests are applied," he added. News International is the UK arm of News Corp. News Corp on Wednesday shelved a bid to take full control of pay TV operator BSkyB because of a backlash over abuses at its newspaper arm. (Reporting by  Keith Weir )
