 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - There is no alternative to raising the debt ceiling, and "heinous choices" about which bills would have to be paid first in the event of a default are a matter of due diligence, the White House said on Wednesday. 

 "It's not solving the problem, it's dealing with the consequences of a catastrophic decision," White House spokesman Jay Carney said, referring to the idea of prioritizing payments should Congress not raise the debt ceiling by August 2. "There is no alternative. You either honor your obligations or you don't, and if you don't you make terrible choices about what bills you pay," he said. Carney repeated the White House does not believe the United States will default on its debt. (Reporting by  Jeff Mason  and  Laura MacInnis , ; Editing by  Sandra Maler )
