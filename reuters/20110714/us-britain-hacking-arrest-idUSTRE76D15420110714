 LONDON  (Reuters) - Britain's senior police chief came under fire on Thursday after his force said a former News of the World deputy editor, arrested by officers investigating phone hacking by the paper's reporters, had been hired as a consultant by the police. 

 Paul Stephenson, London's police commissioner, was summoned for a 90-minute meeting with the city's mayor after the capital's force said it had employed the journalist between October 2009 and September 2010. The disclosure was an embarrassment for a police force facing questions about its links to tabloid reporters and prompted Home Secretary (interior minister) Theresa May to write to Stephenson asking for an explanation. Lawmaker Keith Vaz, the head of a parliamentary committee investigating the police's failure to properly probe phone hacking in 2006, asked Stephenson to appear before his committee next week and said the police chief had agreed to attend. Neil Wallis, 60, was arrested in London on suspicion of conspiring to intercept communications. He is the ninth person to be arrested since an inquiry was reopened this year into phone hacking at News of the World newspaper, part of Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. London mayor Boris Johnson said he had a "very frank discussion" with Stephenson over the hiring of Wallis. Police are investigating allegations journalists on the paper hacked the phones of members of the royal family, politicians and celebrities, as well as victims of crime, including child murders, and the 2005 London bombings. The scandal dates back to 2005-6 when the News of the World's royal reporter Clive Goodman and a private detective were arrested and later jailed for snooping on the voicemail messages of royal aides. Police are also investigating claims police officers were bribed by journalists to provide information. Last week, detectives arrested the paper's former editor Andy Coulson, who went on to become Prime Minister David Cameron's media chief before resigning in January. Wallis was the deputy editor under Coulson until he quit following the conviction of Goodman, and went on to become the paper's executive editor before leaving in 2009. The Metropolitan Police said Wallis had worked for them as an advisor for almost a year and was paid 24,000 pounds ($39,000). "Chamy Media, owned by Neil Wallis, former Executive Editor of the News of the World, was appointed to provide strategic communication advice and support to the MPS, including advice on speech writing and PR activity," it said. Wallis worked for the Met for two days a month while the Met's Deputy Director of Public Affairs was on extended sick leave. In April, the paper's chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck, one of its senior reporters James Weatherup, and Ian Edmondson, a former senior editor who was sacked after an internal inquiry into his conduct, were quizzed about listening to voicemails. The officer leading the inquiry told lawmakers on Tuesday those arrested so far had been bailed until October and she did not expect any possible criminal charges before then.
