 (Reuters) - German media tycoon Leo Kirch has died at age 84, his family said in a statement on Thursday. 

 Following are five facts about Kirch: - Kirch was a media entrepreneur who owned Germany's first private TV channel, Sat.1 and helped build the country's largest commercial broadcaster ProSiebenSat.1. He suffered from diabetes, which left him almost blind for more than 25 years and resulted in the loss of a foot. - Born on Oct 21, 1926 in the small Bavarian village of Volkach, Kirch, the son of a vintner, studied business administration and mathematics in Munich. The devout catholic, who shunned public appearances and avoided the press, was a close friend of former German chancellor Helmut Kohl. - Kirch started his company in 1956 when he bought the rights for Federico Fellini's "La Strada" with 25,000 German marks (then worth about $6,000) borrowed from his wife. His media empire eventually spanned television broadcasting, Formula One rights and publishing. - Kirch's downfall was a disastrous, cash-bleeding venture into pay-TV company Premiere. It led to the collapse of his TV empire in 2002. Ever since, Kirch has been embattled in law suits with Deutsche Bank, claiming comments by Deutsche's former chairman, Rolf Breuer, on the broadcasting group's financial health in a TV interview had undermined confidence in the Kirch group's creditworthiness. - In October 2007, Kirch looked set to make a comeback on the German media scene when the German soccer league DFL hired Kirch's Sirius agency to arrange the next two auctions for Bundesliga media rights in German-speaking countries. The deal was canceled almost a year later after a dispute with German anti-trust authorities. (Compiled by Nicola Leske; Editing by Jon Loades-Carter)
