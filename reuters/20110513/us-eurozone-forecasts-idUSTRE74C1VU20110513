 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - The euro zone economy will grow 1.6 percent this year with inflation well above the European Central Bank's target, but the aggregated budget deficit will fall more than previously thought, the European Commission said. 

 In its twice-yearly economic forecast the European Union executive kept its forecast of 1.6 percent growth in 2011, first made in February, and raised its inflation forecast for this year to 2.6 percent from the 2.2 percent projected in February. "The main message in our forecast is that the economic recovery in Europe is solid and continues, despite recent external turbulence and tensions in the sovereign debt market," Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn said. The Commission said the overall budget deficit of the 17 countries using the euro would shrink to 4.3 percent of gross domestic product this year from 6.0 percent in 2010, rather than to 4.6 percent from 6.3 percent as forecast last November. Next year, the overall euro zone government deficit will fall further to 3.5 percent of GDP rather than 3.9 percent as forecast in November. "Public deficits are clearly declining. It is now essential to strengthen these trends of growth and consolidation and also ensure that they translate into more and better jobs," Rehn said. "This calls for continued fiscal consolidation and determined implementation of structural reforms that help job creation and improve the competitiveness of our economies," he said. But the Commission also forecast that unless policies changed, Greece, which is struggling to put its public finances in order under a joint EU and IMF bailout program, would miss its deficit and debt targets this year and next. The Commission forecast that without policy shifts, Greece would have a budget deficit of 9.5 percent of GDP this year and 9.3 percent in 2012, rather than the 7.6 percent and 6.5 percent respectively envisaged in the EU/IMF program. Greek debt would rise to 157.7 percent of gross domestic product this year and to 166.1 percent in 2012, rather than be 145.2 and 148.8 percent as under the EU/IMF plan targets. Ireland, also under an EU/IMF program would be broadly on track with its fiscal deficit adjustment, the Commission said. (Reporting by  Jan Strupczewski , editing by Luke Baker)
