 (Reuters) - The euro zone economy accelerated in the first quarter of 2011, expanding by 0.8 percent, data showed on Friday. Following are reactions by economists to the figures. 

 ECONOMISTS' COMMENTS CHIARA CORSA, UNICREDIT "We had 0.6 percent as our official forecast, but we already pointed out we saw some upside risk. "The numbers are pretty good. We suspect we had a nice rebound in investment. In Q4, we had a drag on construction due to bad weather, so we expect we saw a technical rebound. "Consumption probably contributed well to GDP growth. Momentum is quite healthy, with some exceptions though Greece too rose by 0.8 percent in the quarter, which is good news, actually a bit surprising to us. "The strong performance overall was driven by France and Germany. Italy was a bit disappointing. "We are expecting 1.7 percent growth for 2011, but this might have to be revised a bit upwards. We pencil in a deceleration going into the second quarter, even if still at a healthy pace. "We were already betting on the ECB going forward with its interest rate cycle and these numbers strengthen the case." JUERGEN MICHELS, CITIGROUP "It's even a bit stronger than we expected. We had a forecast of 0.7, but given the stronger-than-expected data out of Germany France and the Netherlands this morning it's not a huge surprise. "There may be temporary factors distorting the first quarter or the upside may be coming from weather effects and I think the data continues to show quite a large discrepancy between strong performing core countries and weak periphery. "There is a surprising increase in the Greek data in the first quarter, but have in mind there was a massive downward revision of the fourth quarter, so there is probably some short-term volatility involved. "The next rate rise is likely to take place in July. The ECB is likely to go ahead with further rate hikes in the next couple of quarters, so this figure overall supports the ECB in its aim to go ahead with withdrawing the monetary stimulus. We expect a rate at 2.25 at the end of the first half of next year." CARSTEN BRZESKI, ING "Excellent. We see strong momentum in the euro zone, mainly driven by core countries. What is promising from what we see here is that Greece all of a sudden showed some growth for the first time in how many quarters, and Spain continued to grow. "Bad news is that Portugal is still lagging. But overall very good news. "We will clearly see more rate hikes in the rest of the year. Clearly the April hike was more than justified and we will see at least two more this year. This is clear food for hawks at the ECB. "Consumer recovery continued at least in the core countries but I have doubts growth came from consumption in the periphery countries." BERND WEIDENSTEINER, COMMERZBANK "All the bigger economies of Europe, with the single exception of Italy, are in relatively good shape. The next interest rate hike from the ECB will only happen in July in our view. An early June rate hike is unlikely."
