 BERLIN  (Reuters) - The German government is in "very close contact" with coalition members of parliament on further debt bailouts for euro zone partners and is confident of majority support on this, a spokesman said on Friday. 

 "We have very intense contact with coalition MPs and contact on the difficult issue of stabilizing the euro zone is especially close," spokesman Steffen Seibert told a news conference. "Despite what you read in the papers there is a lot of support for government policy in the coalition." (Reporting by  Stephen Brown  and  Annika Breidthardt )
