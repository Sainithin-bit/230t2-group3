 ST GALLEN, Switzerland  (Reuters) - BP ( BP.L ) chief executive Bob Dudley said on Friday talks were ongoing about its planned share swap with Russian group Rosneft ( ROSN.MM ) and he was optimistic about a resolution. 

 "I think there is always lots of discussion going on and I think we will find a resolution to this over time," Dudley told Reuters in at interview on the sidelines of a conference in St Gallen. The $18 billion share swap agreement expires on Monday, with some analysts believing the deadline to complete the swap, which was previously blocked by a court injunction, could be extended.
