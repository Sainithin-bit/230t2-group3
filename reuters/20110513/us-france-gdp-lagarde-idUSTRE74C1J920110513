 PARIS  (Reuters) - France's 1.0 percent GDP increase in the first quarter supports the government forecast of 2.0 percent growth in gross domestic product for 2011, finance minister Christine Lagarde said on Friday. 

 She made the comment in a statement after official statistics office data showing GDP rose a forecast-topping 1.0 percent in the first three months of the year compared to the last three months of 2010.
