 OSLO  (Reuters) - Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou said on Friday that Europe must stick with its single currency and stop a "blame game" that is preventing progress on issues from finance to unemployment. 

 "We are looking for scapegoats, we are playing a blame game," he told a meeting of center-left politicians in Oslo. "We are saying the North is to be blamed, the periphery is to be blamed, the migrants are to be blamed. Obviously this is incapacitating Europe, we are losing the potential we have." He said that Europe has no choice but to defend its monetary union even amid skepticism from the financial markets and media. "There is no going back on the euro, yet we are not moving forward enough either," Papandreou said. "Even the IMF today is saying that our (Greek) debt is sustainable, we can manage our debt without restructuring. However, the markets are pounding us incessantly, the media are predicting a doomsday, and this is promoting a culture of fear." (Reporting by Oslo newsroom)
