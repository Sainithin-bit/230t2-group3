 MILAN  (Reuters) - Italian refiners Saras ( SRS.MI ) and Erg ( ERG.MI ) warned that a  protracted Libyan crisis and high oil prices could threaten the recovery in margins that is expected for the rest of the year. 

 Saras said on Friday that recovering refining margins had helped boost its first quarter results, and it and peer Erg said margins should continue to improve for the rest of the year, depending in part on what happens in Libya and to crude prices. Meanwhile, analysts have said European refiners will be forced to cut oil processing within weeks, as a downturn in U.S. gasoline prices eats further into profits trimmed by expensive crude and weak gas oil prices. Saras said its comparable core earnings for the first quarter were 154 million euros ($218.6 million) compared to a forecast provided by the company of 66 million euros. "The EBITDA number is a big beat, even after adjusting for certain one-offs. The refining margins are better than expected and the Sarroch refinery seemed to be running on all cylinders in the quarter," Jeffries oil & gas analyst Dan Ekstein said. At 0903 GMT (4:03 a.m. EST), Saras shares were up 6.09 percent at 1.776 euros while the STOXX Europe 600 Oil and Gas index .SXEP was up 0.33 percent. Erg shares were up 0.36 percent at 9.865 euros. Saras, Italy's No. 3 refiner, said a quick resolution to the Libyan crisis would boost refining margins. Saras is normally a big buyer of Libyan crude, with some 35 percent to 40 percent of supplies coming from the North African country. HIGH OIL PRICES Erg, Italy's No. 2 refiner, said on Friday its net loss in the first quarter doubled from a year ago due to a scheduled shutdown for maintenance at its main ISAB refinery in Sicily. "For the remainder of 2011 we are expecting results that are in overall improvement thanks to a gradual recovery in the refining margins," Erg Chief Executive Alessandro Garrone said in a statement. Erg, which expects refining results in 2011 to be in line with 2010, warned the sector could be hit by the Libya crisis as well as the persistence of high crude prices of over $120 per barrel which would dampen overall oil demand. "The Erg results were as poor as expected. And in any case the equity story is very much the put option on its Sicily refinery," a Milan analyst said. Erg runs the ISAB refinery with Russia's Lukoil ( LKOH.MM ). The agreement between the two, signed in 2008, included a put option on Erg's stake to be exercised within four years in one or more installments, no more than once every 12 months. Refineries in Europe have been closing down parts of their operations because of the global economic crisis and competition from Asia and the Middle East.
