 BRUSSELS  May 13 (Reuters) - Banks that need to raise fresh capital after stress tests should turn to investors rather than governments, European Union finance ministers will say next week, according to a draft document seen by Reuters on Friday. 

 "Should the stress test reveal a capital need, private-sector solutions will be preferred," officials write in the document, which outlines the position EU ministers are set to take when they gather. "The use of public funds will be available only as a last resort, in case of need and subject to strict conditionality." The document also says that banks that are judged too weak in the current round of stress tests will have up to six months to address their problems and may get longer if market conditions are hostile. "Any institution concerned will be allowed a period of three months from the publication of the results to present clear plans to address vulnerabilities and a maximum of six months, i.e. until end of November 2011, to implement the necessary remedies (with flexibility allowed only if justified by market conditions or required procedures)."
