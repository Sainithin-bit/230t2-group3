 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The two mortgage lending giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have not availed themselves of any of the lifelines the U.S. government and Federal Reserve have offered, the White House said on Monday. 

 "As far as I know, neither of the companies have gone forward to take advantage of any of the borrowing opportunities," White House spokeswoman Dana Perino told reporters. "Both of their regulators have stated that the companies are well-capitalized." (Reporting by  Jeremy Pelofsky , Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)
