 FARNBOROUGH  (Reuters) - Etihad Airways ordered 100 planes worth over $20 billion from Airbus and Boeing as Gulf carriers ruled a slower-than-normal opening day at the Farnborough Airshow. 

 Farnborough started more quietly than past events as record high fuel prices, tight credit and slowing economies have squeezed airlines and hurt ticket demand. Following are orders that have been announced so far: ** Etihad said it was buying 25 Airbus ( EAD.PA ) wide-body A350 aircraft, 10 A380 superjumbos and 20 single-aisle A320 planes in a transaction worth $11 billion at list prices. Etihad also ordered 35 Boeing ( BA.N ) 787 Dreamliners and 10 Boeing 777s, in a deal Boeing said was worth $9.4 billion. ** Boeing said FlyDubai ordered 50 single-aisle 737 airliners, in a deal worth $4 billion at list prices. Start-up lowcost carrier FlyDubai is also taking four 737s from lessor Babcock & Brown. ** Airbus said state-owned Saudi Arabian Airlines SAUD.UL ordered eight 295-seat twin-engine Airbus A330-300s, a deal worth $1.6 billion at list prices for the wide-body aircraft. ** Brazil's Embraer ( EMBR3.SA ) ( ERJ.N ) unveiled orders for 22 of its 190 aircraft and options on 20 more: Aeromexico orders 12 190 aircraft and takes 15 options; Saudi low-cost carrier orders five 190 aircraft; and Niki Lauda's Niki orders five 190 aircraft with five options. ** Russian plane maker Sukhoi's director-general said he expects to announce around 30 orders for its new Superjet 100, and customers will be both Russian and non-Russian.
