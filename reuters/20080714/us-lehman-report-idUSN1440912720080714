 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Lehman Brothers' LEH.N executives, seeking to shore up the brokerage's share price, is mulling options including a strategic alliance with a partner, the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday. 

 The investment bank is also considering a form of share buyback or an asset sale, the newspaper said, citing people familiar with the matter. Over the weekend, Lehman executives participated in conference calls with senior members of the U.S. Federal Reserve and the Securities and Exchange Commission on the situation facing the firm. Lehman shares plunged to nine-year lows on Friday amid concern that the mortgage market's woes would hurt its fixed income business. The investment bank has lost about a third of its market value over the past two weeks and has been the focus of some rumors that later turned out to be false. SEC staff members are expected to visit the firm's midtown Manhattan offices on Monday, a person familiar with the matter told the WSJ. Lehman Brothers spokeswoman Kerrie Cohen declined to comment.
