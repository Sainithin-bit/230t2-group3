 FARNBOROUGH  (Reuters) - Regional plane maker ATR, a joint venture between EADS ( EAD.PA ) and Finmeccanica ( SIFI.MI ), confirmed its 2008 turnover would top $1.3 billion and said it was planning a new turboprop aircraft. 

 "Despite the softening market trends affecting the commercial aviation market in the first half of the year, ATR expects...to reach a turnover of more than $1.3 billion and over 60 aircraft sold," Chief Executive Stphane Mayer told reporters at the Farnborough airshow. Mayer also said the turboprop planemaker was planning to build a new aircraft able to seat between 90 and 100 passengers, but declined to give further detail. Toulouse-based ATR said it had secured eight firm orders for the ATR 42-500 and ATR 72-500 booked in the first semester of 2008 and predicted it would deliver 60 by the end of the year, up on last year's 44. ATR said it would look to cut costs going ahead but ruled out reducing the company's headcount. (Reporting by  Rhys Jones  and Matthias Blamont, Editing by Dan Lalor)
