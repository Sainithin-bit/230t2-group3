 FARNBOROUGH  (Reuters) - Brazil's Embraer ( EMBR3.SA ) ( ERJ.N ), the world's third-biggest aircraft maker, reported 22 firm orders for its 190 executive jet, as airlines opted for smaller and more efficient planes. 

 Aeromexico, traditionally a large passenger carrier, ordered a dozen of the Embraer's 100-seater jets with the option to buy another 15, while Saudi Arabia's NASair upped its order to ten planes from five. Austrian entrepreneur and former Grand Prix racing driver Niki Lauda also bought five for his low-cost Niki airline and has options for five more. "The main task facing airlines today is the quest for efficiency," said Mauro Kern Junior, Embraer's executive vice-president for the airline market. "E-jets are more economic and more environmentally friendly." Embraer, one of Brazil's largest exporters, has been investing heavily in private planes since 2002 in a bid to diversify its revenue base. (Reporting by Chloe Fussell, Editing by Dan Lalor)
