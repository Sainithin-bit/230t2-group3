 DETROIT  (Reuters) - General Motors will cut white-collar jobs, including engineering positions in North America, as part of its latest restructuring to be announced on Tuesday, people briefed on the plans said on Monday. 

 The top U.S. automaker said it would announce steps to cut costs in response to a slump in sales and a costly shift away from trucks and SUVs by American consumers in response to high gas prices. GM Chief Executive Rick Wagoner is scheduled to detail those plans for investors and employees on Tuesday morning. GM has already announced plans to close four truck plants in North America that employ some 100,000 workers. The white-collar job cuts to be announced on Tuesday will reflect a shift in emphasis away from developing and marketing trucks and SUVs, one person familiar with the matter said. Some GM managers had been told to be ready for job cuts under the latest restructuring as of last week, another person said. (Reporting by  Kevin Krolicki )
