 NEW YORK/PHILADELPHIA  (Reuters) - The $52 billion takeover deal for Anheuser-Busch Cos Inc. ( BUD.N ) is a nice boost for M&A bankers, who have been suffering from a sharp downturn in deal volume this year. 

 The takeover ranks as the largest all-cash transaction, eclipsing AT&T's ( T.N ) 2004 takeover of Cingular Wireless for $41 billion. Banks typically take a total 1 percent to 2 percent advisory fee from deals. In a multibillion-dollar deal the percentage typically drops to the lower end of the scale. With M&A volume about 40 percent lower than a year ago, according to Thomson Reuters data, advising on the Anhueser-Busch deal was a welcome payout for the banks but it did not change the top reaches of the world mergers and acquisitions rankings, dominated by the usual suspects. The banks advising Anheuser-Busch on the deal were top-ranked Goldman Sachs ( GS.N ), second-ranked Citigroup Global Capital Markets ( C.N ) and Moelis & Co. Advising the buyer, Belgium-based InBev NV INTB.BR, were third-ranked JPMorgan Chase & Co ( JPM.N ), Lazard Ltd ( LAZ.N ), Deutsche Bank AG ( DBKGn.DE ) and BNP Paribas SA ( BNPP.PA ). The deal was a particular boost for Lazard, pushing it up the M&A worldwide advisory rankings to No. 10 from 12 last year, according to Thomson Reuters data. The deal ranks as Lazard's fifth-biggest financial advisory assignment. It was also a boost for Moelis & Co, pushing it back into the top 15. Moelis had been ranked in the top 15 earlier this year with its role advising Yahoo Inc ( YHOO.O ) on the proposed merger offer from Microsoft Corp ( MSFT.O ) but lost league table credit when the deal was officially withdrawn.
