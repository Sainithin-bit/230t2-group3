 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - M&T Bank Corp ( MTB.N ), a large U.S. mid-Atlantic regional bank, on Monday said second-quarter profit fell 25 percent, hurt by rising credit losses tied to residential real estate. 

 Net income for the Buffalo, New York-based company, whose largest investors include Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc ( BRKa.N ) ( BRKb.N ), fell to $160.3 million, or $1.44 per share, from $214.2 million, or $1.95, a year earlier. M&T said net operating earnings fell 24 percent to $170.4 million, or $1.53 per share. (Reporting by Jonathan Stempel; Editing by Gerald E. McCormick)
