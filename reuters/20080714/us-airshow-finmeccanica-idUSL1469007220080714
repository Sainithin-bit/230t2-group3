 FARNBOROUGH  (Reuters) - Italian defense and aerospace group Finmeccanica ( SIFI.MI ) confirmed plans to raise additional capital on the equity markets and said it aims to achieve an operating profit margin of 10 percent by 2010. 

 Chairman and CEO Pier Francesco Guarguaglini said the company hoped to raise 1.4 billion euros ($2.2 billion) through the equity markets. In a separate statement on Monday, the group said the funds would be used for "business development" purposes. In May, Finmeccanica unveiled its $3.94 million purchase of U.S. defense company DRS Technologies Inc DRS.N. The Italian company said it planned to launch the capital hike by the end of its current financial year, though the board has until July 2009 to carry it out. "At the moment we are firm and disciplined in our stance but are hopeful a deal with DRS can be finalized soon," Guarguaglini told reporters. Finmeccanic, which is partnered with Thales ( TCFP.PA ) in the space industry, added it hoped to achieve an EBIT (earnings before interest and tax) margin of 10 percent by 2010. The company's 2007 margin was 8.1 percent. (Reporting by  Rhys Jones  and Matthias Blamont, Editing by Dan Lalor) ($1 = 0.6365 euro)
