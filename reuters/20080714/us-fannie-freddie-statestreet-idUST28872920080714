 HONG KONG  (Reuters) - State Street Global Advisors (SSgA), one of the biggest fund managers in the world, has no plan to cut its debt holdings in U.S. mortgage finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. 

 The U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve announced sweeping measures on Sunday to lend money and buy equity if necessary in Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, government-sponsored enterprises owned by shareholders. The plan was unveiled in an effort to calm investors after the stocks of both firms plummeted more than 40 percent last week on fears the companies, pillars of the housing market, were undercapitalized. Ramon Maronilla, portfolio manager with the $2 trillion money management unit of State Street Corp, said the two firms had several options for propping up their capital adequacy ratios and liquidity was not a problem for either company. "It's not just that they are too big to fail, it's that they are too important to fail," he told Reuters in an interview. "For us, the bottom line is we are not selling, we are holding on to this debt." He declined to reveal how much of SSgA's holdings were made up by debt issued by the two mortgage firms. Hong Kong-based Maronilla said the viability of the two companies was crucial because any disruption to their normal operations would exacerbate the U.S. housing downturn and send ripples throughout global capital markets. Fannie and Freddie own or guarantee $5 trillion of debt, close to half the value of all U.S. mortgages. Foreign central banks, mostly in Asia, hold $979 billion of the bonds and mortgage-backed bonds sold by the agencies. Washington's intervention came after the collapse last week of mortgage lender IndyMac Bancorp Inc, which was been seized by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp (FDIC) following a run on the bank, in which panicked customers withdrew more than $1.3 billion of deposits in 11 business days. "This is another blow to market confidence. It's really about market uncertainty," Maronilla said. But Maronilla said money supply was not a worry at Fannie and Freddie, and the problem lay elsewhere. "The issue right now is about capital adequacy and not about liquidity," he said, adding there were several options open to the two mortgage giants for enhancing capital. He said possibilities included issuing capital privately or by selling equity or preferred stock to the U.S. government, or by allowing the government to take over their obligations. Another route could be access to a large U.S. government loan or repurchase line, he said. Even if liquidity became a problem to Fannie or Freddie, Maronilla said, the two could rely on the strength of their holdings. "Liquidity is not an issue right now, but in the worst case scenario both could pledge their massive mortgage portfolios to the Federal government for funding," he said. (Editing by Neil Fullick)
