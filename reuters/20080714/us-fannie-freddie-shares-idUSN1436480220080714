 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Shares of mortgage finance firms Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac could not hold the gains they made early on Monday as questions remained over what the U.S. government's sweeping rescue plan means for shareholders. 

 Fannie's and Freddie's shares initially soared after the U.S. government and central bank said on Sunday they would lend money to Fannie and Freddie and buy their equity if needed to rescue the two pillars of the U.S. housing market. But the gains soon fizzled as analysts and investors noted any direct government investment in Fannie Mae FNM.N and Freddie Mac FRE.N would further dilute existing shares -- the last thing investors want, especially given the spectacular drops in the shares in the past year. Demand for Freddie Mac's routine $3 billion bill sale on Monday morning, the first test of the company's borrowing ability after the government outlined its rescue plan, was stronger than a similar sale last week. But the news appeared to pressure shares further. "Markets are in effect agreeing that the debt is money good but the value of the equity is still in question," said Bret Barker, portfolio manager, Metropolitan West Asset Management, Los Angeles. Shares of Fannie and Freddie were hammered last week on concerns that they may buckle under losses as the housing downturn drags on and their ability to raise capital has been severely hampered. Bond investors would be in a better position than stock holders, because of a widely held belief that the fixed-income securities Fannie and Freddie guarantee are backed by the government. So while the Freddie Mac auction "seemed to go OK," said Andrew Brenner, analyst at MF Global Inc. in New York, "there is still a tremendous amount of cynicism out there when it comes to financials." Despite assurances from the government that the two companies will remain shareholder-owned, there are still concerns about the value of these shares, said Kurt Brunner, portfolio manager, Swarthmore Group in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Bottom line is the market is in no mood to give anyone any benefit of the doubt right now, said Peter Kenny, managing director at Knight Equity Markets in Jersey City, New Jersey. "It's nice to know that the government is willing to take unorthodox steps to calm the markets to infuse confidence in the part of the investors, but this is a long road ahead of us here." Fannie Mae's shares rose as much as 30 percent in trading before the opening bell. They traded lower on the NYSE immediately after the auction, before turning higher to be up 4.8 percent at $10.79. The story was similar for shares of Freddie Mac, whose shares were trading up 3 percent at $7.99 in midmorning.
