 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The debt securities of mortgage finance companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will outperform U.S. government bonds over the next six months, said PIMCO, the company that manages the world's biggest bond fund, on Monday. 

 Yield spreads of the so-called agency debt of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac "are clearly going to tighten and outperform Treasuries in the next six months," said Paul McCulley, managing director of Pacific Investment Management Co., speaking on CNBC television.
