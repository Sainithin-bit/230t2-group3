 PHILADELPHIA  (Reuters) - Grupo Modelo, which is 50-percent owned by Anheuser-Busch Cos Inc, has yet to bless the U.S. brewer's planned takeover by InBev NV, but the Mexico brewer has little leverage to block the deal, sources familiar with the situation said on Sunday. 

 Anheuser agreed to be acquired by InBev for $50 billion, sources said on Sunday, creating the world's largest beer maker. Anheuser and InBev declined to comment. Modelo has no power to veto that transaction, but it is expected to assert it has the right to accept or decline InBev as its future partner, one source familiar with the situation said. Modelo had been in talks with both companies for separate deals, including Anheuser potentially buying the rest of Modelo it did not already own, sources said. InBev also had been in talks with Modelo for a possible commercial deal, sources said. InBev, however, preferred the larger transaction with Anheuser and lured the maker of Budweiser to the bargaining table last week by raising its bid to $70 per share, up from $65 per share. The boards of both companies approved the deal on Sunday, sources said. Modelo and InBev plan to continue discussions to smooth their relationship as InBev absorbs Anheuser, sources said. InBev and Modelo declined to comment. (Reporting by  Jessica Hall ; Editing by  Anshuman Daga ) (For more M&A news and our DealZone blog, go to  here )
