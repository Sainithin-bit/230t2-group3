 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Freddie Mac began a closely watched auction of $3 billion of bills on Monday, a sale of securities that will be the first test of the housing finance company's market strength after the U.S. government took aggressive steps to shore up confidence in the GSEs. 

 A U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve plan to rescue mortgage agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac was announced on Sunday. The plan includes measures to lend money and buy equity if needed in the two largest U.S. home funding companies. Concerns about capitalization hammered the shares of both government-sponsored shareholder-owned companies to 17-year lows last week. The scheduled Freddie Mac offerings are $2 billion of three-month bills due October 14, 2008 and $1 billion of six-month bills due January 12, 2009. The bills are being sold over the Internet in a Dutch auction. In such uniform price auctions, successful bidders pay only the price of the lowest accepted bid rather than the actual price as in a conventional multiple-price auction. The auction ends at 9:45 a.m. EDT. Last week, Freddie Mac sold $2 billion each of 3-month and 6-month bills. The 3-month bills were auctioned at a stop-out rate, or lowest accepted rate, of 2.323 percent, and priced at 99.4193 for a money market yield of 2.337 percent. The 6-month maturity was sold at a 2.489 percent stop-out rate and priced at 98.7486 for a 2.521 percent money market yield. (Reporting by  Chris Sanders  and  Lynn Adler , Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)
