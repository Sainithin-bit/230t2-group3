 LONDON  (Reuters) - Alliance & Leicester ALLL.L said a takeover proposal from Spain's Santander ( SAN.MC ) was the only offer it had received despite widespread speculation that other predators have been circling. 

 A&L Chief Executive David Bennett said the 1.3 billion pound ($2.6 billion) offer from Santander provided investors with certainty in the face of a challenging outlook for banks. "We feel it's a good deal at a fair price. These are turbulent times and when we look forward it's not clear when that turbulence ends or reduces," Bennett told reporters on a conference call. He said the deal had been hammered out in just the last few days. The approach had been made since last Wednesday, when A&L named a new chairman, who it is now in further discussion with.
