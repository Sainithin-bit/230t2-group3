 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Fannie Mae, the largest U.S. home funding company, said on Monday it plans to sell $2.0 billion of three-month benchmark bills due October 15, 2008, and $1.0 billion of six-month bills due January 14, 2009, on Wednesday in a Dutch auction. 

 In such uniform price auctions, successful bidders pay only the price of the lowest accepted bid rather than the actual price as in a conventional multiple-price auction. Bids will be accepted from authorized dealers from 9:00 a.m., until 9:45 a.m.. Settlement is July 16-17. (Reporting by Caryn Trokie; Editing by Theodore d'Afflisio)
