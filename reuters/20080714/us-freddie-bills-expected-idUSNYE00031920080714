 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The clearing levels on $3 billion worth of Freddie Mac bills came stronger than early indications, reflecting strong demand from investors, according to Freddie Mac and a buyside source on Monday. 

 The stop-out rate on Freddie's new three-month bill came in at 2.309 percent, lower than the expected level between 2.34 percent and 2.35 percent. (Reporting by  Jennifer Ablan  and  Richard Leong ; Editing by  James Dalgleish )
