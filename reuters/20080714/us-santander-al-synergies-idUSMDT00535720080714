 MADRID  (Reuters) - Spain's Santander ( SAN.MC ) on Monday said it expected annual cost savings of around 180 million pounds by 2011 from its agreed merger with UK bank Alliance & Leicester. 

 Santander, which also owns UK bank Abbey, will need to bolster the capital of A&L by around 1 billion pounds to strengthen the UK bank's balance sheet and carry out the deal, the Spanish bank said during a Webcast on the deal. It expects the deal to add to earnings from the beginning of next year. Santander will integrate Abbey and A&L, cutting their combined assets by 20-30 billion pounds over two years, it said.
