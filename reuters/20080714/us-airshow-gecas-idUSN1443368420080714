 FARNBOROUGH  (Reuters) - General Electric Co's ( GE.N ) plane-leasing unit is not planning to make any purchases at this year's big airshow, and expects an industry-wide slowdown in orders, its chief executive said on Monday, as soaring fuel prices and tight credit beat down the airline business. 

 GE's Commercial Aviation Services (GECAS) unit, which vies with International Lease Finance Corp for the title of the world's biggest plane lessor, has been one of the biggest U.S. plane buyers in the last three years, helping to pump up Boeing and Airbus' order books to record levels. "I don't expect us to order at the show -- we've got a good order book through 2012," said Henry Hubschman, head of GECAS, in an interview at the air show. "We're comfortable where we are. But on the other hand, if we were presented with a particularly appealing order, we'd be flexible." So far, Hubschman said GECAS had not been presented with any such offers from the plane manufacturers. GECAS made orders worth more than $5 billion with Boeing Co ( BA.N ) and EADS ( EAD.PA ) unit Airbus at last year's Paris air show, and made a further order worth $4.5 billion with Boeing last December. That helped Boeing and Airbus set an industry record for orders last year. But few expect the order boom to continue this year as high oil prices and tight credit markets punish airlines. The first day of the Farnborough was quiet by recent standards. Gulf carrier Etihad Airways ordered 100 planes worth over $20 billion from Airbus and Boeing, but the Boeing portion, worth about half the total, was already reflected in Boeing's order book. "I don't view that as bad at all," said Hubschman, addressing the lack of big orders at the show. "If it (plane orders) continued at the rate it was going at, it was unsustainable." As a lessor, concerned that the supply of planes does not outstrip demand for air travel, Hubschman said he would have been more concerned if there had been more orders at the airshow. As conditions in the airline business deteriorate, GECAS is ready to deal with the consequences, Hubschman said, by taking back planes from bankrupt operators or doing more sale and leaseback deals with airlines. "We're prepared in the event we do see some additional early returns," said Hubschman. "We move pretty aggressively and proactively to place them (airplanes) someplace else." Sale and leasebacks, where GECAS buys a plane from an airline and then leases it back to the airline, tend to be more popular when cash is scarce and airlines' balance sheets are under pressure. "The market is cyclical," said Hubschman. "When times are bad, lease rates will move down somewhat, but the returns on cash, meaning sale-leasebacks or loans, go up." Hubschman declined comment on whether GE had considered selling or splitting off GECAS, as the industrial conglomerate faces calls from some shareholders to restructure. "We're quite happy to be GE, which should be obvious," he said. (Editing by David Cowell)
