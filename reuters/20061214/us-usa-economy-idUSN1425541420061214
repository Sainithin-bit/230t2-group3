 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The number of U.S. workers seeking initial jobless benefits fell 20,000 last week, while import prices rose last month despite an oil price drop, suggesting a resilient economy still facing inflation risks. 

 Adding to the picture of moderate but steady output, a snapshot of manufacturing in the Northeast, the New York Federal Reserve's "Empire State" general factory conditions index, slipped in December, but was higher than expected and showed gains in new orders and future business conditions measures. Financial markets took the data to signal a steady outlook for the economy and diminished chances of Federal Reserve interest-rate cuts next year. Stocks were up with the Dow Jones industrial average notching a record high, and Treasury debt prices slid, pushing yields, which move inversely to prices, to three-week highs. The dollar also rose. Fed funds futures trimmed chances of a Fed rate cut in the first quarter of 2007 to 10 percent, the lowest in a month, and still favored, but no longer fully expected, a rate cut by the end of the second quarter. The sharper-than-expected drop in first-time claims for state unemployment aid took initial filings down to 304,000 last week, the lowest since mid-October, a Labor Department report showed on Thursday. Wall Street analysts had expected claims to ease only slightly to 320,000. Economists, however, caution the data is often quite volatile through the holiday season. A separate Labor Department report showed U.S. import prices posted a surprising 0.2 percent rise in November, even though oil import prices fell. Analysts had expected prices to hold steady. The jobless claims data suggested the labor market remains solid, economist Brian Sack of Macroeconomic Advisers said. "Employment growth going forward is a big issue for the outlook in terms of what the Fed is going to do, and the more strength we see in employment the more reluctant the Fed will be to cut rates," he said. The U.S. central bank on Tuesday held benchmark overnight borrowing costs steady at 5.25 percent and restated concerns over what Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke has called "uncomfortably" high inflation. Despite those concerns, financial markets still look for the Fed to lower interest rates at some point next year, although the latest data combined with a report last Friday showing solid job growth in November to paint a picture of an economy weathering weakness in manufacturing and housing well. LABOR MARKET PULSE SOLID While economists cautioned that holiday-season volatility made it difficult to be certain of the underlying trend in layoffs, a four-week moving average of jobless claims offered a further suggestion of solid labor-market conditions. The average slipped 1,500 to 327,250 last week from 328,750 in the previous week. In addition, the number of people who remained on the benefit rolls after drawing an initial week of aid slid by 33,000 to 2.48 million in the December 2 week, the latest week for which these figures were available. The report on November import prices showed a 0.7 percent gain in non-petroleum prices, the biggest jump since May. Natural gas import prices shot up 30.3 percent, the steepest climb since November 2004. Non-petroleum industrial supplies and materials prices rose 2.9 percent, the biggest margin since October of last year. Petroleum import prices fell 1.6 percent, the third monthly decline. However, petroleum prices were up 1.5 percent for the year ending in November. The report also showed export prices rose a greater-than-expected 0.4 percent. Meanwhile, a report inadvertently released before schedule by the New York Fed showed manufacturing activity in New York State factories improved at a slower pace in December, as a result of lower unfilled orders, inventories and employment. The "Empire State" general factory conditions index slipped to 23.13 in December from 26.66 in November. The median forecast of the December reading among economists polled by Reuters was 18.00. But the report's new orders component rose to 25.12 in December from 22.38 in November, and the prices paid measure fell to 28.09 in December, its lowest of the year, from 34.90 in November. Moreover, the survey's future index on business conditions rose to 42.62, its highest since July. In a separate report, the Commerce Department said revenues in key parts of the U.S. service sector fell 0.1 percent in the third quarter, with gains in the information and health care sectors outweighed by drops in professional and administrative services. While the service sector accounts for some 80 percent of the U.S. economy, the report captures only a small portion of gross domestic product.
