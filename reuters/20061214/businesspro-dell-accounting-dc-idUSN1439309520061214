 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Computer maker Dell Inc. DELL.O 
filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on 
Thursday to delay its third-quarter financial report, citing 
ongoing regulatory investigations into its accounting and 
financial reporting matters. 

  The SEC, the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New 
York, and the company's audit committee have raised questions 
about Dell's financial reporting, including its reserves and 
other balance sheet items that may affect its previously 
reported financial results, the filing said.  The company said in its filing that it has not made any 
determinations on restatements. It said it is cooperating with 
investigators.
