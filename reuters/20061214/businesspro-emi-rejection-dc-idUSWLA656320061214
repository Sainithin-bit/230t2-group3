 LONDON  (Reuters) - British music company EMI Group Plc 
EMI.L said on Thursday it had ceased discussions with an 
unnamed group over an offer for the company as it did not fully 
reflect its prospects and value. 

  EMI said on November 28 it had received a bid approach and 
a source familiar with the situation said private equity firm 
Permira had made contact.  EMI's shares were down 8.1 percent at 276 pence at 1213 
GMT.  The company had declined to name its suitors. Analysts had 
put a possible price in the region of 2.5 billion pounds ($4.9 
billion).  Earlier this year, EMI was locked in a $4.6-billion 
takeover battle with Warner Music WMG.N, with each company 
trying to buy the other.  But hopes of a deal were quashed in June when a European 
court annulled approval of the 2004 merger of Sony Corp.'s 
( 6758.T ) Sony Music and Bertelsmann's BERT.UL BMG.  The ruling cast doubt on whether an EMI-Warner deal would 
get regulatory clearance, and the companies abandoned talks 
until there was more clarity from antitrust regulators.  EMI is home to the likes of Robbie Williams, Norah Jones 
and Coldplay.
