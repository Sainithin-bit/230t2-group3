 BEIJING  (Reuters) - China must step up the pace of economic reforms because the rest of the world is growing impatient for it to do so, U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said on Thursday. 

 "They're so big and such an economic powerhouse that the rest of the world is going to be impatient, particularly the U.S., and so they need to accelerate the reform," Paulson told a small group of reporters who traveled with him to Beijing for the inaugural session of a "strategic economic dialogue" between the two countries. Paulson was speaking after the first day of talks that are scheduled to wrap up on Friday. He described them as "productive and informative interchanges". Paulson said he agreed with a comment by Chinese Vice-Premier Wu Yi that America needed to better understand China's drive to reform its economy. "But having said that, there's certain things that there's plenty of understanding on, and they have just got to move quicker," he said. "There's no lack of understanding about currency flexibility or intellectual property and those kinds of issues." Paulson said it was not reasonable to expect that, after just two days of talks, there would be concrete agreements to be announced on Friday. "It wouldn't be much of a dialogue if you could come in and, in two days, sit down and announce major breakthroughs," he said. "The kinds of issues we are working on are ones that are very fundamental and very long-term," the U.S. Treasury chief said. Paulson said that when the talks wind up on Friday, they might be able to set out "work-plans" to move forward on resolving some of the economic issues that each sees as important.
