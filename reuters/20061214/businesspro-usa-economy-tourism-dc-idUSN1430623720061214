 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. tourism sales declined in the 
third quarter, the first slowdown in four years, on the back of 
new security restrictions for air travel announced in August, 
the Commerce Department said on Thursday. 

  Tourism sales dropped to $583.98 billion in the third 
quarter, from a revised $586.42 billion in the second quarter, 
for a decline of 1.7 percent on an annualized basis, the 
Commerce Department said in a quarterly report.  U.S. security officials banned passengers from carrying 
liquids onto planes after British officials said they foiled a 
plot to bomb flights to the United States during the second 
week of August.  Passenger air travel, after growing a revised 11.6 percent 
in the second quarter, plunged 11.6 percent in the third 
quarter, as the restrictions on carry-on items added to travel 
woes.  Traveler accommodations fell for the second straight 
quarter, dropping 4.2 percent in the third quarter, after a 1.1 
percent decline in the second quarter.  Tourism sales in the second quarter rose by a revised 1.9 
percent for the second quarter, the report said  Total direct tourism employment -- workers engaged in the 
production of goods and services sold to visitors -- rose 0.1 
percent in the second quarter after a revised 2.9 percent in 
the first quarter. The second quarter is the latest period for 
which employment figures are available.  Total tourism-related employment accounted for 8.3 million 
jobs in the second quarter, unchanged from the first quarter.  The total consisted of 5.7 million direct tourism jobs -- 
including airline pilots, hotel staff and souvenir sellers -- 
and 2.6 million indirect tourism jobs -- such as workers who 
make toiletries for hotels or truck drivers transporting jet 
fuel to commercial aircraft.
