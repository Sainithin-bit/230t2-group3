 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The number of U.S. workers seeking 
first-time jobless benefits fell more than expected last week, 
dropping from levels analysts had said were inflated by a 
holiday-related spike, a government report on Thursday showed. 

  First-time jobless claims fell by 20,000 to a seasonally 
adjusted 304,000 in the week ending December 9, down from 
324,000 in the previous week, the Labor Department said.  Wall Street analysts polled by Reuters had expected claims 
to ease more gradually to 320,000.  Seasonal factors - namely fluctuations in the data between 
the Thanksgiving and year-end holidays -- usually suggest a 
decline in claims of around 9.4 percent at this time, but in 
fact the unadjusted data fell by 15 percent, a Labor Department 
economist said.  The four-week moving average, considered a better gauge of 
labor trends because it irons out weekly fluctuations, slipped 
by 1,500 to 327,250 from 328,750 in the previous week.  The number of people who remained on the benefit rolls 
after drawing an initial week of aid slipped by 33,000 to 2.48 
million in the December 2 week, the latest week for which these 
figures were available, in line with analysts' expectations.
