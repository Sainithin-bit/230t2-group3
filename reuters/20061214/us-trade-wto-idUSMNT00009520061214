 MANILA  (Reuters) - World Trade Organization (WTO) Chief Pascal Lamy said on Thursday that all leading WTO member states had signaled flexibility for a re-start of global trade talks, but it was not yet clear if they were ready to negotiate. 

 "All the big players have given general signals of flexibility", Lamy said in a video conference call with a Philippine audience. The five-year-old WTO talks over reducing global trade subsidies and barriers were halted in July after major powers locked horns over politically sensitive issues, especially calls to dismantle agricultural protection. Trade officials say the suspension could last years without a breakthrough in early 2007. Discussions restarted on a limited basis last month, with various negotiating groups in Geneva revisiting technical issues. "They all said they wanted to resume the negotiations, which were done at the technical level in Geneva, but not yet at the ministerial level," Lamy said. "Whether and when it will result at a stage where ministers would be able to rejoin the table of negotiation -- not just to discuss, not just to think where we are, but to negotiate -- is something which is not yet clear," he added. "I hope it will clarify in the coming weeks."
