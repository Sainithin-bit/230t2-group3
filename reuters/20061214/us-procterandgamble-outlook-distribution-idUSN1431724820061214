 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Procter & Gamble Co. ( PG.N ) plans to cut its number of distribution centers in half over the next couple of years and is actively pursuing alternative energy sources, executives said on Thursday. 

 P&G, the world's largest household products company, has more than 450 storage and shipping points around the world. Its goal is to cut that number roughly in half, Vice Chairman of Global Operations Bob McDonald said at a meeting with analysts and investors, which was also broadcast over the Internet. The company aims to lower its distribution costs using fewer facilities. But at the same time, McDonald said that P&G is working on more custom products and displays for retailers. Such tactics should help P&G, whose products include Tide laundry detergent and Bounty paper towels, improve margins by 50 basis points to 75 basis points per year, said Chief Financial Officer Clayt Daley. That goal excludes margin benefits the company expects to achieve from the integration of Gillette, which it acquired in October 2005. Daley said that P&G is working with suppliers on alternative fuels like liquefied natural gas. It is also trying to take better advantage of by-products in its plants. Daley said that next year P&G will start up a co-generation unit at a plant in Mexico that should provide all of that plant's steam requirements and fill some energy needs for other plants across the country. P&G has already moved much of its production to low-cost locations. The company now produces over 30 percent of its volume of products in low-income markets, up from 20 percent at the beginning of the decade, Daley said. Since 1990, P&G has built 12 new plants, all in developing markets, Daley said, and is adding new capacity in such areas. The changes come as P&G continues to integrate operations previously owned by Gillette. Daley said that the integration is moving ahead on schedule. He also said that the company aims to keep capital expenditures at or below 4 percent of sales even with Gillette, which had operated with higher capital spending rates than P&G. P&G's capital expenditures are currently less than 4 percent of sales, down from more than 6 percent in 2001, Daley said. Shares of P&G were up 19 cents, or 0.3 percent, at $63.59 in midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
