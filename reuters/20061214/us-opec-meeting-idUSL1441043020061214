 ABUJA  (Reuters) - OPEC has agreed an oil output cut of 500,000 barrels per day, or two percent, delayed until February1 when the northern winter is ending, the group said on Thursday, sending oil prices above $62. 

 By postponing a further reduction until peak demand has passed, OPEC is acknowledging importer nations' concern that a cut now will drive prices higher and hurt their economies. World economic growth is expected to slow next year. "We are committed to supplying the market but we want to establish a balance between supply and demand," said OPEC President Edmund Daukoru. He confirmed Angola would become OPEC's 12th member in 2007, giving the cartel even more muscle. The group that pumps over a third of the world's oil has already curbed output this year -- by 1.2 million bpd to 26.3 million in October to halt a 10-week, 25 percent price slump. As recently as last week there was little doubt a further cut of at least 500,000 barrels per day would follow from Jan 1. But with oil above $60 and consumer nations on edge the mood shifted in some delegations toward a slight delay. U.S. oil was up $1.20 at $62.57 at 1722 GMT, having hit a session high of $62.72 on the news. OPEC is in agreement the market is oversupplied -- stocks in top consumer the United States are the highest since 1998 for the time of year -- but it wants to get the timing right. Cut too soon and prices could spike. Delay, and prices could fall sharply in the second quarter as demand slackens. "The market is out of balance - stocks are at more than a five-year high," Daukoru said. Consumer nations point out inventories are in decline. Oil stocks in OECD industrialized countries fell 40 million barrels in October, according to the International Energy Agency, and the trend continued in November. Saudi Oil Minister Ali Al-Naimi conceded the market is in better shape now than when ministers last met. He estimated OPEC had succeeded in removing half the excess 100 million barrels. But there was more work to do, said Naimi, who steers the policy of the world's leading oil exporter. Saudi Arabia is expected to shoulder 158,000 bpd of the latest cut, taking the kingdom's total supply curbs to more than 500,000 bpd. "I hope the market appreciates we are working so diligently to bring supply and demand in balance, to have inventories at a reasonable level so that we do not have gyrations," Naimi said. In a statement after the meeting, OPEC said projected oil demand growth next year of 1.3 million bpd would be more than offset by 1.8 million bpd of new supply from countries outside the organization -- the highest non-OPEC rise since 1984. BALANCING ACT The move to delay the output cut by a month should go some way to addressing the concerns of import-dependent countries. U.S. Energy Secretary Sam Bodman and International Energy Agency head Claude Mandil had both called on OPEC to wait before making further supply reductions. On Thursday, the IEA, adviser to 26 industrialized countries, called OPEC's decision to cut from February 1 unwelcome. "Given that you have a lot of forecasters expressing concern about economic growth, the high oil price doesn't help matters in any way," IEA economist Lawrence Eagles told Reuters. "There's no doubt the high oil prices are still causing a lot of strain on consumers." Oil has fallen from a mid-July peak of $78.40 but is still three times the price at the start of 2002 as Asian demand kicked in. Refining constraints and worries over supply from Iraq, Nigeria, Iran and Russia helped fuel the rally. Price hawks Iran and Venezuela said they expected oil to steady above $60 as a result of Thursday's agreement. Saudi Arabia insisted price had played no role in OPEC's decision. "A lot of things influenced our decision, including the dollar," Naimi said. Worries over U.S. economic weakness have knocked the dollar, eroding OPEC's purchasing power. Mike Wittner, head of energy market research at investment bank Calyon, said the deal was a good compromise. "It's a small cut, about as small as they come. But I think it underscores the message that they are trying to manage markets and crude supply," he said. Oil analyst Geoff Pyne added a note of skepticism. "It's a fudge which gets round the market and reconciles the two different views on what the group should do," he said.
