 (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ( WMT.N ) has voluntarily 
recalled about 56,000 stuffed toys due to a possible choking 
hazard to young children, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety 
Commission said on Thursday. 

  No incidents or injuries have been reported, the statement 
said. The stuffed Christmas beagles, priced at about $3, were 
sold at Wal-Mart stores nationwide from September 2006 through 
December 2006.  The group said the red pompoms on the wreath attached to 
the beagle's mouth could detach, posing a choking hazard.  (Reporting by Ankur Relia in Bangalore)
