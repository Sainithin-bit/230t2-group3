 CHICAGO/ NEW YORK  (Reuters) - AirTran Holdings Inc. AAI.N 
wants investors in Midwest Air Group Inc. MEH.A to persuade 
that carrier's management to reconsider a $290-million takeover 
bid, AirTran's chief executive said on Wednesday. 

  "I think shareholders will definitely call the management 
and ask why the heck they aren't taking the premium advantage 
we're offering," CEO Joe Leonard told Reuters in an interview.  The parent of AirTran Airways continues to seek talks to 
try to craft a deal with Midwest, he said, even though Midwest 
has said several times it prefers to remain independent.  "The reason we went public (with the bid) is that we have 
not been able to engage them in any kind of discussion," 
Leonard said.  Milwaukee-based Midwest rejected AirTran's offer in a 
private letter last week, but Chief Executive Timothy Hoeksema 
commented publicly on the matter on Wednesday.  "The board unanimously concluded that Midwest's business 
plan as a stand-alone company would support a considerably 
better return to our shareholders than AirTran's offer," he 
said in a statement.  AirTran is offering $11.25 a share in cash and stock, a 24 
percent premium over Midwest's $9.08 closing price on the 
American Stock Exchange on Tuesday. At that price, Midwest has 
a total equity value of about $290 million, AirTran said.  Midwest played down the value of the offer in its statement 
on Wednesday. "We view AirTran's offer at only about $5 per 
share, because it includes approximately $6 per share in cash 
that already belongs to our shareholders," Hoeksema said.  AirTran said the combination would create a low-cost 
airline with combined revenue of about $3 billion in 2007 and 
generate more than $60 million in estimated cost savings.  Yet a merger also could result in a small clash of cultures 
between the two airlines.  Midwest is well known for its in-flight perks such as 
leather seats and footrests on flights to leisure destinations, 
although the carrier scaled back some of its services after the 
September 11, 2001, terror attacks. AirTran has a business 
class, but generally offers a leaner, more basic service.
  LATEST CONSOLIDATION BUZZ  AirTran's push to buy Midwest marks the latest move by 
airlines to consolidate in the U.S. market. UAL Corp.'s 
UAUA.O United Airlines and Continental Airlines CAL.N have 
held preliminary talks about a potential merger, sources 
familiar with the situation said on Wednesday.  Orlando, Florida-based AirTran said it had originally 
outlined the merger proposal to Midwest on October 20.  Midwest rebuffed that proposal, AirTran said.  AirTran said it had sent another letter to the Midwest 
board on Wednesday, saying it would continue to pursue a deal.  In Wednesday's letter, AirTran said it was prepared to "sit 
down and enter into serious discussions and, following that, 
consider in our offer any enhanced values that may be 
demonstrated."  "The AirTran-Midwest deal has a much better chance of being 
done with the regulators," Calyon Securities analyst Ray Neidl 
said. "There is very little overlap. They are both relatively 
small companies."  A month ago, US Airways Group Inc. ( LCC.N ) offered to buy 
rival Delta Air Lines Inc. DALRQ.PK for $8.7 billion, raising 
expectations of consolidation in an industry struggling with 
high fuel prices and competition from discount carriers.  Talks between Continental and United, which each have 
market value of about $4 billion, picked up pace after US 
Airways made the offer last month.
