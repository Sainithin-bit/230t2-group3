 MELBOURNE  (Reuters) - Australia's Qantas Airways ( QAN.AX ) agreed on Thursday to a sweetened $8.7 billion buyout offer from a group led by Macquarie Bank Ltd. MBL.AX and private equity firm Texas Pacific Group in the world's biggest airline takeover. 

 The sale of the national icon, dubbed the flying kangaroo, has stirred nationalistic sentiment and reached the top levels of Australian politics, prompting the bidding group to stress that the airline would remain majority Australian owned. However, Prime Minister John Howard signaled the government was unlikely to interfere in any change of hands of the airline, founded 86 years ago in outback Queensland as an air taxi service. "I hope that the Qantas we know is the Qantas we keep. People like Qantas. It is an icon. That doesn't mean to say its shares can't change hands," Howard told Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio. The offer tops an $8.6 billion bid for bankrupt Delta Airlines DALRQ.PK by U.S. Airways Goup LLC.N in November, and would be the biggest private equity buyout in Asia, outside of Japan, if approved by shareholders early next year. It coincides with a wave of consolidation talk across the industry, including recent merger talks between UAL Corp. UAUA.O, parent of United Airlines, and Continental Airlines  CAL.N. The offer of A$5.60 a share, 10 percent above Qantas's last trade on Wednesday, was unanimously endorsed by the Qantas board after the bidders dropped a demand for a break-up fee and simplified other conditions. The board rejected an offer of A$5.50 on Wednesday. Qantas shares, publicly traded since 1995, stayed below the offer price all day, suggesting investors were not going to hold out for a better bid. The shares closed up 3.7 percent at A$5.28 after touching a record high A$5.37. "Qantas never traded anywhere near this before. So we are happy with the price that is being offered," said Ross Barker, chief executive of Australian Foundation Investment Co., which manages about A$4 billion in funds including Qantas. The offer price is 29 percent higher than Qantas's share price before the airline said on November 22 that it had been approached with a buyout offer. REMAIN AUSTRALIAN Looking to reassure politicians and unions, the bid team Airline Partners Australia said it had no plans to break up Qantas, send its maintenance operations offshore, or cut regional Australian routes. Qantas Chief Executive Geoff Dixon refused to bow to a union call for the new owners to guarantee existing jobs and entitlements of Qantas workers. But he did say the new owners do not plan to speed up the airline's drive to cut a further A$1.5 billion in costs over the next two years. The bid values Qantas at a 61 percent premium to its average share price in the six months to November and at 15.9 times forecast earnings for 2007, compared with regional rivals Singapore Airlines Ltd. ( SIAL.SI ) trading at 12.9 and Cathay Pacific Airways ( 0293.HK ) at 17.8, according to Reuters data. The bidding team has been carefully shaped to ensure it meets ownership caps on Australia's flag carrier, which require the airline to remain majority Australian-owned, with no individual shareholder owning more than 25 percent. The airline will be 27 percent owned by Allco Equity Partners AEQ.AX, with Texas Pacific Group owning 25 percent, Allco Finance Group AFG.AX 8 percent, Macquarie with less than 15 percent, Canadian investment firm Onex Corp. ( OCX.TO ) 12.5 percent and other foreign investors combined with 11.5 percent. Voting stakes are slightly different. Qantas management will hold 1 percent, with Dixon, 66, staying on as chief executive for at least the next three years. All the key members of Airline Partners have been deeply involved with the airline industry. Allco Finance's directors include former British Airways chief executive Rod Eddington and former Cathay Pacific chairman David Turnbull. Allco Equity Partners said that it would raise A$682 million to part fund its share of the acquisition, which would see it become Qantas's largest shareholder. The consortium did not give any other details on how it would fund the deal, but said it would keep A$2 billion in cash on Qantas's balance sheet. Market sources suggested at least A$8 billion to A$9 billion of the acquisition would be funded by debt. The consortium was talking to Calyon and Morgan Stanley to provide a combination of loans and bonds. The package will also involve the securitization of Qantas' assets, said a market source who declined to be identified. International ratings agencies are expected to cut the credit ratings to high yield status if it takes on heavy debt. Qantas's credit is currently rated BBB+ by Standard & Poor's and Baa1 by Moody's. Qantas's credit default swap (CDS), which measures the risk of default of a company, widened by 80 basis points on Thursday. "We can expect Qantas' five-year CDS to widen further to 250 basis points until the market sees the financing details," said Craig Saalmann, credit strategist at ABN AMRO. The government has only once before blocked a takeover on national interest grounds, stopping Royal Dutch Shell ( RDSa.L ) buying Woodside Petroleum Ltd. ( WPL.AX ) on fears that Shell would develop offshore projects ahead of Woodside's local gas projects. The consortium will have to win over the U.S. and European arms of U.S. fund manager Capital Group, which together own 12.7 percent of Qantas, as the bid is conditional on securing 90 percent acceptance. UBS ( UBSN.VX ) advised Qantas on the deal, while Macquarie advised the consortium.
