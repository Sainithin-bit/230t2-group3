 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Communications equipment maker Ciena Corp. ( CIEN.O ) reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit on Thursday and issued a bright outlook for the first quarter, sending its shares as much as 10 percent higher. 

 The Maryland-based company gave first-quarter profit outlook in a range that outpaced Wall Street expectations. Shares of Ciena and other equipment makers, whose shares were lifted on Thursday by Ciena's report, have been buoyed by phone companies that are upgrading their networks to offer Internet and television services. "Last year at this time, we said we were beginning to see signs of improving overall market strength and that our network specialist strategy positioned us to take advantage of that and I think that has happened," Ciena Chief Executive Gary Smith told analysts on a conference call. "Demand for next generation technologies continues to rise as the need intensifies for our customers to support a growing number of advanced services and applications," Smith said. The company posted a net profit of $13.1 million, or 14 cents per share, in the fiscal fourth quarter ending October 31, compared with a net loss of $252.9 million, or $3.06 per share, a year earlier, when it booked an impairment charge for goodwill and other assets of $222.3 million. Excluding items, Ciena, which makes equipment to help move data over fiber-optic networks, posted a profit of 16 cents per share, beating the average Wall Street estimate of 12 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue rose 35.3 percent to $160 million, matching Wall Street estimates. "We believe there was some expectation (financial results) could come in light," Morgan Keegan & Co. analyst Simon Leopold said. "Several customers including BT and Sprint were better customers in the quarter, offsetting weakness in traditional baby bells AT&T, BellSouth and Verizon." Keegan said Ciena spent less on research and development, which was $26.6 million, in its fiscal fourth quarter than he expected. Keegan expected the firm to spend $27.1 million. Total operating expense for the fourth quarter fell to $68.9 million from $301.8 million a year ago, Ciena said. Looking ahead, the company said it expected revenue to rise by a low single-digit percentage rate in the first quarter 2007 on a sequential basis. Ciena expects first-quarter net profit per share to be 9 cents to 14 cents. Excluding items, profit per share is expected to reach 19 cents to 24 cents. Wall Street expected the company to post a first-quarter profit of 19 cents. "Based on our current order pipeline we see growth improving during the balance of the year," Ciena said in a statement. Ciena shares rose $2.33 to $27.29 on the Nasdaq. Shares of equipment makers Juniper Networks JNPR.O rose 65 cents, or 3.3 percent to $20.33; Tellabs Inc. ( TLAB.O ) rose 35 cents, or 3.3 percent to $10.41; Sonus Networks ( SONS.O ) rose 14 cents, or 2.1 percent, to $6.67; JDS Uniphase ( JDSU.O ) rose $1.15, or 6.85 percent to $17.95 on Nasdaq.
