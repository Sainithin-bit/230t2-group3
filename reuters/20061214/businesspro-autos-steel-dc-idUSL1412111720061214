 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - U.S. and Japanese automakers joined 
forces on Thursday to urge Washington to drop tariffs on steel 
used in making cars, arguing the U.S. steel industry was strong 
enough to handle imports that can push prices down. 

  "The tariffs on corrosion-resistant steel -- the type of 
steel used most in cars and trucks -- must end," senior U.S. 
officials from General Motors ( GM.N ), Ford ( F.N ), Chrysler 
DCXGn.DE, Honda ( 7267.T ), Nissan ( 7201.T ) and Toyota ( 7203.T ) 
wrote in The Wall Street Journal newspaper.  "This special protection, in place since 1993, is no longer 
needed. It increases costs and puts us at a competitive 
disadvantage against other manufacturers outside the U.S.," 
they said in a joint contribution.  The article was timed to coincide with a vote by the U.S. 
International Trade Commission on whether to renew the duties.  The car executives said higher steel prices caused by the 
duties had cost them more than $3 billion over the past three 
years, making them less competitive and boosting the prices 
U.S. customers have to pay for a car.  "Domestic steel producers are valuable partners for all 
U.S. and North American auto and auto parts producers, and we 
are prepared to pay a fair price for steel. However, for the 
health of all U.S. manufacturers, we oppose unnecessary 
protection for steel or any other industry that is thriving, 
powerful, profitable and globally competitive," they wrote.
