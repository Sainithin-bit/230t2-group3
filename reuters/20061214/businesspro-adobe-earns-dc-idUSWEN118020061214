 BOSTON  (Reuters) - Adobe Systems Inc. ( ADBE.O ) said on 
Thursday quarterly profit rose on higher sales of its computer 
programs used for design, photo editing and document sharing. 

  The maker of Photoshop and Acrobat software said that 
fourth-quarter net income rose to $181.9 million, or 30 cents 
per share, from $156.3 million, or 31 cents a year earlier.  Per-share net income was down because the number of Adobe 
shares rose from a year earlier.  Revenue rose to $682.2 million during the quarter ended 
December 1 from $510.4 million in the year-earlier quarter.
