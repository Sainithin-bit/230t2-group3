 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - DaimlerChrysler's high inventory -- 
built up due to weakening demand -- has triggered a halt in 
production at several U.S. auto assembly plants, the Wall 
Street Journal reported on its Web site on Thursday. 

  Chrysler is planning to suspend production at the plants 
for as much as four weeks going over the Christmas holiday in a 
bid to get inventories to normal levels, the paper said, citing 
people familiar with the matter.  The move could hurt the car maker's revenue, because auto 
companies book revenue based on the new vehicles they ship to 
dealers, the paper said.  The plants in line for longer stoppages include truck 
factories in St. Louis, Warren, Mich., and Newark, Del.; a Jeep 
plant in Detroit; and minivan plants in Windsor, Ontario, and 
St. Louis, it said.  Chrysler plans to announce on Thursday that it has reduced 
its stock of cars built without dealer orders -- referred to as 
"unassigned" vehicles -- to fewer than 20,000, the paper said, 
citing people familiar with the matter. That would be down from 
as high as 100,000 earlier this year.  It also plans to say it will finish 2006 with about 525,000 
vehicles on dealer lots, giving it a total U.S. inventory of 
roughly 545,000 cars and trucks, the WSJ said.  DaimlerChrysler was not immediately available for comment.
