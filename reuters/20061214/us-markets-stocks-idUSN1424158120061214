 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. stocks surged on Thursday, driving the Dow industrials to a record close on strong earnings from companies such as investment bank Bear Stearns Cos. and an improving outlook for the U.S. economy. 

 The Dow notched its 19th record close since the beginning of October, closing at 12,416.76, while the S&P 500 hit a six-year high. Stock investors defied a nearly 2 percent jump in oil prices after OPEC decided to cut production again, a step that pushed up shares of energy companies such as Exxon Mobil Corp.. Exxon rose 1.8 percent to $78.73 and was a top boost for the Dow. "I believe it is the combination of decent economic news and decent company earnings reports" boosting stocks, said Michelle Clayman, chief investment officer at New Amsterdam Partners in New York. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 99.26 points, or 0.81 percent, while the Standard & Poor's 500 Index jumped 12.28 points, or 0.87 percent, to end at 1,425.49. The Nasdaq Composite Index finished up 21.44 points, or 0.88 percent, at 2,453.85. Companies in sectors ranging from financial services to retail to technology reported robust profits. Bear Stearns' shares jumped 2.6 percent to $159.96 as it became the latest investment bank this week to post forecast-beating earnings. Among retailers, shares of Costco Wholesale Corp., the largest U.S. warehouse club, rose 1.8 percent to $54.11 after it reported better-than-expected results. And shares of telecommunications equipment provider Ciena Corp. jumped 11.5 percent to $27.83 after it, too, posted higher quarterly profits. Also contributing to the Nasdaq's and Dow's climbs were shares of Microsoft Corp., which rose 1.8 percent to $30.07 after UBS raised its price target on the software maker to $34 from $33. Shares of General Electric, which boosted its dividend earlier this week, were the second-biggest advancer on the S&P 500 behind Exxon. They finished up 2 percent at $36.21. Volume was moderate on the New York Stock Exchange, where about 1.57 billion shares changed hands, below last year's daily average of 1.61 billion. On the Nasdaq, about 1.98 billion shares were traded, above last year's daily average of 1.80 billion. Advancers outnumbered decliners by a ratio of nearly 2-to-1 on the NYSE while on the Nasdaq, advancers beating decliners by about 8-to-5. (Additional reporting by  John Parry )
