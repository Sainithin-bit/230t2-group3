 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Advanced Micro Devices Inc. ( AMD.N ) gave a strong 2007 outlook for gross margins on Thursday and said its microprocessor sales would grow twice as fast as the industry average of 10 percent due to market share gains. 

 AMD shares jumped 13 percent after the company also raised its estimate for cost savings from its October acquisition of Canadian graphics chip maker ATI Technologies. The forecasts pushed up the whole semiconductor sector. AMD, which trails only Intel Corp. ( INTC.O ) in the computer processor market, estimated gross margin at 50 percent "plus or minus" two points in 2007. That was better than the high 40 percent range forecast by two analysts, who expected ATI to drag more on AMD. "Their gross margin target for 2007 is very good," said American Technology research analyst Doug Freedman. "Clearly if it gets to 52 percent it would be phenomenal." AMD and Intel have been engaged in a price war that has hurt profit margins and weighed on share prices. AMD's gross margin fell to 51.4 percent in the third quarter, which did not include ATI, from 56.8 percent in the prior quarter. The company set a long term estimate for gross margins in the 51 percent to 56 percent range. AMD also doubled its estimate for cost savings from the ATI deal to $150 million in 2007 from $75 million. The forecasts were given at AMD's analyst day. The company, which bought ATI for $5.4 billion to give it better high-end graphics products for mobile computing, gaming and media markets, also raised its estimate for 2008 savings from the deal to $220 million from $125 million. MARKET SHARE Chief Executive Hector Ruiz expected overall demand for microchips to rise 10 percent in 2007, but forecast AMD's unit sales growth would be double that. He saw strong growth in laptop computers and from new customer Dell Inc. DELL.O. "Our growth is largely a function of being able to gain share," Ruiz told Reuters on the sidelines of the conference. AMD had a roughly 23 percent share of the computer processor market in the third quarter of this year, up from almost 18 percent a year ago, according to market tracking firm Mercury Research. In comparison, Intel's market share fell to 76 percent from almost 81 percent a year ago, it said. But Intel has been fighting back by overhauling its entire product line and slashing prices on older products, in an effort to clear unsold chips to make way for new processors. Ruiz did not give fourth quarter margin guidance, but suggested that while prices were still competitive the pressure seemed to be easing. "We don't see some of the crazy things that happened in the second and third quarter," said Ruiz. AMD shares rose $2.62 to $22.79 on the New York Stock Exchange, helping to push up the Philadelphia Stock Exchange's semiconductor index .SOXX by 2 percent. Intel shares were up 14 cents, or less than 1 percent, at $20.86. But AMD shares are still down 26 percent this year, compared with a 17 percent loss in Intel.
