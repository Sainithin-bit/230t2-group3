 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Home furnishings retailer Pier 1 
Imports Inc. ( PIR.N ) on Thursday posted a wider quarterly loss 
as the company cut prices to try to attract more business. 

  The company posted a loss of $72.7 million, or 83 cents a 
share, in the fiscal third quarter ended November 25, 2006, 
compared with a loss of $7.2 million, or 8 cents a share, a 
year earlier.  Analysts on average forecast a loss of 33 cents a share, 
according to Reuters Estimates.  Pier 1 shares have lost more than 20 percent this year as 
it has posted 10 consecutive months of declining sales at 
stores open at least a year.  The company said in May it would consider strategic 
options, including asset sales. The stock rallied in 
mid-November on a report that Danish retail magnate Jakup 
Jacobsen, who owns a minority stake in the retailer, was 
preparing to make a bid for full control.
