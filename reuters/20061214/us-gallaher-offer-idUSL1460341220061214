 LONDON  (Reuters) - The world's third largest cigarette group, Japan Tobacco Inc ( 2914.T ), on Thursday made a 7.5 billion pound ($14.7 billion) cash offer for rival Gallaher Group Plc GLH.L, sources close to the situation said. 

 Benson & Hedges and Silk Cut maker Gallaher said the preliminary offer was at 11.40 pounds per share, but did not identify the bidder. Gallaher was forced into a statement after press reports put a higher price on an offer from Japan Tobacco. The cash offer puts a total value on Gallaher, the world's fifth largest tobacco group, at 9.7 billion pounds when including 2.2 billion pounds in debt, and comes after the first announcement of an initial approach last week. Many analysts said that Japan Tobacco's offer was at a good price and Gallaher shareholders should accept, while the bidder was in a strong position backed by a hefty cash pile and the low cost of raising capital in Japan. Gallaher shares jumped to 1,198-1/2 pence before closing up 0.4 percent at 11.55 pounds after the shares had leapt to a new record high of 12.10 pounds on December 7, the first day of London trading after the initial bid was reported. The British firm announced late on December 6 it had received a bid approach, and although the company did not name the bidder, the sources identified the group as Japan Tobacco. "Gallaher announces that it is in discussions with a third party about the possibility of a recommended cash offer being made for the whole of the issued share capital of Gallaher at a price of 1,140p per share," the group said in the statement. Gallaher added there can be no certainty that an offer will be made nor as to the terms on which any offer might be made. "This is a good price and Gallaher shareholders should accept it," said analyst Michael Smith at JP Morgan, who added that the bid puts Gallaher on a "fair" valuation of around 12.5 times the group's forecast 2007 EBITDA earnings. David Ireland at ABN AMRO added: "This is a good deal and Gallaher shareholders ought to be happy with 11.40 pounds". Gallaher shares traded at a year low of eight pounds in June. Analysts said a deal would make a good match in Europe, with Gallaher earning 70 percent of its profits from Britain, Ireland, Austria and Sweden, while Japan Tobacco is strong in Spain, France and Italy. Both are major players in the fast-growing tobacco markets of the former Soviet Union. Japan Tobacco has $10.6 billion in cash and cash equivalents and has said it is always seeking acquisitions to raise its global profile after its last major deal in 1999. Japan Tobacco, which owns the world's number two cigarette brand Mild Seven and also Camel, Winston and Salem outside the United States, is keen to expand outside Japan as although it has a two-thirds share of its domestic market it has seen smoking levels decline and its market share fall, analysts said. A successful Japan Tobacco bid would reinforce its world number three position behind Marlboro maker Altria Group Inc. ( MO.N ) and British American Tobacco Plc ( BATS.L ), while analysts say a rival bid is unlikely from one of these two bigger groups. For Japan Tobacco, still 50 percent owned by the Japanese government, overseas cigarette sales have been the main driver of profit growth. In 2005 its international volumes overtook its Japanese volumes for the first time. The move could trigger a spate of moves similar to 1999 when Japan Tobacco's purchase of the non-U.S. side of RJR Nabisco for $7.8 billion prompted BAT to buy Rothmans, and France's Seita and Spain's Tabacalera to merge and form Altadis ALT.MC. Britain's Imperial Tobacco Group Plc ( IMT.L ), ranked fourth in the world, has been linked with a possible bid for sixth-ranked Altadis over the last two years. Analysts say if Japan Tobacco is successful, it could sell-off Gallaher's German and Austrian distribution businesses to Altadis for $1 billion to get around any antitrust problems.
