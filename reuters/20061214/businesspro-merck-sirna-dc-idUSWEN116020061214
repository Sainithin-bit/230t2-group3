 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Merck & Co. ( MRK.N ) said on Thursday 
its $1.1 billion deal to buy Sirna Therapeutics Inc.RNAI.O 
cleared an antitrust hurdle and said the deal could close as 
early as the end of this month. 

  The federal regulatory antitrust waiting period under the 
Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act expired December 
13.  Merck said the deal, which is expected to close in late 
December 2006 or early in the first quarter of 2007, remains 
subject to other conditions, including approval of the merger 
by holders of Sirna's common stock.  Merck in October agreed to buy the biotechnology firm to 
gain a foothold in the emerging drug development area known as 
RNA interference, which is based on the idea of shutting off 
the genetic messenger cells that trigger disease.
