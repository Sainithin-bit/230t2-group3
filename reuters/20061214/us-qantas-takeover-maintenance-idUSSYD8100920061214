 MELBOURNE  (Reuters) - Airline Partners Australia, bidding A$11.1 billion ($8.7 billion) for Qantas Airways Ltd. ( QAN.AX ), said they do not plan to break up the airline, move its maintenance operations offshore or cut regional routes. 

 The three issues had been raised by politicians and unions who were concerned about Australia's flag carrier being taken over by private equity groups and Macquarie Bank Ltd. MBL.AX. "We won't be breaking up the airline," the consortium's head, Bob Mansfield, told reporters. ($1=A$1.27)
