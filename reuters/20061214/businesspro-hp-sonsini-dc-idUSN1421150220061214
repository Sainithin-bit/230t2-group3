 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Hewlett-Packard's ( HPQ.N ) board has 
ended an advisory relationship with Larry Sonsini, the powerful 
Silicon Valley lawyer, the New York Times said on its Web site 
on Thursday, citing a person with close connections to the 
board. 

  After the year's end Sonsini and the firm he helped build, 
Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, will no longer serve as 
outside counsel to the board, the paper said, although the law 
firm will still do legal work for Hewlett-Packard, the world's 
second-largest computer company.  A spokesman for Hewlett-Packard was not immediately 
available for comment. Larry Sonsini and the firm Wilson 
Sonsini were not immediately available for comment.  The New York Times reported a spokesman for the Sonsini 
firm as saying, "There is a lot of ongoing work with HP." The 
paper said that Larry Sonsini had no comment.  Earlier this year HP endured an embarrassing disclosure of 
its investigation into boardroom leaks to the media, which 
spurred a probe by the California state attorney general. HP's 
investigators had impersonated HP board directors, employees 
and reporters to obtain private telephone records in a scandal 
that ultimately caused Chairman Patricia Dunn to resign.  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission had also 
ordered a formal investigation into its boardroom spying 
scandal.
