 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Bear Stearns Cos. BSC.N said on 
Thursday quarterly net income soared 38 percent helped by gains 
from fees for merger advice and underwriting debt for 
corporations and acquisition-hungry private equity firms. 

  A Wall Street powerhouse in packaging home loans into 
mortgage-backed bonds, Bear Stearns said it turned in its best 
quarter ever, easily beating Wall Street expectations.  Net income was $563 million, or $4 a diluted share, for the 
quarter ended November 30, compared with $407 million, or $2.90 
a diluted share, in the year-earlier quarter. The average 
estimate was $3.36 a share, according to Reuters Estimates.  Net revenue rose to $2.41 billion over the year-earlier 
period.  Investment banking net revenue climbed 58 percent to $364 
million on higher underwriting and merger and acquisition 
transaction volumes, the company said. Credit derivatives, 
distressed debt and leveraged finance pushed up fixed income 
net revenue 25 percent to $1.1 billion.  On Tuesday, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. ( GS.N ) kicked off the 
earnings season for Wall Street's investment banks with 
quarterly earnings that nearly doubled to $3.15 billion. 
Goldman's profits in 2006 were more than the previous two years 
combined.  Bear Stearns shares are up 38 percent this year, beating 
the 24 percent gain on the AMEX Securities Broker Dealer Index
