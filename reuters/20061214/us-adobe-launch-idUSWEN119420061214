 BOSTON  (Reuters) - Adobe Systems Inc. ( ADBE.O ) plans to begin a major product launch in its second quarter, releasing upgrades to its full line of design software, the company's chief executive said on Thursday. 

 English versions of those programs, which are sold under the Creative Suite brand, will start shipping at the end of the second quarter, Adobe CEO Bruce Chizen said in an interview with Reuters. Foreign language versions will be released early in the third fiscal quarter. "It will be the biggest release in Adobe's history," he said. Adobe offers about 10 Creative Suite software programs including Photoshop photo editing software and Acrobat document sharing programs. They are sold individually and in bundles.
