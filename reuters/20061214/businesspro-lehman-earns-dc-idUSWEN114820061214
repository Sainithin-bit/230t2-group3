 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers 
Holdings Inc. LEH.N on Thursday said its fiscal 
fourth-quarter profit rose 22 percent on increased income from 
mergers, offerings and trading. 

  Lehman, the fourth-largest U.S. securities firm by market 
value, said net income rose to $1 billion, or $1.72 a share, 
for the three months ended November 30, from $823 million, or 
$1.38, in the year-ago period. Net revenue rose 23 percent, to 
$4.5 billion, from a year ago.  Analysts on average expected Lehman to report a profit of 
$1.73 a share for the quarter, according to Reuters Estimates.  Wall Street firms in the quarter rebounded from a sluggish 
summer to cap off a record year amid robust M&A and leveraged 
buyout activity, stock and debt offerings and trading.  The shares, which closed Wednesday at $76.37, are up 19 
percent this year, compared with a 13 percent advance by the 
benchmark S&P 500 Index  .SPX
