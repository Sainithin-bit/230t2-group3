  By  Joseph A. Giannone NEW YORK  Dec 14 (Reuters) - Investment bank Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc. LEH.N on Thursday said its
fourth-quarter profit surged 22 percent with strong gains in
almost every business line, but the results fell short of the
bar set earlier this week by rival Goldman Sachs.  Lehman, the No. 4 U.S. securities firm by market value,
said net income rose to $1 billion, or $1.72 a share, for the
three months ended Nov. 30, from $823 million, or $1.38, in the
year-ago period.  Net revenue rose 23 percent to $4.5 billion.  The results exceeded the average analyst earnings forecast
of $1.68 a share, according to Reuters Estimates, but did so by
the smallest margin in six quarters. They also paled next to
Goldman ( GS.N ), which on Tuesday posted a 93 percent jump in
quarterly profit and 34 percent return on equity for the year.  "They did a great, great job," said Michael Holland, a fund
manager and head of Holland & Co. "But they suffered by
comparison with the results from Goldman, which were
extraterrestrial. The expectations for Lehman were higher
because of Goldman."  The reaction from investors was mixed in early trade, as
Lehman's share price swung between modest gains and declines of
as much as 1.6 percent. In midday trade, the stock was up 17
cents to $76.54.  Wall Street firms in the quarter rebounded from a sluggish
summer to cap off a record year amid robust M&A and leveraged
buyout activity, stock and debt offerings and trading. For the
year, Lehman reported record profit of $4 billion with all-time
high revenue and a return on equity of 22 percent.  "We believe our franchise has tremendous momentum going
into 2007," Lehman Brothers Chief Financial Officer Chris
O'Meara said on a conference call.  SOLID QUARTER  Lehman's trading revenue rose 28 percent to $3 billion,
fueled by its second-best quarter ever in debt markets, even as
U.S. housing prices and mortgage demand cooled. Results were
driven by customer trading activity and growth in asset-based
securities, muted by interest rate and currency businesses.  The equities business also had its second-best quarter,
rising 8 percent to $900 million on greater market activity and
growth in prime brokerage services to hedge funds. These
results include $70 million from private-equity investments.  Lehman's investment banking fees rose 5 percent to a record
$858 million, driven by strong debt and stock underwriting
activity. Debt issuance continues to soar thanks to the mergers
boom and low interest rates.  Fees from merger and acquisitions, however, fell 7 percent,
even as the industry wraps up a record year in M&A. At the end
of November, the bank's backlog of M&A transactions was $348
billion, up from $236 billion a year ago.  The equity underwriting pipeline is down 11 percent at $17
billion from last year, while pending debt origination volumes
are 14 percent higher at $58 billion, O'Meara said.  Money management and wealth management revenue surged 26
percent to a record $640 million, as managed assets grew to
$225 billion from $207 billion in the third quarter. Lehman's
book value rose 5 percent to $33.87 a share.  Analysts said Lehman's costs were higher then expected,
with compensation comprising 49 percent of revenue. Salaries
and bonuses, reflecting the tremendous growth in revenue, rose
24 percent to $2.24 billion.  Other expenses rose 15 percent as the company expands into
new markets, particularly in Japan and India, and builds out
its mortgage and banking businesses. Headcount worldwide surged
13 percent to 25,936 employees during the year.  Yet investors are growing more cautious as they look ahead,
concerned that Wall Street earnings may have peaked.  "We understand 2006 has been such a great year for M&A, a
great deal year," said Scott Armiger, a portfolio manager at
Christiana Bank & Trust in Delaware. "We do see the economy
slowing and that's got to factor in the investment banks'
earnings next year."
