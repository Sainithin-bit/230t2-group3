 BOSTON  (Reuters) - Honeywell International Inc. ( HON.N ) 
expects earnings to rise 13 percent to 17 percent in 2007, but 
high commodity and energy costs will keep margins under 
pressure, the diversified manufacturer said on Thursday. 

  The company, which makes products ranging from cockpit 
electronics to temperature-management systems for buildings, 
forecast a 2007 profit of $2.85 to $2.95 per share. Analysts' 
average forecast was $2.93, according to Reuters Estimates.  Honeywell said it expects sales to rise about 5 percent to 
$32.6 billion.  "The softness that we see in terms of the overall global 
economy is relatively evident in the United States," said Dave 
Anderson, chief financial officer, on a conference call with 
investors. "At the same time, economic statistics in Europe and 
Asia support growth expectations in those regions."  Honeywell is the third top U.S. conglomerate to set out its 
2007 financial forecast this week. General Electric Co. ( GE.N ) 
on Tuesday said it expected profit to rise 10 percent to 13 
percent, and United Technologies Corp. ( UTX.N ) on Wednesday 
forecast an increase of 10 percent to 14 percent.  With Wall Street increasingly concerned about a slowdown in 
the U.S. economy, investors have been keeping an eye on 
corporate forecasts for signs of slowing profit growth. GE's 
forecast was slightly below expectations, while the United 
Technologies forecast was largely in line with estimates.  J.P. Morgan analyst Stephen Tusa wrote in a note to 
clients, "Honeywell's '07 outlook comes about in line with our 
below-consensus expectations. While the stock could see a 
relief rally (stock was weak into the guidance), concerns could 
linger around the moving parts on segment profits for both '06 
and '07."  Anderson said Honeywell expects commodity and energy costs 
to remain high next year, keeping up pressure on margins.  The Morris Township, New Jersey-based company's profit has 
risen so far this year, boosted by a robust aerospace market 
and continued strength in the commercial construction sector, 
which has held up even as the U.S. residential real estate 
market cooled.  But when Honeywell reported third-quarter results it warned 
that it sees the world economy slowing. Analysts now expect the 
company to report full-year 2006 earnings of $2.52 per share, 
with fourth-quarter profit of 72 cents per share, according to 
Reuters Estimates.  Honeywell on Thursday confirmed that it expects a 2006 
profit of $2.51 to $2.53 per share.  As of Wednesday's close, Honeywell shares were up 12.4 
percent so far this year, slightly behind the 14.9 percent gain 
in the blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average.  .DJI .  The shares rose 62 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $42.48 in 
early trade on the New York Stock Exchange.
