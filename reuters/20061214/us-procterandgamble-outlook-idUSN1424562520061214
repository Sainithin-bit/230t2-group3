 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Procter & Gamble Co. ( PG.N ) said on Thursday that it should return to double-digit earnings per share growth in its next fiscal year and will cut the number of its distribution sites in half as it forges ahead with the integration of Gillette. 

 The company also stood by its sales and profit forecasts for the current fiscal second quarter as it met with analysts and investors at its headquarters in Cincinnati. "I don't think there were any surprises to anyone," said SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analyst Bill Chappell, who attended Thursday's meeting. Over the past few years, P&G has worked on expanding higher-margin businesses such as bringing the Olay line beyond skin lotions and creams into serums and peels. It has also worked on its relationships with retailers, moved some of its marketing spending away from television and taken a closer look at how to sell its products to lower income consumers, particularly in developing countries. "These choices are paying off and our business is healthy," said Chief Financial Officer Clayt Daley during the company presentation, which was broadcast on the Internet. At the same time, P&G has grown through acquisitions, most notably the October 2005 purchase of Gillette for $57 billion. Shares of P&G, a component of the Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  were up 15 cents to $63.55 after rising as high as $63.78 on the New York Stock Exchange. Chappell said that while the company outlined how things are moving forward, such as plans for two new Gillette razors - a new version of Fusion for men and Venus Breeze for women - there were "no surprises, no real new information." Chip Bergh, president of global grooming, said Venus Breeze has a flexible strip of shaving gel, eliminating the need to use a separate shaving cream, reminiscent of Schick's Intuition, made by rival Energizer Holdings Inc. ( ENR.N ). GUIDANCE INTACT P&G, best known for products such as Tide detergent and Pampers diapers, said it still expects to earn 81 cents to 83 cents a share in the fiscal second quarter, which ends this month. Analysts, on average, expect 84 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. The company also still expects second-quarter sales growth of 5 percent to 8 percent, and growth of "organic" sales, or those excluding mergers and the impact of foreign exchange, of 4 percent to 7 percent. "Given this high-profile event, we thought P&G could have raised their guidance, as they have done many times mid-quarter," Bear Stearns analyst Justin Hott said in a note to clients. He has a "peer perform" rating on the shares. Over the past four quarters, P&G's sales have benefited from the addition of Gillette to the company's product lineup. In the first quarter, sales jumped 27 percent. But the current quarter marks the first time that Gillette was included in the previous year's results, so the growth will not be as strong in comparison. Hott said that reaching 7 percent organic sales growth in the quarter "would still be a great result." He said he still expects P&G's earnings to top expectations. P&G said it is confident in the long-term sales growth target of 5 percent to 7 percent. Over the coming years, P&G is also aiming to reduce its distribution sites from about 450 to 225. Chief Executive A.G. Lafley said the company is spending more time watching consumers in their homes and in stores to gain better insights. He also said that P&G's annual advertising budget of more than $8 billion is twice as high as any company in any industry. Chief Marketing Officer Jim Stengel said that there is no mandate to cut advertising as a percentage of sales, but that the company aims to spend those billions more efficiently and effectively. P&G has had successful launches where television advertising was not the leading factor, such as an upgrade to the Always feminine care line which was touted in magazines, he said. The company plans to release quarterly results on January 30. (Additional reporting by Ankur Relia in Bangalore and  Emily Kaiser  in Chicago)
