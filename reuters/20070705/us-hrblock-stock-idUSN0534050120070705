 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Tax preparer H&R Block Inc. ( HRB.N ) said the subprime mortgage unit it is selling has lost a credit line, cutting its borrowing capacity closer to the minimum needed to complete the sale of the money-losing business. 

 The news sent H&R Block shares down 2.1 percent. Investors have been hoping H&R Block will complete its sale of Option One Mortgage Corp. to private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management LP CBS.UL so that it can focus on other operations including tax preparation, its largest and most profitable business. In a late Tuesday filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Kansas City, Missouri-based H&R Block said Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. LEH.N did not renew a "warehouse" facility with Option One after it expired June 28. The facility provided at least $1 billion of borrowing capacity, according to regulatory filings. Its non-renewal left Option One with $8 billion of committed borrowing capacity and $2 billion of uncommitted capacity, H&R Block said. When it agreed in April to buy Option One, Cerberus had required the unit to maintain at least $8 billion of warehouse capacity through the closing date, still expected in October. H&R Block said it is "confident" it will do so. "There's no contractual need to go any higher," H&R Block spokesman Nick Iammartino said in an e-mailed statement. "Nor is there a business need, since that amount is more than double the estimated $3 billion to $4 billion we should have to support the day-to-day operations of Option One, given today's reduced origination volumes. It wouldn't make sense for us to spend money to maintain greater warehouse capacity than required." Nearly all of H&R Block's $808 million loss from discontinued operations in its fiscal year ended April 30 stemmed from its mortgage business, according to the company's annual report. H&R Block posted an overall net loss of $433.7 million. Separately, Bank of America Corp. ( BAC.N ) agreed to boost its warehouse credit facility to $2.25 billion from $2 billion until the sale of Option One is completed, H&R Block said. The selling price for Option One will depend on the unit's value at the time of closing. As of last month, H&R Block would have received about $800 million in a sale. Option One makes home loans to people with weaker credit histories. The value of many subprime lenders has slid as loan volumes have declined and delinquencies and defaults have risen. Dozens of subprime lenders have sold their businesses or quit the industry in the last year. H&R Block closed down 48 cents at $22.55, after earlier falling as much as 3.9 percent to $22.15.
