 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Hilton Hotels Corp. HLT.N said on Thursday that it would pay Blackstone Group LP ( BX.N ) $560 million if it receives a better offer and terminates a takeover agreement with the private equity company. 

 Blackstone, which agreed to buy Hilton for about $20 billion plus debt, would pay Hilton $660 million if it backs out of the deal, Hilton said in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Break-up fees are customary in takeover deals and are put in place to dissuade the two sides from walking away. In the filing, Hilton said Blackstone received financing commitments from a group of banks including Bear Stearns Cos. Inc. BSC.N, Bank of America Corp .( BAC.N ), Goldman Sachs Group Inc. ( GS.N ), and Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ). The filing doesn't detail the amount of debt that would be used to finance the deal. On Tuesday, Blackstone agreed to buy Hilton, the No. 2 U.S. hotel operator, for $47.50 a share in the biggest private equity buyout in the hotel industry. The offer is about 26 percent above Hilton's 25-year high of $37.82, which it hit on February 22. Hilton's shares jumped 26 percent to $45.47 on the New York Stock Exchange Thursday.
