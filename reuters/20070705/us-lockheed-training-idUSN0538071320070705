 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Lockheed Martin Corp. ( LMT.N ) has beaten L-3 Communications Holdings Inc. ( LLL.N ) to win a $1.07 billion 10-year contract for training of Air Force special operations forces and search and rescue crews. 

 Under the contract, announced on Thursday by the U.S. Defense Department on its daily contracts digest, Lockheed will provide training, hardware, software and instructors for the training of special operations forces and rescue crews. Lockheed held the previous Aircrew Training and Rehearsal Support (ATARS) contract. The follow-on contract was hotly contested. Bethesda, Maryland-based Lockheed last year filed a lawsuit against three former managers, L-3, and a subcontractor in U.S. District Court in Orlando, accusing them of conspiring to steal trade secrets related to the ATARS deal. The three former Lockheed managers all now work for L-3. According to court documents they deny any wrongdoing. New York-based L-3 subsequently filed a countersuit against Lockheed, accusing it of spreading false accusations to undermine competition for the lucrative Air Force contract. The court cases have not yet been resolved, said a Lockheed spokesman. (Reporting by  Andrea Shalal-Esa )
