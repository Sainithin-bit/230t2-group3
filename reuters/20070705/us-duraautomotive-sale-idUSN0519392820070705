 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Bankrupt U.S. auto parts maker Dura Automotive Systems Inc. DRRAQ.PK said on Thursday a private equity firm has agreed to buy its Atwood Mobile Products Inc. division for $160.2 million. 

 The deal, which needs U.S. Bankruptcy Court approval and is subject to auction should competing bids emerge, would be a key step in Dura's restructuring, the company said in a statement. Dura hopes to exit bankruptcy in the fourth quarter. Dura said Atwood Acquisition LLC, an affiliate of private equity firm Insight Equity, expects to complete the deal by the end of August. A minimum rival bid would have to exceed $166.5 million, according to court papers. The deal includes a breakup fee of 2 percent of the purchase price and expense reimbursements of up to 1 percent of the purchase price. Insight Equity aims for investments in North American-based companies with revenue of $50 million to $1 billion that are asset intensive. Its target sectors include automotive and transportation as well as manufacturing and aerospace. Dura, which filed for bankruptcy in 2006, hopes to emerge from court protection in the fourth quarter. The Rochester, Hills, Michigan-based company also plans to sell its jacks, hinge and latch businesses. Four parties submitted formal bids for Atwood and the deal was signed July 2, Dura said in court papers. Atwood operates as a separate unit of Dura, with 2006 revenue of about $330 million. It has 1,900 employees. Atwood produces windows, doors, specialty glass, water heaters, furnaces, ranges, seating and electronic controls for recreational vehicles, specialty vehicles and manufactured housing. It acquired the unit in 1999. Dura has sought a hearing July 24 in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Delaware to approve the sale and auction procedures. Bids must be submitted in writing with a 10 percent cash deposit by the end of business on August 8. An auction if necessary would be held on August 14, with a sale approval hearing scheduled for the following day.
