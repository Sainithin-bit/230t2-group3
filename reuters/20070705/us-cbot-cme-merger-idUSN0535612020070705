 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Fresh from the Independence Day holiday, Chicago Board of Trade members returned to work on Thursday expecting more fireworks in the last days of canvassing before a vote that could decide the exchange's future. 

 Shareholders of Chicago Mercantile Exchange Holdings Inc. CME.N and CBOT Holdings Inc. BOT.N are voting between now and July 9 on the proposal to merge the two largest U.S. futures marts. The deal is dominating talk on the CBOT trading floor, in nearby coffee shops and bars and in online chat rooms. The outcome is far from assured. "I'm really waiting for the last shoe to drop before deciding," said CBOT trader Glenn Hollander of Hollander & Feuerhaken, a grain merchandising firm that has been a fixture at CBOT for four generations. The Board of Trade's parent is also being sought by IntercontinentalExchange Inc. ( ICE.N ) in an unsolicited bid twice rejected by CBOT's board. As recently as Tuesday, CBOT said a resubmitted merger proposal from ICE was not superior to the CME bid. CBOT's management has repeatedly stressed operational risks in moving its huge derivatives trading volume to the relatively small ICE trading platform. THE CALEDONIA FACTOR ICE's bid values CBOT at 6 percent above CME's bid, down from about 15 percent in the days after ICE announced its plan on March 15. Both firms have beefed up their offers since then. News that CBOT's largest shareholder, Caledonia Investments Pty. Ltd., plans to vote against the CME merger seems to have made CME's task much harder. Australian-based Caledonia, which owns about 6.5 percent of CBOT shares, has said it will hold out until the Merc comes up with more money. "We think it is a low bid," Caledonia Managing Director William Vicars told Reuters in an interview from Sydney. CBOT members have been following the debate closely. "There's a large group of individual traders, like myself, who view Caledonia as our spokesman," said Kevin Ward, a floor trader for 25 years and a member/shareholder. "A bunch of people are going to do what Vicars does." Shareholding at CBOT, which made an initial public offering in 2005, remains dominated by individual floor traders and smaller member firms. Institutions only hold about a third of  CBOT. Since CBOT traders are less likely than institutions to take advice from major proxy firms, the proxy recommendations could prove less influential than in a typical merger. Some CBOT members who plan to vote "no" still seem to favor a CME deal but consider the price discovery process very much in play. Jeffrey Sprecher, ICE's chief executive, is seen as the dynamo behind a bid that has driven up CBOT's value and, one way or another, will put more money in the pocket of each Board of Trade member. But members' appetite to merge with Atlanta-based ICE, a mostly electronic exchange focused on energy and soft commodities, does not seem as great. Some fear ICE would close CBOT trading floors as soon as it could, if its bid succeeds. "There's quite a few of us that like the horse and the jockey -- the horse being the CME and the jockey being Sprecher. That creates a lot of confusion," said one veteran CBOT floor trader. CME closed up $16.34, or 3 percent, at $555.69 on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday. CBOT was up $1.90, or 0.9 percent, at $206.15, and ICE rose $2.93, or 2 percent, to $151.81.
