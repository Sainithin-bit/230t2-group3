 TORONTO  (Reuters) - DaimlerChrysler Canada DCXGn.DE 
cruised to its 11th straight monthly sales increase in June, a 
month in which sales rose at all companies that make cars in 
Canada except for General Motors ( GM.N ), company and analyst

  DaimlerChrysler said its Canadian vehicle sales jumped 24.1 
percent to 22,029.  The automaker -- which on Wednesday introduced an 
employee-pricing program on most of its 2007 models -- sold 
5,607 cars and 16,422 trucks last month.  Ford Motor Co. of Canada ( F.N ) sales rose to 25,439 
vehicles, up 0.6 percent from 25,282 in the same month of 2006, 
according to industry analyst Dennis DesRosiers.  GM, Canada's biggest automaker, said it sold 42,466 
vehicles in June, down 6.3 percent from the same month last 
year. Car sales of 20,455, down 16.3 percent, dragged on 
overall performance, while truck sales climbed 5.5 percent to 
22,011.  Both Toyota Canada Inc. ( 7203.T ) and Honda Canada Inc.

selling 20,611 vehicles in June, up 11.3 percent.  Honda said its June sales were up 16 percent at 16,907, due 
in part to record sales of its Civic and Fit models.
