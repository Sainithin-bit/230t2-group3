 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Boeing Co. ( BA.N ) booked orders for 228 planes in the second quarter, bringing its tally to 544 for the year so far, putting the U.S. planemaker on track to break last year's record. 

 The figure puts Boeing roughly level with rival Airbus, which booked a massive 425 firm orders at the Paris Air Show earlier this month, but hasn't officially updated its order book yet. Boeing took orders for 70 of its carbon-composite 787 Dreamliners in the April to June period, the first of which is set to roll out of the company's Seattle-area plant for the first time on Sunday. Airlines also ordered 22 777 minijumbos and 136 single-aisle 737s. Boeing's tally of 544 for the year so far puts the company on track to exceed last year's company record of 1,044 net orders. That allowed Boeing to reclaim the title of world's biggest-selling planemaker from Airbus, but the race this year will be tight. Airbus, a unit of European aerospace group EADS ( EAD.PA ), had 201 orders at the end of May, and snagged a massive 425 firm orders at the Paris Air Show. Its overall figure, however, will be reduced if Airbus eliminates what are essentially duplicate orders for its new A350 XWB (extra wide body), which is replacing an earlier version of the A350 that some airlines had already ordered. Airbus is set to update its online order book next week. Boeing also said on Thursday it delivered 114 commercial planes in the second quarter, making a total of 220 deliveries so far this year. That is an 18 percent increase on the 97 deliveries it made in the same quarter a year ago. At this time last year, Boeing had delivered 195 planes. Boeing is on track to hit its forecast of 440 to 445 plane deliveries this year.
