 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Eye-care company Bausch & Lomb Inc. BOL.N said on Thursday it received a takeover offer from rival Advanced Medical Optics Inc. EYE.N of $75 per share, topping its agreed $65-per-share deal to be acquired by a private equity firm. 

 Bausch & Lomb's agreement to be acquired by Warburg Pincus WP.UL for $3.67 billion in cash allowed it to solicit other offers. The bid from Advanced Medical is valued at $4.23 billion in cash and stock.
