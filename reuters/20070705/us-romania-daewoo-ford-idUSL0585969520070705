 BUCHAREST  (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co ( F.N ) has submitted the sole bid in a tendering for a majority stake in Romanian car-maker Daewoo Automobile Craiova, state privatisation agency AVAS said on Thursday. 

 "AVAS received ... only one offer, from Ford Motor Co," the agency said in a statement. Romania wants to sell a 72.4 percent stake in Daewoo Automobile Craiova. Earlier this year, Romania said it had received letters of intent from General Motors Corp. ( GM.N ) and Russian Machines, as well as Ford. The government has previously wanted to sell 95 percent of Daewoo, by adding a 22 percent stake owned by investment company SIF Oltenia SIF5.BX to the tender, but AVAS told Reuters the company has withdrawn from the sale. The agency said it will announce the bid on Friday at 13.00 p.m. (1000 GMT) at a news conference. The government bought back the troubled car-maker from its bankrupt owner Daewoo Motor in late 2006 for $51 million and paid another $10 million for debts stemming from past loans secured by the Korean company. The head of AVAS, Teodor Atanasiu, has said he envisages the buyer will have to ensure a minimum yearly output of 300,000 vehicles. Many auto parts makers have set up in the new European Union member recently, attracted by the rising output of Renault's Dacia plant, cheap labor and favorable tax rates.
