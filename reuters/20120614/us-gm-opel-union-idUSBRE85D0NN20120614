 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - General Motors ( GM.N ) and German labor union IG Metall have given themselves just over four months time to hammer out a definitive plan to restructure the loss-making operations of the U.S. carmaker's European brand Opel. 
 "The aim of the negotiations is to create a roadmap for Opel through 2016 and even beyond. I can tell you that labor is absolutely determined to reach a deal," said Oliver Burkhard, a senior IG Metall official, in an interview with Reuters on Thursday. Burkhard, who heads the region responsible for Opel's Bochum manufacturing plant, said labor would continue to push for a solution that would prevent its closure at the end of 2016. GM, IG Metall and Opel's labor leaders said they were in talks over a plan to end production at the Bochum plant over four years from now in exchange for guaranteeing German jobs through 2016.
