 ATLANTA  (Reuters) - Lowe's Companies Inc ( LOW.N ) backed its 2008 full-year forecast on Wednesday, but said it would cut store growth for next year as the soft U.S. economy and housing slump hampers demand. 

 The second-largest home improvement retailer behind Home Depot ( HD.N ) said it still expects profit of $1.48 to $1.56 a share for this year as it opens about 120 stores. But for 2009, Lowe's said it would open up to 85 new stores and expects profit of $1.40 to $1.65 a share. (Reporting by  Karen Jacobs , editing by Maureen Bavdek)
