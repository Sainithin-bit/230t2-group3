 (Reuters) - Texas oil magnate T. Boone Pickens' hedge funds have lost around $1 billion this year, including $270 million of personal losses, The Wall Street Journal said. 

 One fund focused on energy stocks was down almost 30 percent through August, the paper said adding that a smaller commodity-focused fund is down 84 percent. "It's my toughest run in 10 years," the paper quoted Pickens as saying. Pickens could not be immediately reached for comment by Reuters.
