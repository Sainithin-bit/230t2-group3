 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The Treasury's proposed $700 billion bailout for financial firms could yield a profit of at least 7 percent to 8 percent and benefit taxpayers, Bill Gross, who manages the world's biggest bond fund, wrote in an opinion piece in The Washington Post on Wednesday. 

 Gross, the chief investment officer of Pacific Investment Management Co., or Pimco, estimates the average price of distressed mortgages that pass from "troubled financial institutions" to the Treasury at auction will be 65 cents on the dollar. That will represent a loss of one-third of the original purchase price to the seller, and a prospective yield of 10 percent to 15 percent to the Treasury, Gross said. "Financed at 3 percent to 4 percent via the sale of Treasury bonds, the Treasury will therefore be in a position to earn a positive carry or yield spread of at least 7 percent to 8 percent," Gross argued. "The Treasury proposal will not be a bailout of Wall Street but a rescue of Main Street, as lending capacity and confidence is restored to our banks and the delicate balance between production and finance is given a chance to work its magic," Gross added. The last few weeks have been marked by the U.S. takeovers of mortgage companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac the government bailout of insurer American International Group Inc ( AIG.N ), the bankruptcy filing of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc LEHMQ.PK, and the pending sale of Merrill Lynch & Co Inc MER.N to Bank of America Corp ( BAC.N ). U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke are pushing Congress to approve a taxpayer-funded plan, estimated at roughly $700 billion, that would let the government buy illiquid assets from lenders. Gross' estimate of double-digit returns in scooped up mortgage securities assumes lengthy ownership of the assets and is in turn dependent on the level of home foreclosures, "but the Treasury's program is, in fact, directed to prevent just that," he added. Gross manages the $133 billion Pimco Total Return Fund and helps oversee the more than $812 billion in assets at Pimco. (Reporting by  Jennifer Ablan ; Editing by Theodore d'Afflisio)
