 HONG KONG  (Reuters) - Architects of a $700 billion bailout plan urged U.S. lawmakers to act swiftly or face dire economic consequences amid growing concern the rescue may be delayed, but markets were heartened by news that Warren Buffett was investing $5 billion in Goldman Sachs ( GS.N ). 

 In Tokyo, Kyodo news agency reported that Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group ( 8316.T ), Japan's third-largest bank, plans to invest several billion dollars in Goldman, with which it has a long relationship. SMFG said it had no plans at this time to invest in Goldman, whose spokesman Lucas van Praag said he could not confirm the Kyodo report. Stocks in Asia gained and U.S. Treasury yields rose after news of the Goldman stake purchase by one of the world's most respected investors. The MSCI index of Asian shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS edged up 0.4 percent, but Tokyo  .N225 , which was closed on Tuesday for a public holiday, fell 1.2 percent. Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway ( BRKa.N ) <BRKb. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson told lawmakers during five hours of hearings on Tuesday that the bailout was "sad" and "embarrassing," but needed to stave off a deep recession and restore confidence in markets. Andrew Barrett, managing director and strategist with Citi Private Client Investment in Hong Kong, said there is sufficient political will in Congress to approve the plan. "We believe the buyout package that has been proposed by the Treasury and the Federal Reserve will be passed, and we hope it will be passed by the end of this week. Markets will need to see this happen or we will have another leg down in the major global indices," he said. While Paulson spoke, the U.S. Federal Reserve was forced to inject another $2 billion into the troubled financial system to help mutual funds that were scrambling to raise cash to meet heavy withdrawals by rattled customers. After lawmakers scoffed at the proposed bailout's enormous size and the lack of detail, U.S. stocks closed down about 1.5 percent on uncertainty over when and how Washington would act. U.S. House Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank warned the plan might not pass until Monday, adding that the Democrat-controlled Congress needed limits on compensation for executives of firms offloading bad assets. "I just don't think the American public is sold," said David Dietze, chief investment officer at Point View Financial Services in Summit, New Jersey. "They are skeptical of the need, and they are fearful of the cost." "The skepticism is that this is going to help the Wall Street financiers and do nothing for the little guy other than saddle them with a big tax bill," he said. GOLDMAN IN SPOTLIGHT Once thought untouchable, Goldman was shaken last week by a sudden slide in its shares. Goldman and rival Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ) secured approval this week to become commercial banks. With big and well-capitalized Japanese banks investing in western peers, speculation has swirled that SMFG might invest in Goldman. SMFG shares rose 2.2 percent after the Kyodo report, outperforming a broader market that was in negative territory. SMFG spokeswoman Chika Togawa said: "At this point it is not true that we've decided to invest in Goldman Sachs." Berkshire will buy $5 billion of Goldman perpetual preferred stock that carries a 10 percent dividend. It also will receive warrants to buy $5 billion of common stock, or 43.5 million shares, at $115 per share, within five years, which could give it a roughly 9 percent stake in Goldman. Late on Tuesday, top Japanese brokerage Nomura Holdings Inc ( 8604.T ) agreed to buy bankrupt Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc's LEHMQ.PK European and Middle East operations. That came on the heels of Japan's top bank, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc ( 8306.T ), agreeing to buy up to 20 percent of Morgan Stanley. POLITICS The financial crisis has become the No. 1 issue leading up to the November 4 U.S. presidential election, and many lawmakers seeking re-election to Congress want to appear vigilant. The bailout, potentially the United States' biggest ever, could cost every American man, woman and child $2,300. Even for the world's richest country, $700 billion would be a huge budget drain. Since 2003, the Iraq war has cost about $550 billion, or a little more than $100 billion annually. Starting two days of hearings, Paulson and U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said the plan might cost less once the government is able to resell toxic mortgage securities. Paulson said the government would buy the securities in a reverse auction in which the roles of buyer and seller are reversed to ensure the lowest price is paid. U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Christopher Cox urged Congress to plug a regulatory hole in the $58 trillion market for credit default swaps, insurance-like products that many say pose a systemic risk. President George W. Bush promised in his last speech to the United Nations that markets would stabilize, but faced criticism over the excesses of what some have described as a culture of greed. 'SHARE THE OUTRAGE' Paulson, a former Goldman Sachs boss reportedly worth about $700 million, told Congress, "I share the outrage that people have. It's embarrassing for the United States of America." Sen. Charles Schumer, a New York Democrat associated with Wall Street's interests, pressed Paulson on if he could take the money in installments, starting with $150 billion. Paulson replied bluntly, "We need the full authority." "What this is about is market confidence," he said. "It's a sad story, but the American taxpayer is already on the hook." Congress and the Bush administration are under growing pressure to act following a rising tide of U.S. home foreclosures and loan defaults, and the failure of U.S. investment banks as well as the world's largest insurance company.
