 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group ( 8316.T ), Japan's third-largest bank, said it has no plans at this time to invest in U.S. investment bank Goldman Sachs ( GS.N ). 

 Kyodo news agency said earlier on Wednesday said the Japanese bank would invest several hundred billion yen in Goldman Sachs. "At this point, it is not true that we've decided to invest in Goldman Sachs," said Chika Togawa, a spokeswoman for the bank. (Reporting by  David Dolan )
