 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Stocks ended little changed on Wednesday as uncertainty about when Congress might approve a proposed $700 billion financial sector bailout offset Warren Buffett's $5 billion bet on Goldman Sachs. 

 According to the latest available data, the Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  was down 29.00 points, or 0.27 percent, to end unofficially at 10,825.17. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  was down 2.23 points, or 0.19 percent, to end unofficially at 1,185.99. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  was up 2.35 points, or 0.11 percent, to end unofficially at 2,155.68. (Reporting by  Kristina Cooke ; Editing by  Jan Paschal )
