 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve set new currency swap lines worth $30 billion with central banks in Scandinavia and Australia on Wednesday to boost short-term U.S. dollar liquidity and help drive down interbank lending rates. 

 European money markets rates eased on Wednesday after the Fed's move, but analysts questioned if the pledged $30 billion in new liquidity was enough to calm markets for long. The Fed's action comes on top of $247 billion that has already been committed to currency swaps with other major central banks, as authorities battle a global credit crunch sparked by the collapse of the U.S. subprime mortgage market last year. "These facilities, like those already in place with other central banks, are designed to improve liquidity conditions in global financial markets," the Fed said. "Central banks continue to work together during this period of market stress and are prepared to take further steps as the need arises," it said in a statement. The Fed said it had established temporary reciprocal currency swap lines of up to $10 billion each with the Reserve Bank of Australia and Sweden's Riksbank, and $5 billion swaps with Denmark's Nationalbank and Norway's Norges Bank. The Fed said the swaps were specifically aimed at addressing elevated pressures in U.S. dollar short-term funding markets. "It feels like there's a continued lack of dollars in European time," Olav Gunnes, head of Norwegian interest rate trading at Norway's biggest bank DnB NOR, told Reuters. "Nobody is certain if this is enough but every additional dollar helps." Overnight rates for U.S. dollars in Europe surged to more than 10 percent last week during the worst of the financial turmoil following the Lehman Brothers collapse. On Wednesday, dollar overnight rates in London fell to 2.6875 percent from 2.95 percent on Tuesday -- but were still well above the Fed's 2 percent target rate. Norway's has been the busiest among Scandinavian central banks, injecting both crowns and U.S. dollar currency swaps since Lehman's collapse to calm the local money market, which stopped functioning at one point last week. One-day crown rates fell to 6.25 percent at Wednesday's daily fixing from 6.91 percent on Tuesday but remained well above the central bank's 5.75 percent target. Michael Grahn, an analyst at Danske Markets in Stockholm, said the Fed measure appeared to be more of a "framework for future action" rather than anything "up and running right now." Swedish one-day rates eased slightly to 5.268 percent on Wednesday from Tuesday's 5.288 percent. "It's also uncertain if $10 billion (allotted to Sweden) will be enough," he added. Norway and Sweden did not detail the timing of their swap injections, while Denmark's central bank said it would auction 28-day dollar liquidity on Friday. FLEXIBILITY BOOST Central banks in Norway and Denmark said the swap line would boost their flexibility in money market operations, while the head of Sweden's authority said the move was precautionary. "This agreement provides Norges Bank with additional flexibility to address, if needed, rapidly evolving developments in financial markets," the governor of Norway's central bank, Svein Gjedrem, said in a statement. Swedish Riksbank Governor Stefan Ingves said his country's financial system was stable and its banks solvent. "Sweden has been affected by the renewed wave of international financial unrest," he said. "We are following these developments closely and are working closely together with Swedish banks, market participants and government agencies." The Reserve Bank of Australia didn't comment on the currency swaps other than to repeat the Fed statement on its website. The Fed has already set up a $110 billion swap line with the European Central Bank, $60 billion with the Bank of Japan, $40 billion with the Bank of England, $27 billion with the Swiss National Bank, and $10 billion with the Bank of Canada. The Fed authorized the swaps until January 20, 2009. (Reporting by  Alister Bull ,  Wojciech Moskwa  and  Simon Johnson , Editing by Leslie Adler and Neil Fullick)
