 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc's investment and lending group -- which includes the bank's bets with its own money -- accounted for nearly 30 percent of pre-tax earnings in the first three quarters of 2010, according to a regulatory filing. 

 The results are the broadest indication yet of how much Goldman relies on betting its own money, either through trading or investing in funds. The bank earned $2.76 billion before taxes from the investment and lending group in the first three quarters of 2010, out of total pre-tax earnings of $9.42 billion, according to the filing.
