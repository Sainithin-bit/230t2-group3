 (Reuters) - A former technology analyst with Primary Global Research pleaded guilty on Tuesday to leaking confidential company information to hedge funds, in part of the U.S. government's widening probe into insider trading. 

 A list of some of the people involved is below. BOB NGUYEN Nguyen, a former technology analyst with expert network firm Primary Global Research pleaded guilty to criminal offenses and agreed to cooperate in an investigation. In his plea on Tuesday, he said one of the goals of the firm was to recruit experts at companies to provide material nonpublic information. Nguyen worked for Primary Global from January 2008 to February 2010. WALTER SHIMOON Shimoon, who was arrested in December, was a senior director of business development at Flextronics International, and is accused of providing confidential information to a hedge fund about Flextronics and Apple Inc, according to a criminal complaint. He is out on bail. MARK ANTHONY "TONY" LONGORIA Longoria, a Round Rock, Texas-based supply chain manager for Advanced Micro Devices Inc, was arrested in December and is accused of providing confidential details about revenue and sales to a hedge fund. He was also a consultant for Primary Global and is out on bail. JAMES FLEISHMAN Fleishman, 41, of Santa Clara, California was an account executive responsible for attracting new clients to Primary Global Research. He was arrested in December on charges that he arranged for hedge funds to speak to consultants, knowing the consultants would provide inside information to the funds. He has been placed on leave by Primary Global and remains free on bail. MANOSHA KARUNATILAKA Karunatilaka, was a manager at Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co North America in Massachusetts, and is accused of having a conversation with a technology analyst at a financial firm in which he provided material nonpublic information about his company and its customers. Karunatilaka was also a consultant for Primary Global from 2007 to 2010, and his role at Taiwan Semiconductor included forecasting, planning, sales and marketing, according to a Primary Global document. He was arrested in December. WINIFRED JIAU Jiau, 43, was arrested last month, as prosecutors accused her of selling inside information about publicly traded companies including computer chipmakers Marvell Technology Group Ltd and Nvidia Corp to hedge funds. Jiau worked as a consultant for expert network firm Primary Global Research, according to details in the complaint. She is still being held in custody in California after being denied bail. KARL MOTEY Motey, an independent technology consultant at Coda Group Inc in Los Altos, California, pleaded guilty to charges of conspiracy and securities fraud last year and is cooperating with prosecutors. He made phone calls to gather evidence for prosecutors, including confidential information from sources at Marvell Technology and had obtained insider information from a source at United Microelectronics Corp according to court documents. DANIEL DEVORE DeVore, a global supply manager at Dell Computer, is cooperating with the probe. He has pleaded guilty to securities fraud in connection with his work as an "expert network" consultant for Primary Global Research, Guidepoint Global and Vista, according to court papers. DON CHING TRANG CHU Chu, an executive at California research firm Primary Global Research, was arrested in November on charges that he introduced hedge funds to executives who gave them insider trading information. Primary Global said it has cut ties with Chu, who had worked as a Taiwan Liaison at Primary Global. RICHARD CHOO-BENG LEE Lee pleaded guilty in 2009 in the insider-trading prosecution of Galleon Group hedge fund founder Raj Rajaratnam and 22 other traders. Lee, who once worked for hedge fund SAC Capital, was identified as a cooperating witness in some of the recent complaints. DR. YVES BENHAMOU Benhamou, a French infectious disease specialist, was arrested in November on charges of passing illegal tips about negative results in an experimental Human Genome Sciences Inc drug trial to FrontPoint, a hedge fund owned by Morgan Stanley. Benhamou's bail was set at $3 million. FrontPoint, after facing big redemptions, elected to shut down the healthcare funds linked to the scandal. [ID:nNN17195473] Benhamou does not appear to be linked to the recent arrests, but was affiliated with an expert network as well. JOHN KINNUCAN Kinnucan is the owner of a Portland, Oregon-based technology research firm who was contacted by two FBI agents last year and asked to wear a wire for the U.S. government. He refused to cooperate and sent an e-mail to clients the next day warning them that an investigation was under way. He has been subpoenaed as part of the probe, but has not been charged with a crime or arrested. (Reporting by  Emily Chasan ; Editing by  Tim Dobbyn )
