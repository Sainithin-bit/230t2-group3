 SYDNEY  (Reuters) - Qantas Airways will resume Airbus A380 flights between Australia and Los Angeles from January 16, the airline said on Tuesday. 

 Qantas said in a statement the decision followed extensive consultation with engine maker Rolls-Royce, aircraft manufacturer Airbus and the Australia's Civil Aviation Authority. Qantas was forced to initially ground its fleet of A380 aircraft after an engine in one of the aircraft disintegrated mid-flight in November. It has since resumed some A380 flights but was not flying the aircraft on the route to and from Los Angeles, which had required the use of maximum engine thrust on takeoff.
