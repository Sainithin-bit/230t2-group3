 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank President Narayana Kocherlakota said the time is not right to start tightening monetary policy now, saying he is "comfortable" with the Fed's currency ultra-easy stance. 

 "The situation I described, with ongoing disinflation and the high rate of unemployment, is such that this is not the time to start (tightening)," he said at an event in Madison, Wisconsin. "But that's the question we have to confront in 2011 and thereafter. If we haven't started in 2011, we will have to confront it afterwards." (Reporting by  Ann Saphir )
