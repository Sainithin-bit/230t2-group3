 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Nobel Biocare Holding AG NOBN.VX may be worth 30 percent to 50 percent more than its current share price according to a Barron's April 7 story, citing a investor's estimated value for the company. 

 The dental implant supplier's share price's "fair value is 30 percent to 50 percent higher" according to a Barron's quote attributed to Jeff McCormack an analyst at Manning & Napier, a Nobel investor. Barron's cited moves for change by Chief Executive Domenico Scala, who was appointed last fall, growth in the dental implant market and prospects for Nobel becoming a takeover target as factors that could boost its share price. Nobel shares, which split 5-for-1 on Thursday, are at 49 Swiss francs ($48.69) from a year-ago high of 91.40 Swiss francs, the story said.
