 BRDO, Slovenia  (Reuters) - Europe will press the G7 group of industrialized economies next week to demand more disclosure from banks on their securitization activities and the exotic securities behind the global credit crunch. 

 Finance ministers and central bankers from the 15 euro zone countries also agreed at talks in Slovenia to express concern over excessive exchange rate volatility at a meeting on Friday of the Group of Seven -- the United States, Japan, Canada, Britain and, from the euro zone, Germany, France and Italy. There were fewer of the complaints sometimes heard from some nations, above all France, about the damage a strong euro does to euro zone exports. Ministers instead said inflation was the big worry and that a strong euro helps limit the import bill for oil and other dollar-priced commodities. European Central Bank chief Jean-Claude Trichet stated the line on currency policy as follows: "Excessive volatility is counter-productive from the standpoint of growth, global growth. I would say the recent excessive moves are an element of concern, and I appreciate enormously the fact that the U.S. authorities, the President, the Secretary of the Treasury and my friend (Federal Reserve Chairman) Ben Bernanke say that a strong dollar is in the interests of the U.S. economy." FINANCIAL MARKET INSTABILITY In a statement issued from a two-day meeting which ended on Saturday, the Europeans said they were starting to see signs of "negative spillovers to the real economy" from financial market turmoil that snowballed out of the United States last August. "To increase transparency and restore confidence, ministers and (central bank) governors call on financial institutions to make full and immediate disclosure of on- and off-balance-sheet risk exposures and losses," the statement said. It noted varying practices on disclosure and said it was time to consider extra guidelines by mid-2008, adding that regulation may be needed if the financial industry fails to go far enough in proposals on transparency they are due to produce by June. The financial market turmoil began last year with defaults on U.S. home loans and spread through the financial system via complex credit derivative products which were packaged, bought and sold by the world's major financial institutions. securitization has long existed but got increasingly exotic in recent years with the development of new instruments that farm debt out to investors in the form of asset-backed securities that lie at the heart of the credit crunch. During two days of meetings in Slovenia which started with the 15 countries of the euro zone and then widened to all 27 countries of the European Union, the basic message was Europe was doing its bit to address market turmoil and had a sounder financial supervisory system than the United States. The ministers discussed practical steps to improve oversight of cross-border banks and deal with market turmoil, even if the idea of a pan-EU supervisory agency is so far a non-starter due to concerns in various capitals of a loss of sovereignty. Dutch central bank chief Nout Wellink, who also heads the global Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, said "a really long list" of recommendations to boost the stability of the financial system would be put to the G7 meeting. Those recommendations are to be presented by the Financial Stability Forum, which was created after financial crises in Asia in the late 1990s and is now attempting to coordinate the regulatory responses to the latest turmoil. Among things discussed for that report is a worst-case scenario in which the authorities could have to consider steps as drastic as bank bailouts and mortgage repurchases with public money, according to officials who spoke to Reuters last week. Beyond that, another potential proposals on a long FSF list is the idea of getting a big group of the important banks to disclose their financial positions at the same time and according to a "common template". Wellink was less specific. "We will address transparency issues. We will deal with the rating agencies. We will also pay attention to cooperation between supervisors and central banks," he said. "What we try to address is the underpinnings of the originate and distribute model. These underpinnings should be strengthened," Wellink said, speaking to reporters at the end of the Slovenia meetings. The "originate and distribute model" is the classic investment banking model of constructing packages of securities and selling them to a range of investors. In another document, the Europeans made it clear bailouts were the last of last resorts. "The use of public money to resolve a crisis can never be taken for granted and will only be considered to remedy a serious disturbance in the economy and when overall social benefits are assessed to exceed the cost of recapitalisation at public expense," said the document, something they described as a memorandum of understanding on financial security principles. IMF REJIG The EU also issued a statement expressing its approval of a recent agreement that gives countries like China and India more voting rights within the International Monetary Fund. "(The) reform will achieve a significant shift in the representation of dynamic economies, many of which are emerging market countries, and give poorer countries a greater say in running the multilateral institution," said the statement. The plan would boost the voting shares of emerging economic powers China, India and Brazil. At the same time, it will reduce that of countries like Russia and Argentina, as well as slightly lower those of the Germany, Britain, France and others. IMF Managing Director Dominique Strauss-Kahn said late last month that all but five of the IMF's 24-member board members backed the changes. Egypt, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Russia and Argentina either voted against it or abstained. (Writing by Brian Love; Editing by  Nick Edwards )
