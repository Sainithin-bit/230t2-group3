 MELBOURNE  (Reuters) - BHP Billiton, the world's biggest miner, reported a 47 percent rise in second-half profit on Wednesday, in line with analysts' forecasts, after a sharp rebound in iron ore and copper prices. 

 BHP, which has made a $39 billion hostile bid for top global fertilizer maker Potash Corp, said it was cautious on the short-term global outlook and that the Chinese economy, its biggest customer, would slow from recent highs. Net profit before one-offs for January-June rose to $6.77 billion from $4.59 billion a year earlier, compared with analysts' forecasts for around $6.9 billion, according to a survey of 13 international brokers. BHP is targeting Potash Corp with a $130 a share offer to power its next phase of growth, launching into a completely new market for the global miner, which has made some of its shareholders nervous. BHP shares have dropped 6.8 percent since announcing the bid a week ago, heavily underperforming a 2.6 percent fall in rival Rio Tinto, as investors are worried about the risks BHP is taking on with the bid.
