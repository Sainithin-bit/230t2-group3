 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - A commission appointed by President Barack Obama to study the causes of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill gives academics and environmentalists a prominent role in making recommendations about the future of offshore drilling in the United States. 

 The seven-member commission is tasked with examining root causes of BP's Deepwater Horizon explosion, and what should be done to prevent future spills. It is slated to hold its second public meeting on Wednesday. The panel is co-chaired by Bob Graham, a former Florida governor and long-time Democratic senator, and William Reilly, a former head of the Environmental Protection Agency who now runs an investment group for water projects and companies. Reilly, a Republican, has taken a leave of absence as a member of the board of directors of oil major ConocoPhillips for the duration of the commission's investigation. Following are Obama's other appointees: DONALD BOESCH Boesch, a biological oceanographer and Louisiana native, is a pioneer in the study of the long-term impact of offshore oil and gas development and its environmental implications for the Gulf of Mexico. He has served as a science advisor to many U.S. government agencies and international programs. Boesch is president of the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science. In an online opinion piece for the Washington Post, Boesch criticized "the political jockeying in Congress" that he says has held up passage of a comprehensive energy bill to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. TERRY GARCIA Garcia is executive vice president for mission programs at the National Geographic Society, the world's largest scientific and educational institution. His responsibilities include managing the Committee for Research and Exploration, which funded the work of Jacques Cousteau and Jane Goodall. As general counsel for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Garcia was in charge of implementing the Exxon Valdez oil spill restoration plan to bring resources and services back to Prince William Sound and the Gulf of Alaska after the 1989 oil spill. He later became deputy administrator of NOAA and assistant secretary of commerce for oceans and atmosphere at the Commerce Department. During his tenure, he coordinated programs to protect endangered species, conserve wildlife habitats and develop the national marine sanctuary system. CHERRY MURRAY Murray was named dean of Harvard University's School of Engineering and Applied Sciences last year after leading some of the nation's top scientists and engineers in previous roles at Bell Laboratories and the Energy Department's Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. She is an expert in condensed matter and materials physics, phase transitions, light scattering and surface physics, including the study of soft condensed matter and complex fluids. Her expertise has landed her positions on more than 80 national and international scientific advisory committees, governing boards and National Research Council panels. Murray was named one of the "50 Most Important Women in Science" by Discover Magazine in 2002. FRANCES ULMER Ulmer has spent more than 30 years in public service, shaping public and environmental policy -- 18 of them as an elected official. She became mayor of Juneau, Alaska, in 1983, has served as a state representative and was the first female lieutenant governor of Alaska. Ulmer served as Alaska's director of policy development, during when she directed coastal management. Ulmer is chancellor of the University of Alaska Anchorage, the state's largest public university, is a member of the Aspen Institute's Commission on Arctic Climate Change and sits on the board of the Alaska Nature Conservancy, the National Parks Conservation Association and the Union of Concerned Scientists. Ulmer, who has a law degree, has also been a fellow at the Institute of Politics at the Kennedy School of Government. FRANCES BEINECKE For 35 years, Beinecke has worked with the Natural Resources Defense Council, a nonprofit aimed at protecting wildlife and the environment. After becoming NDRC's president in 2006, Beinecke focused its resources on curbing climate change, reducing U.S. dependence on oil and protecting oceans. With a rare books library named after her family on Yale's campus, Beinecke was among the first graduating class at Yale that included women. Beinecke co-founded the New York League of Conservation Voters with her husband, Paul Elston. The couple's three daughters are all activists for the NRDC.
