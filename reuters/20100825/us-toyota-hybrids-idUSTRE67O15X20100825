 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp said on Wednesday it wants to reach cumulative sales of 5 million hybrid vehicles in the early part of this decade. 

 Toyota, the pioneer in gasoline-electric hybrid vehicles, said earlier this month it had sold more than 2.68 million hybrid vehicles globally since it launched the first model in 1997. The best-selling Prius and other models have received a boost in Japan especially in the last year thanks to government subsidies that favor hybrids over other fuel-efficient cars. Toyota has a goal of selling at least 1 million hybrid vehicles a year in the early part of this decade, and plans to introduce a hybrid option across its whole lineup as early as possible in the 2020s. Under a five-year environmental action plan to run through 2015 and released on Wednesday, the world's biggest automaker also said it would improve its vehicles' average fuel efficiency in all regions by 25 percent compared with 2005 levels.
