 PARIS/LONDON  (Reuters) - L'Oreal ( OREP.PA ) and Total ( TOTF.PA ) have reservations about plans to buy Genzyme GENZ.O by drug company Sanofi-Aventis ( SASY.PA ), in which they are top shareholders, and do not want it to overpay, bankers said. 

 Both the cosmetics group and the oil major "will have a view on not spending too much money," one banker close to L'Oreal said, adding L'Oreal was not opposed in principle to a deal but was not sure Genzyme was the best buy. Sanofi, Total and L'Oreal declined to comment. (Additional reporting by  James Regan  and Pascale Denis in Paris; Jessica Hall in Philadelphia; and Ben Hirschler in London)
