 NEW DELHI  (Reuters) - State-run Oil and Natural Gas Corp ( ONGC.BO ), GAIL India ( GAIL.BO ) and Oil India ( OILI.BO ) will not make a counterbid against Vedanta Resources' ( VED.L ) $9.6 billion stake purchase in Cairn India ( CAIL.BO ), a senior official in India's oil ministry told Reuters. 

 "There is no chance for a counterbid by Indian firms as the valuation done by Vedanta for Cairn India is already very high," the official said on Wednesday. He declined to be named as he was not authorized to speak publicly. Last week, India-focused miner Vedanta said it agreed to spend up to $9.6 billion to buy a majority stake in Cairn India from its UK-based parent Cairn Energy ( CNE.L ). Previously, an oil ministry source had said all options were open for Indian state-run firms on Cairn India and domestic media reported the firms had held informal talks on a joint bid. ONGC, Oil India and GAIL declined comment on Wednesday. Some analysts said the official's comments did not necessarily mean Vedanta had a clear shot at the deal. "The threat of a counterbid seems to have reduced, but I think the market will be satisfied only if they (the government) come straight out and say it publicly," said Deepak Pareek, sector analyst with Angel Broking. "There is still speculation on this despite what the sources are saying," he said. "But I think the government will weigh whether the $10 billion or so needed for the counterbid cannot be better utilized in securing India's energy security by buying assets globally," Pareek said. GOVERNMENT APPROVAL The deal needs Indian government approval because Cairn India has production-sharing contracts (PSCs) with the government for oil and gas exploration blocks and the agreement says any ownership change would need federal approval. By 0940 GMT, Cairn India shares were down 3 percent on the Bombay Stock Exchange after rising more than 3 percent on Tuesday on market talk of a counterbid by state firms. Approval from state-run explorer ONGC, which has a 30 percent stake in Cairn India's oil block called RJ-ON-90/1 in the western Indian state of Rajasthan, is also crucial for any change of ownership. India's trade minister said on Tuesday Oil and Natural Gas Corp should have a say in the deal. Vedanta, in its first move into the energy sector, is buying a controlling stake in India's No. 4 oil and gas company from Cairn Energy to capitalize on rising energy demand, economic growth and an expanding population. On Tuesday, the Indian government rejected a plan by Vedanta to mine bauxite in an eastern state over environmental concerns, a blow to the firm already facing hurdles to its planned energy deal in the country. Cairn Energy Chairman Bill Gammell arrived in New Delhi last week and held talks with Indian officials on the acquisition. Vedanta has offered 405 rupees a share for between 40 and 51 percent of Cairn India. The final stake bought would depend on the response to an open offer for a 20 percent stake made to minority shareholders at 355 rupees a share. That offer opens on October 11.
