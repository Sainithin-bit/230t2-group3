 PARIS  (Reuters) - PSA Peugeot Citroen ( PEUP.PA ) and Ford ( F.N ) will phase out their cooperation in some diesel engines, the companies said on Thursday. 
 "The two companies have decided to independently develop and manufacture their larger diesel engines," Paris-based Peugeot said in a joint statement with the U.S. car maker. Announcing plans in February for a broad-based alliance with Ford's Detroit-based rival General Motors ( GM.N ), Peugeot had said the tie-up would not affect existing partnerships including joint diesel-engine production with Ford. Peugeot and Ford will continue to cooperate on smaller diesels and a new generation of engines developed to meet new European emissions rules entering into force in 2014, the companies said.
