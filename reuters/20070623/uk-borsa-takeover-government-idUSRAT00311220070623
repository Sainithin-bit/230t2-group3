 ROME  (Reuters) - Italian Economy Minister Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa lent his support to the London Stock Exchange's ( LSE.L ) takeover deal with Borsa Italiana, calling it "very positive". 

 "This is a very positive accord because it creates a very strong international presence," Padoa-Schioppa said. He added the deal was part of "the important process of international strengthening of Italian financial institutions".
