 KUWAIT  (Reuters) - Citibank ( C.N ) has made offers to shareholders in Gulf Bank ( GBKK.KW ) to buy a significant stake in the Kuwaiti lender, a newspaper said on Saturday. 

 Gulf bank shares rose 2.35 percent to 1.740 dinars ($6.04) after the report. Al-Qabas newspaper said Citibank had offered to pay 2.5 dinars per share. It did not disclose the source of the report or say how much of a stake Citibank was seeking to buy. The paper said Citibank wanted to boost its presence in Kuwait, where it has an office. Its current focus in Kuwait on corporate financing and private wealth management promised only limited growth, the paper said. Gulf Bank declined to comment on the report. Citibank officials could not be reached for comment.
