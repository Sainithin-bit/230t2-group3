 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Dow Jones & Co. delivered a proposal to safeguard its editorial independence to News Corp. on Friday, the first step in a negotiation about a possible News Corp. takeover, according to the online edition of the Wall Street Journal. 

 The proposal calls for a Special Committee on Editorial and Journalistic Integrity and would limit News Corp.'s ability to control the Wall Street Journal brand.
