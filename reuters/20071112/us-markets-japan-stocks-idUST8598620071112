 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japan's Nikkei average hit its lowest level this year on Monday, hurt by exporters including Honda Motor Co Ltd following the yen's sharp rise against the dollar and big losses on Wall Street. 

 The dollar fell as low as 110.22 yen on Monday morning, the lowest since 108.97 yen hit in May 2006. It was around 110.55 yen as of 0048 GMT. "It will inflict a big damage on exporters, many of which have forecast the dollar to average 115 yen," said Norihiro Fujito, general manager of the investment research and information division at Mitsubishi UFJ Securities. "Fundamentals will be affected. We now have to be on alert for downside risks of Japanese companies' second-half earnings." As of 0049 GMT, the Nikkei average was down 2.6 percent at 15,174.04, its lowest since August 7 last year. The broader TOPIX shed 2.7 percent to 1,454.72, lowest since June 14. Honda fell 3.6 percent to 3,770 yen. Canon Inc lost 3.1 percent to 5,410 yen and Toyota Motor Corp shed 1.6 percent to 6,050 yen. Japan's three largest banks were also down. Mizuho Financial Group Inc, extending losses, was down 5.5 percent at 502,000 yen. The bank lost 5.7 percent on Friday after the Nikkei business daily reported its unlisted brokerage arm may post a subprime-related loss of over 100 billion yen ($906 million).
