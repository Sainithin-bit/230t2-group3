 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Blackstone Group ( BX.N ) President and Chief Operating Officer Hamilton James said on Monday bank executives don't have a clear picture of how the mortgage "black hole" would play out. 

 James, who was speaking on a conference call to analysts after announcing quarterly results, added that only 15 percent to 20 percent of bank losses were related to leverage finance, with the remainder being mortgage related.
