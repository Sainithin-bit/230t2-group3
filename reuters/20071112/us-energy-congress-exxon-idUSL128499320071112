 ROME  (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp ( XOM.N ) on Monday blamed supply tightness together with strong demand and a weak dollar for high oil prices and said the oil market was likely to stay much the same in 2008. 

 Exxon Mobil Chief Executive Rex Tillerson said that while he expected supply to catch up with demand in two to three years, the longer term outlook for oil depended on resource-rich nations opening up their countries for investments. "It is not a resource problem. The world has plenty of oil," Tillerson told reporters at the World Energy Congress in Rome. "It is an issue of whether or not the investment dollars, technology and the know-how to develop those resources in an efficient way and a reliable way ...is going to be brought to bear on those resources." Oil hit a record high of $98.62 a barrel last week. While it has eased since, it remains within reach of $100. In his speech to the congress Tillerson launched a scathing attack on the rising trend of "resource nationalism", calling it a major barrier to innovation and development of new energy resources. Emboldened by rising prices, countries such as Russia, Venezuela and Ecuador are seeking more cash and control from western companies that drill in their oil and gas fields. Many of them have either booted out western oil companies or sought to renegotiate earlier contracts. Venezuela earlier this year pushed out Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips as part of a nationalization drive after they failed to strike a deal to stay in multibillion-dollar projects. "Unfortunately, current conditions and emerging challenges have led some to pursue isolationist or protectionist energy policies which could have severe consequences for the global economy and for global energy security over the longer term," Tillerson said. He added that people in resource-rich countries would ultimately bear the "long-term costs of such counterproductive policies". The Exxon Mobil CEO also said talks to settle a dispute between Western oil groups and the Kazakh government in the giant Kashagan oil field, the world's biggest oil discovery in three decades, were "very active". Kazakhstan has criticized Exxon and its partners -- Italy's ENI ( ENI.MI ), Anglo-Dutch Royal Dutch Shell ( RDSa.L ) and France's Total ( TOTF.PA ) -- for delays and cost overruns and demanded billions of dollars in compensation. It has also called for a bigger role for state oil company KazMunaiGas RDGZ.KZ and has set November 30 as the final deadline in its talks with the western firms. When asked if the partners were likely to give KazMunaiGas an increased stake in the field, or whether the government would be satisfied with simply a cash settlement, Tillerson said: "Those talks are very active in all of the areas you touched on." He refused to give further details. (Writing by Santosh Menon, editing by Elizabeth Fullerton)
