 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The sale of Wendy's International Inc WEN.N may be in jeopardy because of continued turmoil in the credit markets, potentially forcing the restaurant company to delay a deal, the New York Times reported, citing sources close to the situation. 

 Buyers are concerned that the financing provided by Wendy's banks, JP Morgan Chase ( JPM.N ) and Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc LEH.N, is highly conditional and includes several details that are unattractive to potential buyers, a person briefed on the sales process told the Times. The banks sent a term sheet for financing to prospective buyers two weeks ago but have not made formal commitments, the person told the newspaper. The Times also said the financing includes an escape hatch that would allow the banks to withdraw financing if the credit markets deteriorate. The hamburger chain might seek more time for its banks to line up other financing, a person briefed on its plans told the Times. Representatives from the company were not immediately available for comment. (Reporting by  Justin Grant ; Editing by Quentin Bryar)
