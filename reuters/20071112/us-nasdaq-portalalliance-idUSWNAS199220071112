 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Twelve Wall Street firms that had launched competing platforms for trading unregistered securities known as 144a issues have agreed to cooperate on a single platform operated by the Nasdaq Stock Market ( NDAQ.O ), the exchange said on Monday. 

 Companies are increasingly turning to private investors, known as qualified institutional buyers with at least $100 million in assets, to raise capital through 144a offerings without the regulatory burden of a public offering. In recent months, many securities firms had launched their own 144a platforms, including Goldman Sachs' ( GS.N ) GSTrUE and OPUS-5, started by a group of five banks including Citigroup Inc ( C.N ), Merrill Lynch MER.N and Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc LEH.N. Nasdaq launched its own portal market earlier this year to trade these private placements of stock. Nasdaq data show the private-placement market reached $162 billion last year, outpacing the $154 billion value of overall U.S. public offerings. "Investors and issuers will benefit from a unified facility that includes trading, shareholder tracking, clearance and settlement," said Nasdaq Chief Executive Bob Greifeld in a statement. Bank of America ( BAC.N ), Bear Stearns BSC.N, Citigroup, Credit Suisse ( CSGN.VX ), Deutsche Bank ( DBKGn.DE ), Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan ( JPM.N ), Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ), UBS ( UBSN.VX ) and Wachovia WB.N will join forces with Nasdaq's market to form the Portal Alliance.
