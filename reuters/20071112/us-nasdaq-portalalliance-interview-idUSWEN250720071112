 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Nasdaq's ( NDAQ.O ) new 144a portal alliance market, a joint effort between the second-largest U.S. stock exchange and 12 Wall Street firms, will bring strong growth in trading volume of unregistered securities in the next few years, Chief Executive Bob Greifeld said on Monday. 

 "We'll have great growth stats in the years to come with respect to the volume of trading," Greifeld said in an interview. Greifeld also said he is confident about obtaining regulatory approval for Nasdaq's deal with Middle East exchange operator Borse Dubai. The deal is expected to close in the first quarter of 2008.
