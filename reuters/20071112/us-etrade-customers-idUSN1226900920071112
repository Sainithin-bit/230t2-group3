 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Online brokerage E*Trade Financial Corp ( ETFC.O ) on Monday told its customers that it remains well-capitalized under regulatory standards, but that market conditions are likely to get worse before improving. 

 "As a matter of fact, we could absorb an immediate write down in excess of $1 billion and still remain well capitalized," E*Trade President and Chief Operating Officer Jarrett Lilien said in a message to customers posted on the company's Web site, E*Trade shares sank 50 percent on Monday amid speculation that credit losses could fuel an exodus by depositors and plunge the broker -- which has a large online banking business -- into bankruptcy. Lilien also acknowledged that because "news in the market" will get worse before it gets better, E*Trade is taking "prudent measures" to manage its balance sheet. (Reporting by  Joseph A.
