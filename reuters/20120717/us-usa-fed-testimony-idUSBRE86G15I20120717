 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke was set to repeat on Wednesday to a House of Representatives' panel remarks on the economy and monetary policy that he delivered to a Senate committee on Tuesday. 
 A copy of the testimony as prepared for delivery to the House Financial Services Committee was posted to committee's Web site and, outside of a brief introduction, appeared identical to the prepared remarks Bernanke delivered on Tuesday. (Reporting by Timothy Ahmann)
