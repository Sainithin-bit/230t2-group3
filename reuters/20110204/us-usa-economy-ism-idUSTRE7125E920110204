 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The U.S. services sector grew in January at its fastest pace since August 2005, according to an industry report released on Thursday. 

 The Institute for Supply Management said its index of national non-manufacturing activity rose to 59.4 in January from 57.1 in December. The median forecast of 68 economists surveyed by Reuters was for a reading of 57.0. A reading below 50 indicates contraction in the sector, while a number above 50 means expansion. The reading marked the non-manufacturing sector's 14th straight month of growth. The better-than-expected reading chimes with the ISM's twin report on Tuesday, which showed the manufacturing sector grew at its fasted pace in nearly seven years. The services report's prices paid component rose to 72.1 from 69.5, while new orders rose to 64.9 from 61.4, mirroring strength in the manufacturing sector. The employment component rose to 54.5 from 52.6 and was at its highest level since May 2006. (Reporting by  Edward Krudy ; Editing by  Padraic Cassidy )
