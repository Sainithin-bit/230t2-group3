 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - Germany and France proposed a competitiveness pact for Europe on Friday and EU leaders discussed strengthening a euro zone rescue fund, hoping to win back market confidence in the bloc's public finances. 

 Following are comments by EU leaders after the summit: GERMAN CHANCELLOR ANGELA MERKEL: "There is agreement that we should have a competitiveness pact. We haven't spoken yet about concrete steps. That will be a task for the Council between March 9 and 24." "We want to achieve a new quality of economic coordination in the euro zone, that is also open to others." "Even in March this won't be a finished process. We should have one, two, three, four, a few points that we agree to implement within a year, so that there isn't a feeling in Europe that all we do is talk and rarely act." EUROPEAN COUNCIL PRESIDENT HERMAN VAN ROMPUY: ON GERMAN/FRENCH SUGGESTIONS: "(Chancellor) Merkel and others didn't put forward any specific proposals, any tangible measures." "What we are doing is to some extent revolutionary." ON ECONOMIC GOVERNANCE AND COORDINATION: "There were no concrete proposals proposed. Most of the discussion was on the draft conclusions I sent out yesterday evening that we had prepared the days before. "So it is a decision on procedure, a decision that we all want, and that is beyond doubt by all the members of the European Council and those that are interested in it. "We are again on the principle of strengthening the economic coordination beyond what we decided already in the task force and in the six legislative proposals of the Commission. "So there was a broad agreement to strengthen that economic coordination and that economic governance. "We discussed it, not in depth, the kind of proposals, and there was certainly not a proposal by France and Germany, not a concrete proposal. It was more a discussion on procedure, how to handle all this or how to organize all this." ON SUMMIT PREPARATIONS: "So we will take decisions in March, at the European Council in March. President Barroso and I will prepare all this by consultations. We will make proposals how to get things ahead, and it is likely that there will be summit of the heads of state of the euro zone in the course of March, but only on that topic of economic coordination. We will take this up again at the European Council of March 24. "So it was not a discussion on concrete proposals, not at all." ON ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: "The outlook has substantially improved, including in the euro zone countries which were in difficulties recently. "We are aware there is still aware a lot of homework to do, it is not a time for complacency. We will draw the lessons from the crisis. "We decided to use the momentum to adopt a comprehensive package in March." EU COMMISSION PRESIDENT JOSE MANUAL BARROSO: ON COMPETITIVENESS: "It is extremely positive that member states are committing to a comprehensive agenda and that they recognize that more convergence is necessary to achieve this higher level of competitiveness." "We are going to complete of course the initiatives that were already taken in terms of governance." "We are ready to go further, namely in the euro area. The euro area confirmed its commitment to implement this comprehensive package. I believe the deepening and reinforcing of economic policies in the euro area will also strengthen our response to the crisis." FRENCH PRESIDENT NICOLAS SARKOZY: ON DISCUSSIONS WITH GERMANY: "The idea we have with (Germany's) Angela Merkel is not to impose the same thing on everybody (...) but maybe we can agree on how to calculate things. "It's not about saying there is no specificity... but to try to agree on a common base." ON CORPORATE TAX RATES: "Maybe we can agree on a common framework, which does not mean pure equality." "It's not a rigid process." EUROGROUP CHAIRMAN JEAN-CLAUDE JUNCKER: "In no way is it acceptable that people are working 35 hours in one country and 43 hours in another country." "The Belgian prime minister and myself were rejecting indexation of wages." EARLIER COMMENTS: FRENCH PRESIDENT NICOLAS SARKOZY AND GERMAN CHANCELLOR ANGELA MERKEL AT A NEWS CONFERENCE SARKOZY: "We are working hand in glove, France and Germany, with a clear, total determination to support the euro, to defend the euro." "We want to strengthen the competitiveness of Europe and its economy. "We want to ensure the convergence of different European economies and we have further strengthened our discussions on this matter in the past few weeks. We therefore agree on a structural plan that is designed to respond to the challenges that Europe faces." "This response means more integration of our economic policies, with the aim of strengthening the competitiveness of our economies." MERKEL: "Germany and France will make it very obvious that we intend to defend the euro as a currency -- that is only what is to be expected -- but we also want to defend it as a political project." "What we want is to ensure is to safeguard prosperity and wealth for the people in our countries. But we must increase our competitiveness, and the yardstick or benchmark should be the member state that shows the best practices. "That means we want to commit ourselves to a pact for competitiveness." "What we want to establish is a pact for competitiveness and in so doing we want to make it very clear that we intend to grow together more closely at a political level, which is not to say that there should not be a competition for the best solution among the member states." "Our deadline would be to aim for the March European Council meeting to take the definitive proposals, which is to say that before that council meeting we would have to agree amongst the euro area members and the Eurogroup members on the details of that pact. "...Before the end of the year we will be able to in very concrete terms furnish proof that we are serious about such a pact." "We want to send out a clear message, that as the European Union, we intend to grow together. What we want to establish is a pact for competitiveness. Before the end of the year, we will show proof that we are serious about the pact."
