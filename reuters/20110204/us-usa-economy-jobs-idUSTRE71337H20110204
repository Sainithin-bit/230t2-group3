 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The job market looks quite different depending on which of the two Labor Department surveys you read. 

 The headline figure showing a paltry January jobs gain of 36,000 was skewed by winter weather that kept an estimated 886,000 people from working, according to a Labor Department official. But the unemployment rate, which is drawn from a survey of households rather than business establishments, dropped to 9.0 percent from 9.4 percent in December, the lowest level since April 2009 and down nearly a full percentage point in the span of two months. WHAT GIVES? * January employment reports are typically tricky to interpret because the Labor Department makes adjustments to its population counts, which means comparisons to December are not always apples-to-apples when looking at the data from the department's household survey. However, the agency said the labor force count did not change this time. * Smoothed to take into account the change in the population count, the household survey showed the number of people reporting they were employed jumped by 589,000, and the number unemployed fell by 590,000. * That means the decline in the jobless rate was not a matter of discouraged workers dropping out, something that had been a significant factor in previous months, but rather fully a sign of labor-market strength. * The household survey is notoriously volatile, and economists are reluctant to read too much into any given month's data. However, the job gains in this survey match up with strong readings on January manufacturing and services. WHY THE WEAK JOBS TALLY? * It is hard to square the strong household survey readings with the weak data coming from the establishment polls. * Weather was clearly a factor. The establishment survey showed the construction sector lost 32,000 jobs, which a Labor Department official said may have been caused by weather. Courier and messenger jobs -- which can also be weather-sensitive -- fell by 45,000. * Manufacturing added 49,000 jobs, well above expectations, with big gains in durable goods and motor vehicles. That fits with recent data showing strong auto sales. WHERE TO FROM HERE? * Stripping out the weather effect makes the job count look somewhat better, but still nothing close to what the household survey indicates. * There may be some catch-up in February's report. The Labor Department revised up December and November hiring, marking six consecutive months of upward revisions. * Other surveys have shown a pick-up in small-business hiring and hiring intentions, so it could be that the Labor Department is not catching those companies in its survey of establishments. That would help explain the divergence between the household and establishment surveys.
