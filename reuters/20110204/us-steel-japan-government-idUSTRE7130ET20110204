 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japan's chief government spokesman said on Friday he hoped the country's antimonopoly watchdog would make a speedy decision on whether to approve a plan by Nippon Steel Corp ( 5401.T ) and Sumitomo Metal Industries 5405.T to merge. 

 "The (Fair Trade Commission) will make a decision based on the law, but I hope they take speedy action taking into consideration various social and economic factors," Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano told a news conference. Nippon Steel and Sumitomo Metal Industries plan to merge to create the world's second-largest steelmaker. The deal is subject to review by Japan's antimonopoly watchdog, the Fair Trade Commission.
