 (Reuters) - Banks around the world are expected to pay smaller bonuses for 2010 than the previous year after bumping up fixed pay, leaving total compensation similar to 2009. 

 Major U.S. banks have told staff details of their pay, while Europe's top banks are doing so in the next month alongside their 2010 earnings. Tougher regulations are seeing more of the bonuses being paid in shares and more being deferred, affecting junior staff as well as senior bankers. Several banks are dishing out more dreaded "doughnuts," or zero bonus, to free up cash for star performers, according to banking and headhunter industry sources. In London, base salaries for a mid-level vice-president position typically range from 80,000 to 150,000 pounds ($129,000-$241,800). Their total compensation can top $400,000. Managing directors typically get 210,000 to 300,000 pounds ($338,500-$483,600) in base salary, although more senior bankers can get up to 500,000 pounds. Total compensation can at least double the base salary. Following are details from banking and headhunting industry sources on how much banks are paying and how they are structuring pay for 2010: BANK OF AMERICA/MERRILL LYNCH: Bonuses said to have been quite arbitrary, with the majority in investment banking down 10-20 percent on the year. BARCLAYS CAPITAL: Not yet announced, is considering an innovative structure that could pay senior staff in part with a contingent convertible-type instrument. CITIGROUP: Base salaries raised for managing directors and investment banking bonuses seen up about a quarter on 2009, when payouts were low compared with rivals. Bonuses in equities said to be near flat, mixed in FICC. CREDIT SUISSE: Upfront cash awards more restricted, with senior bankers said to be getting 30 percent cash and 70 percent deferred over four years. The Swiss bank says every bonus above 50,000 francs ($52,750) is subject to deferral, which at managing director level is half in shares. DEUTSCHE BANK: Average pay for investment bankers was 373,000 euros for 2010, up 5 percent. Bonus award down for 2010, offset by higher fixed salary and more deferred. For senior bankers the cash element of the bonus is said to be as low as 20 percent, deferred over three years. GOLDMAN SACHS: Total pay averaged $431,000 last year. Some bonuses said to be 80 percent in cash -- a higher proportion than most firms -- deferred over three years. Wide range of bonus awards, ranging from down a quarter to 20 percent higher in investment banking, equities and FICC. HSBC: Delayed bonus news until after results on February 28, later than last year. Bonuses expected to be lower, but more modest decrease for staff in Asia. JP MORGAN: Average pay for investment bankers was $380,000 as total compensation rose 4 percent, but the bonus pot was smaller than last year. Investment banking managing directors said to get 35-60 percent of bonus in deferred shares over three years. In equities and FICC, bonuses ranged from 20 percent down to slightly up. MORGAN STANLEY: Bank said it would defer 60 percent of all bonuses, with half expected to be in shares, and 80 percent for senior bankers. NOMURA: Financial year ends in March. Expected to pay in line with rivals after higher payouts in recent years. ROYAL BANK OF SCOTLAND: The part-nationalized bank has been told it should be a "back marker" on pay. UBS: Investment banking bonuses expected to be slightly down after third-quarter loss. Will be based on new rating system. Bank has delayed announcement until February 16.
