 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japan's Nippon Steel Corp ( 5401.T ) and Sumitomo Metal Industries 5405.T said they would merge next year to create the world's second-largest steelmaker after ArcelorMittal ( ISPA.AS ), aiming to cut costs and accelerate expansion overseas. 

 Here are the views of some analysts on the deal: FUJIO ANDO, SENIOR MANAGING DIRECTOR, CHIBAGIN ASSET MANAGEMENT, TOKYO "This is a positive move. Both companies have many strength in technologies in producing high-quality steel products. By merging operations, they could raise global competitiveness. "Japanese companies cannot compete against others including China and India in terms of volume, but Japan can still lead against others in producing high-quality steel products. "But there are many unanswered questions, such as what would happen to a partnership between Nippon Steel and Kobe Steel as they hold each other's shares. We also want to see whether this will affect their fair trade issue. We may potentially see many consolidations, such as shutting down one of their key steel mills." JEREMIE CAPRON, CLSA ANALYST, TOKYO "The new group has a chance to become very competitive in Asia. The merged company will have the best product line-up in the industry ranging from construction steel, auto steel sheets, thick plates to seamless pipes. That's quite unique, and the No.1 company, ArcelorMittal, does not have such a product line-up." He added that there was room for Sumitomo Metal to cut costs with the help of Nippon Steel. JOHN MEYER, ANALYST, INVESTMENT BANK FAIRFAX IN LONDON "These are two industry goliaths. The merger of these two titans of industry looks designed to exceed anything the Chinese can do. The integration of Nippon steel and Sumitomo Metal Industries combines the production and technical skills of both companies to produce better quality products more efficiently and more effectively. Other steel producers will struggle to compete with the new efficiencies of scale and services being offered by the joining of these titans." SEBASTIAN LEWIS, HEAD OF RESEARCH AND CONSULTING, STEEL BUSINESS BRIEFING "We see this proposed merger not as a move toward global domination, but rather a defensive measure by the Japanese to maintain their technological lead and keep pace with other major steelmakers in East Asia such as POSCO, who have ambitious plans for expansion, particularly in emerging economies."
