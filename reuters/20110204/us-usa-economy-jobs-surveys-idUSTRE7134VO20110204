 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The U.S. unemployment rate recorded its biggest two-month decline since 1958 in January, yet the government's tally of last month's job growth came in far short of Wall Street's expectations. 

 The Labor Department's headline figure showed a paltry 36,000 jobs created in January, well short of analysts' expectations for 145,000. So why did the jobless rate drop to 9 percent last month, its lowest level since April 2009? Below are some questions and answers on why the unemployment rate and jobs count can send such seemingly differing signals and how economists called it so wrong. WHY DID THE JOBLESS RATE FALL SO FAR WHEN JOB GROWTH WAS MODEST? The employment report is compiled from two different surveys. Economists tend to look at the bigger and less-volatile survey of non-farm employers. That's the survey that yielded the 36,000 increase in employment. The jobless rate is derived from a separate survey of households. For its establishment survey, the Labor Department polls about 140,000 businesses and government agencies. In contrast, it polls only about 60,000 households for its household survey -- one reason economists rely more heavily on the poll of employers. The household survey showed the number of people employed rose by 589,000 after adjusting for different population counts between the two months. The number of unemployed dropped by almost exactly the same count. That explains the drop in the jobless rate. Interpreting the household series was particularly tricky for January because the government updates its population counts to incorporate fresher data, and that means comparisons between December and January are skewed. Some economists initially thought the drop in the jobless rate reflected an exodus of workers from the labor force. However, a special data series smoothing out differences related to the new population count showed that the size of the labor force held steady. WHY WERE ECONOMISTS SO FAR OFF IN THEIR FORECASTS? Weather was a big wild card this month. Heavy snowstorms kept 886,000 people from work last month, a Labor Department official said. That was roughly double the number who are snow-bound in a typical January. Economists find it very hard to estimate how much heavy storms might impact the payroll count; indeed, even afterward it is impossible to quantify the effect fully. Part of the reason is the way the Labor Department conducts its survey of employers. If you were paid at all, even for just one hour, during the survey reference pay period -- the pay period containing the 12th of the month -- you are considered employed for purposes of the report. The government may also be undercounting jobs coming from newly created businesses, Labor Secretary Hilda Solis said. The agency has to find businesses in order to poll them, and it takes time to discover newly opened companies. That may help explain why the household survey shows so many more people finding work. The Labor Department has revised up its job tally for six consecutive months through December, and may do so again when it releases February jobs data next month. WHY ARE ADP AND OTHER SURVEYS TELLING A DIFFERENT STORY? It could be exactly what Solis is talking about. ADP, which releases a private-sector job growth figure two days before the government data, has been much maligned for missing the mark. But for most of 2010, ADP was missing on the low end -- it was reporting smaller job gains than the Labor Department was until December, when its estimate was far higher. That was once again the case in January 2011. In both instances, the ADP data showed small- and medium-sized businesses accounting for the overwhelming majority of job growth. Other surveys have also pointed to healthier labor market trends. The Institute for Supply Management's monthly polls of both manufacturing and services companies showed stronger hiring in January. The two ISMs, plus ADP, lend credence to Solis' argument that the Labor Department is missing some small-business hiring. WHY ARE THERE OFTEN BIG REVISIONS TO PRIOR MONTHS? The government's survey of employers is large, but even government statisticians agree they can't capture all of the ongoing shifts in a 153-million strong labor force. Data for the prior two months are subject to revision with each new month of data. These revisions incorporate additional responses from the employers that had been surveyed. The department then has to extrapolate from its findings how many jobs were actually created or lost. It also has to rely on a statistical model to estimate how many new businesses were created or how many old ones died in any given month. Since the job count is simply based on a statistical sample, it is only a best guess at reality. The Labor Department says the margin of error in its payroll poll is around 100,000. That is, there is a 90 percent chance the true change in employment stood between -64,000 and +136,000 in January. (Reporting by  Lucia Mutikani  and  Emily Kaiser ; Editing by Dan Grebler)
