 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Meat exports and higher pork prices helped Tyson Foods Inc post a much larger quarterly profit that surprised Wall Street and sent shares to an eight-month high. 

 Pork profits nearly tripled from a year earlier, helped by exports, to lead gains, while chicken profits more than doubled. "Pork was unreal. They are generating unheard of margins in pork. Pork is what really drove it," said Heather Jones, agribusiness analyst with BB&T Capital Markets, who said share prices of $20 to $21 were possible. Tyson sold pork at 23.5-percent higher prices in the quarter, beef prices were up 16.4 percent, and the volume of chicken sales was up 8.4 percent, although at slightly lower prices. "This tone is incredible," Tim Ramey, analyst with D.A. Davidson, said of the beef and pork price increases. "2011 looks like it is going to be a great year for Tyson." Profits in beef, its largest unit were down slightly and prepared foods was also down. During a conference call, Tyson officials told analysts it continues to see strong beef, pork and chicken exports, with South Korea recently buying pork. While total U.S. meat production will be up slightly this year, they said exports will mean slightly less domestic supplies. "I don't see anything on the horizon that is going to, at this point, diminish any of the export demand," said Jim Lochner, Tyson's chief operating officer. Production problems overseas, such as foot-and-mouth disease in South Korea and floods in Australia, have turned foreign buyers to the United States. HIGH GRAIN PRICES TO NARROW CHICKEN PROFITS High grain prices were a concern of analysts on the call, who worried feed costs may hurt chicken profits. Tyson officials said high feed prices will likely mean smaller profits for chicken for the remainder of fiscal 2011, which runs through September. At the Chicago Board of Trade feed corn futures prices are up 65 percent from last year at over $6.50 per bushel. Tyson buys cattle and hogs for its beef and pork operations and raises its chickens. The company assured analysts that despite 1 to 2 percent fewer cattle this year there will be enough for its plants. High feed costs and slow meat sales during the recession had cattle producers reducing herds and analysts predict fewer numbers and higher cattle prices in 2011. [nN0337575]. (Graphic:  r.reuters.com/sad87r  ) Earnings for the quarter ended January 1 at the world largest meat company were $298 million, or 78 cents per share, compared with $160 million, or 42 cents, a year earlier. Minus a 3-cent-a-share gain for an investment sale earnings were 75 cents. On that basis Wall Street analysts, on average, expected 62 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue for the quarter was $7.61 billion, while Wall Street expected $7.15 billion. Shares were up 6.78 percent at $18.75 at the New York Stock Exchange, the highest since May.
