 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - PulteGroup Inc ( PHM.N ) said its homebuilding business is operating at about break-even level, bringing its quarterly results more in line with rivals. 

 "The good news is that the U.S. economy is providing clearer signs of recovery," Chief Executive Officer Richard Dugas told analysts on a conference call on Friday. "Having people who are employed growing more confident is critical to getting them back into our models." Dugas said signs of life in the economy, such as a slight uptick in consumer confidence, are reasons to believe the industry might be stabilizing, albeit at low levels. On Friday, a government report showed that U.S. employment barely rose in January, though the unemployment rate dropped. Compared with a loss of $917.2 million last year, No. 2 Pulte's loss before income taxes shrank to $190.5 million.

Sales of previously used homes rose 12 percent in December, for example. Buyers are seeing better value in existing homes compared with new homes, wrote Credit Suisse analyst Dan Oppenheim in a research note. But Dugas said some want new homes, and will buy them if they feel economically secure. "We believe the housing struggle is more about demand than supply," he said. RELIEF RALLY Investors were probably pleasantly surprised that Pulte's results were not worse, said Morningstar analyst Mike Gaiden, pointing out that Pulte's shares fell sharply after it reported a wider loss in the third quarter. On Thursday, the company's shares were down around 5 percent in advance of its quarterly numbers. The company posted a net loss of $165.4 million, or 44 cents a share, compared with a loss of $116.9 million, or 31 cents per share, a year earlier. The loss includes $196 million in charges related to land writedowns, debt and restructuring, and $35 million in tax benefits. "These results are more in line with their peers," Gaiden said. "The stock could benefit from a bit of a relief rally." Orders in the quarter fell 19 percent to 3,044 homes, in line with the 16.7 percent decrease reported by bigger rival D.R. Horton Inc ( DHI.N ) late last month. Revenue slumped 31.5 percent to $1.19 billion, compared with the average analyst estimates of $1.12 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue from homebuilding fell 31 percent to $1.16 billion. "Operating results remained weak, but generally in line with trends experienced by peers," wrote Barclays Capital credit analyst Vincent Foley in a note to clients. Pulte shares were up 5 cents or 0.7 percent at $7.59 at midday on Friday, off an earlier high at $7.83 on the New York Stock Exchange.
