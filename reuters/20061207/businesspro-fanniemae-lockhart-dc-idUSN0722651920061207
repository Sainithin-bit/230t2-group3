 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Mortgage finance giant Fannie Mae's 
FNM.N top regulator said Thursday that it plans to file a 
suit by year-end against former company executives in 
connection with a massive accounting scandal. 

  The Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight had 
previously said it was preparing to sue former Fannie chief 
executive Franklin Raines and other top officials.  An OFHEO spokeswoman said on Thursday that the regulator 
would act by the end of the year. James Lockhart, the OFHEO 
chief, has said the executives should return compensation that 
was tied to hitting earnings targets.  OFHEO said in a special examination, which was finished in 
May, that Raines and other executives like Timothy Howard, the 
former chief financial officer, wrongly massaged earnings for 
years in order to trigger bonuses,  According to the OFHEO report, of Raines' $90 million 
compensation between 1998 and 2003, over $52 million was tied 
to earnings per share targets.  The report said that of Howard's $30 million compensation 
in those years, over $16.5 million was tied to those targets.  The regulator also said chief business officer Robert 
Levin, current CEO Daniel Mudd, and former vice-chair Jamie 
Gorelick had pay tied to flawed earnings and accounting.
