  (Adds comment from Macklowe rep) 

 NEW YORK  Dec 7 (Reuters) - Financier Carl Icahn and real
estate developer Harry Macklowe have made separate offers for
parts of Reckson Associates Realty Corp.'s RA.N portfolio of
properties, people familiar with the offers said on Thursday.  The last-minute bids came as SL Green Realty Corp. ( SLG.N )said it expects close to or more than two-thirds of voting
Reckson shareholders to approve the almost $4 billion merger of
the two real estate companies.  A spokesman for Macklowe confirmed the developer's recent
interest in some of Reckson's properties, but said he is no
longer interested. An Icahn representative declined to
comment.  "They had considered making bids for certain Reckson New
York City assets but in light of today's developments, they
have decided not to bid," a spokesman for Macklowe said.  SL Green and Reckson each said they had not received any
offer from Macklowe, but made no official comment about an
Icahn bid.  A source said Macklowe offered $2.3 billion for Reckson's
Manhattan and Long Island City properties, less than the value
SL Green has put on those properties. Icahn also sent a letter
offering to buy some of Reckson's suburban properties,
according two different sources familiar with the offer.  It was not immediately clear whether the letters went to SL
Green or Reckson.  Reckson Chief Executive Scott Rechler said the company
would not consider either offer. SL Green said it will not
agree to any further extension or adjournment of the
shareholder vote.  On Wednesday, Icahn ended his bid for Reckson, saying he
ran out of time after his partners -- Macklowe and Mack-Cali
Realty Corp. ( CLI.N ), a real estate investment trust -- dropped
out.
