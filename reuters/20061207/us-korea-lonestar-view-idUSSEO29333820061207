 SEOUL  (Reuters) - South Korea has found illegal aspects in the 2003 sale of Korea Exchange Bank (KEB) to U.S. fund Lone Star, a senior prosecutor said on Thursday, which may eventually lead the courts to declare the deal void. 

 KEY POINTS: The Supreme Prosecutors' Office indicts former finance ministry official Byeon Yangho and former KEB CEO Lee Kang-won on bribery charges linked to the 2003 deal. Prosecutor says to continue probe of 2003 Lone Star-KEB deal. Financial Supervisory Commission watchdog says plans no immediate action after the prosecutors' finding.

Lone Star's position is still valid. "I don't think there is anything so far that supports financial authorities nullifying the 2003 deal. Based on what's announced, Lone Star itself could be considered a victim of the authorization given for the deal." - - - - HENRY MORRIS, DIRECTOR, INDUSTRIAL RESEARCH AND CONSULTING "This is all predicated on Lone Star being convicted. These are allegations only. "If they are saying that the original deal was fraudulent because officials were bribed, then what we are talking about is the government taking over control of KEB from Lone Star. In that case, what they would do, I suppose is return Lone Star's original investment. Of course they might levy some fines. "I don't think it (the decision) was a surprise because we have been expecting at the end of this very long investigation of over nine months that some criminal allegations would be levied." - - - - CHANG H LEE, BANKING ANALYST, DAIWA SECURITIES IN SEOUL "The decision will not have a positive effect on foreign investors' sentiment but it will make major deals more transparent and clear. So future M&A deals such as the Industrial Bank or KEB will be more transparent. "Whether the decision will have a positive or a negative impact on the value of KEB depends on what the final saying will be by the court. "Like many newspapers have reported already, Lone Star has the option to counter attack, maybe by filing a suit with an international court." - - - - RYU JAE-CHEOL, ANALYST, TONGYANG INVESTMENT BANK "It was just the result from the prosecutors' investigation. There will be more disputes between Lone Star and prosecutors for the next several months. We will need to wait and see the final decision of courts. "But the result that S.Korea prosecutors found illegal aspects in Lone Star's purchase of KEB will badly impact on foreign investors in the country." - - - - (Reporting by  Jack Kim ; Jon Herskovitz, Kim Yeonhee, Marie France Han and Kang Shinhye)
