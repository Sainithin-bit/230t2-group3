 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Primedia Inc. PRM.N said on Thursday it is selling hunting and fishing titles such as Guns & Ammo and Fly Fisherman to private-equity firm InterMedia Partners LP for $170 million in cash. 

 The 17 magazines include other titles such as Game & Fish, Florida Sportsman and In-Fisherman. The sale includes events, Web sites, television and radio programming related to the titles, the company said. The group will be named InterMedia Outdoors The transaction is expected to close by the end of the 2007 first quarter. Primedia expects the sale to add to earnings in the quarters ahead, Chief Executive Dean Nelson said in a statement. "This is a committed enthusiast group with enormous buying power and advertiser appeal, which has historically been under-served and under-valued by mainstream media," said Leo Hindery Jr., co-managing partner of InterMedia, in a statement. Hindery is a one-time titan in the cable industry, formerly serving as president of John Malone's Tele-Communications Inc., or TCI.
