 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Hewlett-Packard Co. ( HPQ.N ) said 
on Thursday it would pay California $14.5 million to settle a 
civil case related to board-leak investigations that led to the 
resignation of Chairman Patricia Dunn. 

  HP said that under the agreement, filed in Santa Clara 
County Superior Court, it would also put measures in place to 
ensure its internal investigations comply with state law.  During the company's internal probes, investigators 
impersonated HP board members, employees and journalists to get 
their private telephone records.  California Attorney General Bill Lockyer filed criminal 
charges against Dunn, who resigned on September 22, and four 
others in October because of tactics used in HP's efforts in 
2005 and 2006 to find the source of media leaks.  "The Hewlett-Packard incident has helped shine a national 
spotlight on a major privacy protection problem," Lockyer said. 
"Fortunately, Hewlett-Packard is not Enron. I commend the firm 
for cooperating instead of stonewalling, for taking instead of 
shirking responsibility."  HP said that $13.5 million of the total amount would be 
used to create a Privacy and Piracy Fund to help California 
prosecutors in investigating consumer privacy and piracy 
violations.  Another $650,000 would be used to pay statutory damages and 
$350,000 would reimburse the Attorney General's office for its 
investigation.  HP also said there was no finding of liability against it 
as part of the settlement. The California attorney general will 
not pursue civil claims against the company or against its 
current and former directors, officers and employees, HP said.
