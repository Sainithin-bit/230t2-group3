 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Recreational vehicle maker Fleetwood Enterprises Inc. FLE.N on Thursday said its quarterly loss had widened tenfold after restructuring charges, including severance payments, and costs from discontinued operations. 

 The company posted a net loss of $19.8 million, or 31 cents per share, from continuing operations in the second quarter ended on October 29, compared with year-earlier net income of $3.8 million, or 7 cents per share. Analysts polled by Reuters Estimates had expected a loss of 32 cents per share. Including discontinued operations, the net loss widened to $20.4 million, or 32 cents per share, from $1.9 million, or 3 cents per share. In early November, Fleetwood released preliminary sales numbers for the quarter that showed revenue dropped 16 percent to $528 million as demand for recreational vehicles and manufactured housing fell. Looking ahead, the company said weaker conditions in the winter months, a seasonally slow period for the company, would be exacerbated by tough competition. "We expect operating results in the third quarter to be weaker than in the just completed quarter," Chief Executive Elden Smith said in a news release. Analysts expect the company to report a loss of 21 cents per share in its third quarter.
