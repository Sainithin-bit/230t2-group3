 (Reuters) - Britain's Rank Group ( RNK.L ) said on Thursday it had agreed to sell its Hard Rock cafe and casino business to the Seminole Tribe of Florida for $965 million. 

 Here are some key facts about the business activities of the tribe: * The tribe is descended from the few hundred Seminole Indians who did not leave Florida when the U.S. government attempted to relocate them to a reservation in Oklahoma in the late 1800s * Consisting of about 3,300 members, the tribe's business operations include gaming, cattle ranching, citrus production, tourism promotion, sports management and tobacco sales. More than 90 percent of its budget comes from gaming revenue. * The Florida Seminoles' first stable business enterprise was started in 1977 when they started selling discount and tax-free tobacco products. The tribe opened its first high-stakes bingo hall and casino in the United States in 1979. * It currently owns and operates two Seminole Hard Rock Hotels & Casinos and five non-Hard Rock casinos in Florida. * Seminole ranchers are among the top ten cattle producers in Florida and the tribe also raises rodeo stock and operates the Big Cypress Rodeo Grounds.
