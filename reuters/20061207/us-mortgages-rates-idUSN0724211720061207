 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Average interest rates for U.S. mortgages dropped for the fourth week in a row, to levels not seen since the beginning of the year, according to a survey released by finance company Freddie Mac FRE.N on Thursday. 

 Rates for 30-year mortgage rates fell to 6.11 percent from 6.14 percent, the lowest since 6.10 percent in the January 19 week. Rates on 15-year mortgages also ebbed to 5.84 percent from 5.87 percent. The last time they were lower was in the second week of February, when they averaged 5.83 percent. One-year adjustable rate mortgages were 5.43 percent, down from 5.46 percent. A year ago, 30-year mortgages averaged 6.32 percent, 15-year mortgages 5.87 percent, and the one-year ARM 5.16 percent. "Continued signs of slowing in the housing market and weakness in the manufacturing sector helped keep mortgage rates down this week," said Frank Nothaft, Freddie Mac vice president and chief economist, in a statement. "Looking forward in the housing market, we think that housing is about 2/3 of the way through the correction, and should stabilize by mid-year 2007," he also said. Freddie Mac said lenders charged an average of 0.5 percent in fees and points on 30- and 15-year mortgages, both up from 0.4 percent last week. They charged 0.7 percent on the one-year arm, the same as last week. The "5/1" ARM, set at a fixed rate for five years and adjustable each following year, fell to an average of 5.92 percent from 5.95 percent. Fees and points on the hybrid mortgage were unchanged at 0.5 percent. Freddie Mac is a mortgage finance company chartered by Congress that buys mortgages from lenders and packages them into securities to sell to investors or to hold in its own portfolio.
