 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Whirlpool Corp. ( WHR.N ) said on 
Thursday that it has reached a definitive agreement to sell the 
Hoover floor-care business to Techtronic Industries Co. 
Ltd.( 0669.HK ) for $107 million in cash as it narrows its focus 
on appliances. 

  Whirlpool said it expects to close the deal in the first 
quarter of 2007 after regulatory clearance. Whirlpool will 
retain the liabilities associated with pension and 
post-retirement benefit plans for currently retired Hoover 
employees.  Whirlpool also said that it is working toward selling the 
Jade business by the end of this year.
