 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Eli Lilly and Co. ( LLY.N ) on Thursday forecast profit gains next year below its expected 2006 growth and offered few big surprises at a meeting to describe its experimental drugs, sending shares lower. 

 The company said it aims to seek approval by the end of next year for the most important of its new products, blood clot medicine prasugrel, a timeline that Merrill Lynch analyst David Risinger said represented a three-month delay. Lilly had previously said it would seek approval for prasugrel in the second half of 2007. Lilly, whose shares fell 1.6 percent, provided the forecasts at a meeting here with Wall Street analysts and investors to describe its strategy and drugs being tested. Lilly, maker of schizophrenia treatment Zyprexa and anti-impotence drug Cialis, said it was counting on steady introduction of new medicines to keep earnings growing. "Our goal is to launch at least one new product per year, on average, through the remainder of this decade, and to position ourselves to launch two per year early in the next decade," the company said. The company described an array of experimental products, but a high percentage were in early or mid-stage testing and not likely to reach the marketplace soon. "The real question that looms is post-2011," said Morgan Stanley analyst Jami Rubin, referring to the year that Zyprexa's U.S. patent lapses, when Lilly's top-selling product will become prey to cheaper generics. Lilly continues to expect a 2006 profit of between $3.10 to $3.20 per share, excluding special items, reflecting growth of 8 to 12 percent It projected 2007 earnings of $3.25 to $3.35 per share, including the estimated 10 cent per share dilutive impact of Lilly's planned $2.1 billion acquisition of biotechnology company ICOS Corp ICOS.O, with which it now co-markets Cialis. Analysts polled by Reuters Estimates, on average, expected $3.40 per share, but the forecast did not include the 10-cent per share negative impact of the ICOS deal. Lilly spokesman Phil Belt said Lilly's 2007 forecast was therefore within the range of Wall Street expectations. Prudential Equity analyst Tim Anderson said the 2007 forecast was well below his own projections, in part because of escalating costs. "Whereas various other drug companies are demonstrably reducing their cost structure, Lilly is guiding for operating expenses to grow by low double digits," Anderson said. Asked if Lilly would need to acquire products or companies to make up for Zyprexa's coming sales decline, Chief Executive Sidney Taurel told Reuters after the meeting, "A lot will depend on how successful some of our new products are." "Prasugrel alone could be enough," Taurel said, but he speculated the company would go ahead with acquisitions to "hedge our bets." Lilly said it could seek approval for three other especially promising products by 2010 -- enzastaurin for brain cancer and lymphoma, an inhaled form of insulin, and arzoxifene for osteoporosis. The company also aims to win approval for altered forms of Zyprexa and its widely used diabetes drug Byetta, and new uses for its other medicines. It also described drugs in earlier research for cancer, schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, diabetes, heart disease and arthritis. From 2008 to 2010, Lilly said it expects earnings-per share growth in the "high single to low double digits" percentage range. Reuters Estimates had projected escalating double digit growth in 2008, 2009 and 2010. Lilly said that company revenue in 2006 would grow about 7 percent, but would expand in the high-single or low-double-digit range next year. The company said that accelerating sales growth next year would be fueled by new drugs and by Lilly's ownership of Cialis once the drugmaker completes its planned purchase of ICOS. Shares of Lilly closed down 87 cents at $53.99 on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday.
