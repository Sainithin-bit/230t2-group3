 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The economy will likely pick up in 2007 after output growth slows rapidly in late 2006, according to a survey conducted by the Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank released on Thursday. 

 Economic growth for 2008, released for the first time in the survey, was forecast at 3.0 percent. Economists lowered their forecasts for U.S. growth in the first half of 2007 to 2.8 percent from 3.0 percent when the previous survey was taken six months ago. They forecast growth at 3.1 percent for the second half of 2007. Forecasts for the second half of this year were sharply lower at 2.1 percent from 2.9 percent. "These forecasts are lower than in the previous survey, particularly for the second half of 2006, suggesting output growth might not be as strong in the very short run," the survey said. Headline consumer price inflation was seen easing to an average 2.1 percent next year from 3.3 percent in 2006. The Livingston Survey of 40 financial market, academic and corporate economists is conducted twice a year.
