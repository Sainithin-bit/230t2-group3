 SEOUL  (Reuters) - South Korea has found illegal aspects in the 2003 sale of Korea Exchange Bank (KEB) to U.S. fund Lone Star, a senior prosecutor said on Thursday, which may eventually lead the courts to declare the deal void. 

 "Through this investigation, we confirmed that the sale of Korea Exchange Bank was conducted abnormally without following regulations and due procedure, and the sale price did not reach the adequate level," the Supreme Prosecutors' Office said in a statement. Prosecutors also said they had indicted two former top executives of KEB, a former director general of the finance ministry and the CEO of Hyundai Marine and Fire Insurance Co. Ltd. ( 001450.KS ) on bribery charges linked to the 2003 sale of  KEB. "(Former finance ministry official) Byeon Yangho and (former KEB CEO) Lee Kang-won conspired to exaggerate financial difficulty at KEB, which did not need to be sold, artificially to enable Lone Star to buy it cheaply," the statement said. The findings may hamper Lone Star's efforts to sell its 64.62 percent stake in KEB after it terminated a $7.3 billion sale of the bank to Kookmin Bank 060000.KS in late November because of the legal battle. A Lone Star spokeswoman in Seoul declined to comment immediately. A spokesman for KEB also declined to comment. A senior Financial Supervisory Commission official said the regulator planned no immediate action following the prosecutors' announcement. If Lone Star is found guilty of the alleged improprieties related to its 2003 KEB purchase, the deal could be ruled void by the courts. The Supreme Court could also force Lone Star to dispose of shares that exceed a 10 percent stake in KEB. Shares in KEB were unchanged at 13,500 won by 0113 GMT, against the wider market's  .KS11  0.09 percent rise. The investigations, initiated at the request of politicians in February, has raised an outcry among foreign investors, who feared a growing backlash against heavy profits foreign investment funds had reaped by buying distressed Korean assets. The nine-month legal battle led Lone Star, the most active private equity fund in Asia's third-largest economy, to scrap a $7.3 billion deal in late November to sell the country's fifth-largest bank to top-ranked Kookmin Bank 060000.KS. The Supreme Prosecutors' Office has been looking into allegations that data on Korea Exchange Bank's 004940.KS financial health was understated to help Lone Star LS.UL buy the bank at a bargain price of $1.2 billion.
