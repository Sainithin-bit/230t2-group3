 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Wireless chip company Broadcom 
Corp. ( BRCM.O ) expects to finish its fourth quarter with its 
inventories near an ideal level, Chief Executive Scott McGregor 
said on Thursday. 

  "We still believe we're on track for Q4, to close out Q4 
with inventories approximating an ideal level for us. So we're 
very comfortable with that," McGregor told an investment 
conference.  Many microchip companies have faced inventory issues this 
year after many customers ordered too much product, then cut 
back on purchasing.  McGregor said Broadcom saw the inventory glut emerging in 
the second quarter and began adjusting its internal inventories 
downward in response.  The shares of Broadcom, which competes against companies 
such as Texas Instruments Inc. TXN.N and Qualcomm Inc. 
( QCOM.O ), fell 2.5 percent to close at $33.62 on the Nasdaq.
