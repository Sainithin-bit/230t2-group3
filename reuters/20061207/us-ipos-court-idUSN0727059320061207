 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court said on Thursday it would hear an appeal by leading Wall Street underwriters and institutional investors of a ruling that a lawsuit accusing them of illegally manipulating the price of stocks in initial public offerings can proceed. 

 The group of companies said a U.S. appeals court in New York used the wrong standard on implied antitrust immunity when it reinstated the lawsuit by the purchasers of stock issued by Internet and technology companies in the late 1990s. The lawsuit accused the firms of conspiring to impose anti-competitive charges on prospective buyers in some 900 initial public offerings and to inflate the price of the securities in the so-called aftermarket. A federal judge dismissed the class action lawsuit on the grounds that federal securities laws preempt federal and state antitrust laws. The judge said the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has the power to regulate the conduct alleged in the suit. But the appeals court disagreed and said: "The heart of the alleged anti-competitive behavior finds no shelter in the securities law." It ruled there was no evidence that Congress intended to repeal the antitrust laws and immunize "tie-in" agreements on IPOs. Among the firms appealing to the high court were units of Bear Stearns Cos. Inc. BSC.N; Citigroup ( C.N ); Credit Suisse Group ( CSGN.VX ); Fidelity Investments; Goldman Sachs Group Inc. ( GS.N ); Janus Capital Group Inc. ( JNS.N ); J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. ( JPM.N ); Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. LEH.N; Merrill Lynch & Co. Inc. MER.N; and Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ). The companies said in their appeal that the Supreme Court should resolve the issue. They cited the split by U.S. government agencies in the case in the lower courts, with the SEC supporting antitrust immunity for the firms and the Justice Department opposing it. The Supreme Court then asked the Bush administration for its views of the appeal. The Justice Department responded by urging the Supreme Court to hear the appeal by the companies and to provide guidance to the lower courts on how to reconcile the federal antitrust and securities laws. Although the companies are not entitled to the sweeping immunity they advocate, Solicitor General Paul Clement of the Justice Department said the appeals court ruling "could chill legitimate activity in our nation's vitally important financial markets." Clement's brief was also signed by a top SEC lawyer. The high court is expected to hear arguments in the case in March, with a ruling due by the end of June. The court will hear the case with eight of its nine members. Chief Justice John Roberts did not consider the appeal, but the court's order that it would hear the case gave no explanation why Roberts removed himself. In a separate decision earlier this week, a federal appeals court in New York ruled that 12 securities firms will not have to face a class action lawsuit involving six cases that accused them of manipulating the pricing of IPOs for technology companies in the late 1990s.
