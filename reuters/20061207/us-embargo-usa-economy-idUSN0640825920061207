 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - The U.S. economy will expand at a weak pace next year, setting the stage for lower interest rates, according to a UCLA Anderson Forecast report released on Thursday. 

 The forecasting unit's latest report projected quarterly real gross domestic product growth no higher than 2.7 percent next year, reflecting the weak housing market. The weakness also is reflected in a forecast of nonfarm job growth slowing to a rate of 0.3 percent in the second quarter of next year from 1.5 percent currently, and unemployment rising to a high of 5.2 percent in the 2007 fourth quarter from 4.6 percent in the current quarter. As a result, the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates to stimulate business, said Edward Leamer, director of the UCLA Anderson Forecast. "We think the Fed will shift from an inflation concern to a sluggishness concern so that we'll get some rate cuts," Leamer said, adding that he sees the Federal Funds rate falling to 4.5 percent by the fourth quarter of next year. Rate cuts should help lift the Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  to a range of 1,325 to 1,525 next year, with the index ending 2007 at the high end of the range, according to David Shulman, a senior economist with the UCLA Anderson Forecast. "We anticipate that the Fed will be forward enough looking to see by spring that most of the inflation pressure in the system will have been put behind us and thereby set the stage for a series of modest rate cuts," Shulman wrote. Economic growth should reach more than 3 percent by the first quarter of 2008, though the housing sector will have been "greatly reduced" by then, according to Leamer. Housing starts should trend lower and bottom out at an annual rate of 1.4 million in the second quarter of next year, and as builders seek to sell inventory, new-home prices will fall to a low in the third quarter of 2007 at almost 10 percent current levels, Leamer said. Prices for existing homes will "nudge down a bit," he said, noting the housing market downturn will hurt home builders, construction workers, real estate brokers and bankers -- but will not be so severe as to force a recession. Manufacturing has already shed so many jobs it is in no position to produce the kind of massive layoffs that paired with a housing downturn would trigger recession, Leamer added. "We've trimmed it to the bone," Leamer said, referring to factory work. "It's already lean and mean." Additionally, the economy will avoid recession because credit is abundant and consumers will continue spending at a moderate pace, Leamer said.
