 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Lawnmower maker the Toro Company 
( TTC.N ) said on Thursday quarterly earnings slipped in line 
with falling revenue, but beat estimates as growth in its 
professional segment helped offset lower domestic residential 
segment sales. 

  For the quarter ended October 31, Toro said it earned net 
$4.5 million, or 10 cents per share, on net sales of $329.5 
million. That compared with $6.6 million, or 14 cents per 
diluted in the year-ago quarter, on net sales of $337.1 
million.  Analysts had expected 7 cents per share.  The company said it was raising its quarterly dividend to 
12 cents a share from 9 cents per share and said it expects to 
report a 10 to 12 percent increase in per-share earnings for 
2007.  For its fiscal first quarter, which it said was typically a 
small revenue period, it expects to report earnings of 30 to 33 
cents per share.
