 LONDON  (Reuters) - Shares on Wall Street looked set for a flat to slightly higher start on Thursday with key economic data ahead constraining trade. 

 By 1000 GMT, U.S. stock futures SPc1 DJc1 NDc1 were between 0.02 percent and 0.1 percent higher. "U.S. indices have been strong this week but remain a little range bound ahead of tomorrow's non-farm payroll," financial bookmaker Finspreads said in a note. Investors are looking at the U.S. November non-farm payrolls as a key pointer to the strength of the U.S. economy and the likely direction of U.S. interest rates. A Reuters poll forecast the data to show 110,000 jobs created compared with 92,000 in October. Finspreads said it was expecting something between 90,000 and 100,000 jobs. On the corporate front, media reports said News Corp. NWSa.N NWS.N and its second-biggest shareholder, Liberty Media Corp. LCAPA.O are close to a deal that will solidify News Corp. Chairman Rupert Murdoch's control of his company. Nuance Communications Inc. ( NUAN.O ), which makes voice-recognition software, will buy rival MobileVoiceControl, acquiring technology to surf the Web on wireless devices using speech controls. Burns Philp & Co said it had agreed to sell its Bluebird foods snacks business to PepsiCo NZ ( PEP.N ) for NZ$245 million ($168 million). On Wednesday, the Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  fell 6.52 points, or 0.27 percent, to close at 2,445.86. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  dropped 22.35 points, or 0.18 percent, to end at 12,309.25. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  finished off 1.86 points, or 0.13 percent, at 1,412.90.
