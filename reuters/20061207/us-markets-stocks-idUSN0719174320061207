 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. stocks fell on Thursday as investors locked in profits ahead of jobs data on Friday that could show further weakening in the economy and hurt corporate earnings. 

 The Nasdaq took the biggest hit among major indexes as shares of Apple Computer Inc. ( AAPL.O ) fell 3.1 percent, or $2.79, to $87.04. Apple's stock has risen 80 percent since July. At the same time, concerns have been raised that holiday sales for its iPod may not be as strong as initially expected. The Dow Jones industrial average earlier rose to within 1 point of an all-time high, but then fell back. Home Depot Inc. ( HD.N ), down 2.5 percent, was among the biggest drags on the Dow after the world's largest home improvement retailer said it found almost 20 years of options grant backdating. Home Depot's shares fell 99 cents to $38.93 on the New York Stock Exchange. "There has been a huge run up in the market and you have the employment number tomorrow and people have profits they are locking in, in the event that the jobs report shows further weakening in the economy," said Eric Kuby, chief investment officer with North Star Investment Management Co. in Chicago. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  dropped 30.84 points, or 0.25 percent, to end at 12,278.41. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  declined 5.61 points, or 0.40 percent, to finish at 1,407.29. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  slid 18.17 points, or 0.74 percent, to close at 2,427.69. RIMM GETS REALITY CHECK Technology stocks fell from the outset, pushing down the Nasdaq. Shares of BlackBerry maker Research In Motion Ltd. RIMM.O slid 4.9 percent after brokerage downgrades of the stock and ranked among the heaviest weights on the Nasdaq 100 .NDX. The stock lost $6.69 to end at $128.75 on the Nasdaq. With Apple, some analysts pointed to unrealistic expectations for iPod sales during the holiday quarter. Caris & Co. analyst Shebly Seyrafi wrote in a note initiating coverage on Apple that "our checks do not support the 'upside potential' believed by the bulls that Apple (will) ship over 20 million iPods in the fourth quarter."

( RYL.N ) fell 3.6 percent, or $2.04, to $54.44 on the NYSE after Credit Suisse cut its rating on the home builder's stock to "underperform" from "neutral."
