 SEATTLE  (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp. ( MSFT.O ) forecast on 
Wednesday that sales of its Zune music player will exceed one 
million units by the end of June 2007 despite a tepid start for 
the device. 

  Earlier this week, a report from market research firm NPD 
Group showed that Zune's share of the U.S. digital music player 
market fell to 2 percent and fifth place in the week ended 
November 25, the second week of sales since its release.  Zune was second with a 9 percent market share in the first 
week after launch.  "While this is expected, our focus is less on week over 
week numbers, and more on the incremental sales that are 
leading to overall growth of the category," said a Microsoft 
spokeswoman in a statement.  Microsoft, which had never announced a forecast for Zune 
sales, said it is now on a path to sell more than one million 
units by June 30, the end of its current fiscal year.  The slow start for the 30-gigabyte Zune underscores the 
huge challenge Microsoft faces in trying to crack into the 
digital music player market, dominated by Apple Computer Inc.'s 
( AAPL.O ) iPod.  Apple has sold more than 70 million iPods since its 
introduction in October 2001 and the iPod commands more than a 
70 percent share of the U.S. market for MP3 players, as they 
are also known.  The Zune, shaped like a pack of playing cards and selling 
for $249, comes with wireless technology that allows users to 
beam photos and songs to one another.  Microsoft has said it plans to invest hundreds of millions 
of dollars to develop and market the Zune, while acknowledging 
that the investment may take years to bear fruit.
