 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - House Democratic lawmakers on Thursday urged the Republican-controlled Congress to punish oil companies that won't renegotiate faulty drilling leases issued by the government almost a decade ago that have allowed companies to avoid paying billions in oil and gas royalties. 

 The lawmakers want to block oil companies from getting drilling leases in new offshore areas unless they reach new terms with the government on the energy exploration contracts signed in 1998 and 1999. "This land is owned by American taxpayers, and these oil companies are getting away with not paying for using it," said Rep. Rahm Emanuel, a Democrat from Illinois. The lawmakers want the renegotiation provision put in legislation the House is scheduled to vote on this week that would open a small area in the Gulf of Mexico near the Alabama-Florida border to oil and gas drilling. The Senate is also set to vote on the offshore drilling plan, which has been included in a larger bill to extend several tax breaks. The Democratic lawmakers' call to punish oil companies comes a day after the Interior Department's inspector general (IG) issued a report that said the MMS does not have an effective compliance program to make sure energy companies pay the fees they owe for drilling on federal leases. The IG said that the MMS's compliance reviews do not adequately evaluate the volumes of drilled oil and gas reported by energy companies, which "increases the risk that MMS may not detect underpaid royalties." Companies generally pay royalties based on 12.5 percent to 16.6 percent of the value of the oil or gas they drill. When royalty underpayments are detected, the MMS does not have procedures to verify that energy companies are actually billed and the fees collected, the IG said. Republican Rep. Darrell Issa, who chaired a House Government Reform subcommittee's hearings into the MMS operations, told Reuters in an interview that the IG's report "basically said MMS doesn't know what they're owed and they don't have an independent ability to find out." He added that "the MMS can't even tell (the inspector general) for sure how many audits they did." Johnnie Burton, who heads the MMS, pledged to act quickly on the IG's findings and will present an "action plan" within 30 days to ensure the agency accurately collects all royalties due to the government.
