 SEOUL  (Reuters) - South Korean mobile phone maker Pantech 
is expected to supply more than 3.5 million handsets to U.S. 
mobile operator Cingular Wireless in 2007, up from 1 million 
estimated for this year, a local media report said on Thursday. 

  The news helped shares in Pantech group's two mobile phone 
making arms, Pantech&Curitel Communications Inc. 063350.KS 
and Pantech Co. Ltd. 025930.KS, jump by midday.  Shares in Pantech&Curitel rose 6.7 percent to 955 won by 
0312 GMT, beating the wider market's 0.36 percent fall. Pantech 
Co. surged 10 percent to trade at 2,310 won.  Pantech was in the final stage of talks to sign the supply 
deal with Cingular, the largest U.S. mobile service carrier, 
online news service Edaily reported, citing Pantech documents 
it obtained.  A spokeswoman for the group declined to comment.  Pantech began shipping phones to Cingular, a venture of 
AT&T Inc. ( T.N ) and BellSouth Corp. BLS.N, this year.  Separately, South Korea's commerce ministry approved on 
Thursday Pantech group's plan to expand a domestic plant.  The expansion, to be completed by late 2008, will more than 
double the production capacity at Pantech's Kimpo plant from 
600,000 units per month currently, Pantech said in a statement.
