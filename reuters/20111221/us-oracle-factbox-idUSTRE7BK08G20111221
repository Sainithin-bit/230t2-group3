 (Reuters) - Oracle Corp missed Wall Street's quarterly earnings forecast for the first time in a decade as the technology giant's corporate customers tightened scrutiny over IT budgets in a worsening economy. 
 It came as a shock for investors because Oracle is considered one of the world's best-managed technology companies when it comes to finances. Here are several key areas where the world's No. 3 software maker fell short: - EPS: It posted Q2 non-GAAP profit of 54 cents per share, missing the average analyst forecast of 57 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The last profit miss for Oracle was back in the February quarter of 2001, when it missed by 2 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. - Software: new software license revenues are probably Oracle's most closely watched metric, because it indicates future revenue streams. The company pulled in Q2 new software license revenue of $2 billion, missing the Wall Street consensus of $2.2 billion, according to research firm StreetAccount. - Computer equipment: Wall Street is keeping an eye on Oracle's flagging hardware division, which it took on after buying Sun Microsystems. Hardware systems product revenue fell to $953 million, missing the $1.06 billion forecast of analysts polled by StreetAccount. Analysts had expected Oracle to be able to stem declining revenue and turn it around by fiscal 2013. - Services: Revenue from software updates and support unexpectedly declined from Q1 to Q2, dropping nearly 1 percent to $3.99 billion. It was the first sequential decline in three years. The division is one of the most lucrative parts of the company. - Geographically speaking: Europe, Middle East & Africa revenue grew an anemic 0.7 percent to $2.76 billion. Revenue grew about 2 percent in the Americas and 8 percent in Asia Pacific. Source: analysts, company's quarterly report. (Reporting by  Jim Finkle  and  Edwin Chan )
