 HAMBURG, Germany  (Reuters) - The European Central Bank will do everything in its power to show the euro is irreversible, ECB Executive Board member Joerg Asmussen said on Monday. 
 In a speech at a tax advisors' conference in Hamburg, Asmussen added that the ECB saw inflation falling below 2 percent next year. The central bank targets inflation at just below 2 percent, but prices have been rising faster than that for almost two years. He also said there are no "free-riders" among the 17 euro zone countries and that they all know the importance of reforms. (Reporting by Jan Schwartz, writing by Sakari Suoninen)
