 LONDON  (Reuters) - BP said on Monday that it had no problems with its hydrocracker at the Gelsenkirchen refinery in Germany. 
 Trade sources had earlier said the 265,000 barrels-per-day refinery had been affected by an outage in a hydrocracker. The refinery is jointly owned by BP and Rosneft. (Reporting by  Claire Milhench ; Editing by Anthony Barker)
