 DUBLIN  (Reuters) - Ireland's government should resign before the next budget due on December 7, the main opposition party said on Sunday, as cabinet ministers prepared to seek an international rescue to shore up a battered economy. 

 James Reilly, deputy leader of Fine Gael, said the party would consider putting forward a motion of no confidence in the government, and that it feared Ireland's next leaders would be weighed down by a budget set by the current cabinet. The government's dissolution before December 7 would inevitably delay the budget and slow down the process of finalizing an aid deal with the International Monetary Fund, the European Central Bank (ECB) and the European Commission. "Absolutely, they've no credibility to bring in a budget and they're going to hamstring whoever does come in with whatever budget they've made. It's going to be very difficult," Reilly told Reuters when asked whether the government should go before December 7. The government is blamed by many for the country's economic woes, and Ireland is set to become the second euro zone state to seek an aid package from international lenders, a harsh fall for a country once dubbed the "Celtic Tiger" for its strong growth. Fine Gael is one of Ireland's two main opposition parties, along with Labour, and a national vote due in 2011 would almost certainly produce a governing coalition between the two. Prime Minister Brian Cowen's Fianna Fail party is set to lose a parliamentary by-election next week, cutting its lower house majority to just two seats, a poll showed on Wednesday. Reilly said an interim administration could take over from the current government until an election decided a new leadership, a process he said could be done within three weeks. "Everything will be considered," Reilly said, when asked whether his party would support a no confidence vote. "There'll be meetings of the parliamentary party next week. Clearly if any such motions were to go ahead, we'll be talking to the other opposition parties and we'll take a view then." Irish banks, brought to the verge of collapse by exposure to a property and construction sector that crashed after the global financial crisis, have grown dependent on ECB funds and suffered an exodus of deposits over the past six months. As well as negotiate a bailout with international lenders, the government is also set to unveil details next week of a four-year austerity plan to save 15 billion euros ($20.5 billion), which it hopes would help to restore some confidence. Reilly said that for every euro in tax, his party believes there should be three euros in cuts.
