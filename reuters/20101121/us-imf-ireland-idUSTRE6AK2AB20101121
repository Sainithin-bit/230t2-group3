 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The International Monetary Fund stands ready to help Ireland with a multiyear loan and will begin "swift" discussions on an economic program, Managing Director Dominique Strauss-Kahn said on Sunday. 

 "An IMF team, currently in Ireland for technical talks, will now begin to hold swift discussions on an economic program with the Irish authorities, the European Commission and the European Central Bank, Strauss-Kahn said in a statement released after Ireland requested an international bailout.
