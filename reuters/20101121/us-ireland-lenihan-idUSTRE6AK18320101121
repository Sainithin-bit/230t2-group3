 DUBLIN  (Reuters) - Irish Finance Minister Brian Lenihan spoke to local broadcaster RTE on Sunday. 

 Below are a selection of his comments: PROPOSING BAIL OUT "There will be a meeting of the government this afternoon. I will be proposing to my colleagues that we should formally apply for a programme." "I will be recommending to the government that we should apply for a programme and open formal negotiations." STRUCTURAL PROBLEMS "Because of the degree of their dependence and support from the European Central Bank it is essential that we deepen the approach to addressing the structural problems in the banking system." "The banks are well funded as part of the Euro system but they can't remain in that state forever. There have to be structural changes in the banks that put them back on the road." CAPITAL FUND "The focus of the discussions is establishing a capital fund that will demonstrate that the banks have the firepower in the event that further losses materialize in them." CORPORATION TAX "I very much welcome the fact that President Sarkozy indicated yesterday that there is no question of Ireland's corporation tax rates being an issue in these discussion or negotiations. "I very much welcome Chancellor Merkel's similar statement, that has been the view of the Commission, it has been the view of the United Kingdom authorities and it is indeed been the view of the IMF as well. So that issue is off the agenda now, let's be clear about it." CENTRAL BANK SUPPORT "You cannot have a bank system that's just dependent on central bank support - it has to be weaned off central bank support and that's why a detailed structural plan for the resolution of all Irish banking difficulties will be devised as part of the programme." STRESS TESTING "The first step then would be to do detailed stress testing on the institutions concerned and to ensure that their capital position is such that it is robust enough." STATE FUNDING NEEDS "We spent about 19 billion (euros) more as a state than we're bringing in  tax and other receipts. So clearly if the state wasn't able to borrow these monies, we wouldn't be able to function. "So that gap, were the state not in a position to borrow, some facility would have to be available to fill that gap." LOAN SIZE "There isn't a concrete figure, that's discussed in the negotiations." BANK DEPOSIT BASES "Over time the deposit bases can be built up ... over time the banks can be reshaped." "The key issue here, and the key issue all the time for the government, is to ensure we do not have a collapse of the banking sector." STAND-BY FACILITY "The discussions to date have focused on the idea ... of a contingent fund, a stand-by facility of a very large sum. Again, no exact figures have been arrived at. The teams are looking through the balance sheets of the different banks. "And the sum is a contingent sum to display a firepower." AID PACKAGE "Yes of course we're talking about tens of billions." 70, 80, 90 BILLION? "No, nowhere near that. I'm not going to be tied down on figures because the technical group is still looking at the figures. "Whatever figure is arrived at, it will not necessarily be drawn down. It is a figure to demonstrate the kind of support that is available to back up the Irish banking system as part of the Euro system." GOVERNMENT RECOVERY PLAN "The government is finalizing today the four-year plan for national recovery. We will publish that plan during the week and that's the basis of our discussions with the international authorities." MORE ON AID PACKAGE "It certainly will not be a three-figure sum." RECOVERY PLAN SCRUTINY "The (four-year) plan will be examined by the (European) Commission, I have no doubt that the plan will be convincing." CROKE PARK "We have not triggered the emergency clause to repudiate Croke Park, so as far as this forthcoming year is concerned, the Croke Park Agreement stands. If there is an annual review in the arrangement, then clearly it is something that might be discussed. But it's not an issue that has been raised at any stage." CORPORATION TAX "If we interfered with our corporation tax rate, we would inhibit our plan to grow during the planned years." EU/IMF BACKING "Every step we have taken to deal with this crisis since 2008 has been endorsed by the European Union and endorsed by the IMF." GENERAL ELECTION "I do not believe the Irish people should be plunged into a general election in the middle of such an economic crisis, it would be the height of irresponsibility."
