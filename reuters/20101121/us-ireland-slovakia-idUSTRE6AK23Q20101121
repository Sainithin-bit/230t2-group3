 BRATISLAVA  (Reuters) - Ireland has asked for help under the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), a temporary budget safety net, and finance ministers from the group have approved the help, Slovak Finance Minister Ivan Miklos said on Sunday. 

 "Ireland has asked for help from the EFSF and Slovakia has joined other euro zone partners and approved this," he told Reuters. "Slovakia has, however, raised concerns about such mechanisms," he added. (Editing by  David Stamp )
