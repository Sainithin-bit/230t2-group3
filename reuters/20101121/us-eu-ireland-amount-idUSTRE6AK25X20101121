 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - Ireland is likely to get 80 to 90 billion euros ($109-123 billion) in a financial support program from the European Union and the International Monetary Fund, a senior EU source said Sunday. 

 "I would say we are talking about 80-90 billion euros," the source said, adding the sum would include money to support the Irish banking sector. (Reporting by  Jan Strupczewski , editing by Janet Lawrence)
