 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Factory activity in the U.S. Mid-Atlantic region shrank in June for the seventh straight month as manufacturers struggled with flagging demand and surging costs, a regional Federal Reserve survey showed on Thursday. 

 The Philadelphia Fed survey said its business activity index dropped to minus 17.1 in June from minus 15.6 in May. A reading below zero indicates contraction in the region's manufacturing sector and the last time the index was above zero was November 2007. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index at minus 10.0 for June. Survey respondents indicated that the prices they were paying were the highest in more than 27 years, with the prices paid index shooting up to 69.3 in June from 53.8 in May. But in a sign that they were finding it difficult to pass these rising costs on to customers, the index for prices received slipped to 29.7 from 31.6. Meanwhile, the regional employment scene deteriorated for a third consecutive month. The Philadelphia Fed's employment index fell to minus 6.9 from minus 1.0 in May. The survey's other components also showed further weakness in manufacturing activity. The new orders gauge fell to minus 12.4 from minus 3.7 in May, while the shipments barometer declined to minus 6.7 from 2.2 in May. (Reporting by  Richard Leong , Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)
