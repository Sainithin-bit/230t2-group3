 BEIJING  (Reuters) - China's announced increase in electricity tariffs would equal an average of 4.7 percent for affected users, the National Development and Reform Commission said on Thursday. 

 Electricity tariffs would go up by 0.025 yuan/kwh, an increase that will primarily affect industrial and commercial users, NDRC, China's top planning body, said on its website. The increase will be effective from July 1. It added that exemptions will be granted to urban and rural residents along with some farmers and fertilizer producers. (Reporting by  Simon Rabinovitch )
