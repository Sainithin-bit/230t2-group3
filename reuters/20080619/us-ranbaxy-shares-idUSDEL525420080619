 NEW DELHI  (Reuters) - Shares in Indian drugmaker Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd ( RANB.BO ) fell nearly 7 percent on Thursday morning, after a patent dispute settlement with Pfizer Inc ( PFE.N ) was seen as offering no near-term benefit. 

 Brokerages said the settlement also lowered the chances of the U.S. drugmaker making a counter bid for Ranbaxy, India's top drugmaker by sales that has agreed to a friendly takeover by Japan's Daiichi Sankyo ( 4568.T ) in a deal worth up to $4.6 billion. On Wednesday, Pfizer said Ranbaxy can start selling a U.S. generic form of its cholesterol drug Lipitor by late 2011, months later than Wall Street expectations. "Lipitor deal (is) a dampener," CLSA analysts said in a note. "We believe that Ranbaxy's settlement of Lipitor gives Pfizer a lot in terms of profits as it delays the generic entry by 20 months, yet denies Ranbaxy any incremental benefit." At 12:25 p.m. (0655 GMT), Ranbaxy shares were down 5.4 percent at 565.90 in a Mumbai market that had fallen 2 percent. The stock started 2.3 percent higher, but quickly reversed gains and fell as much as 6.9 percent. Ranbaxy's founding Singh family agreed this month to sell its 34.8 percent stake to Daiichi Sankyo, Japan's No. 3 drugmaker, which would also buy up to 20 percent more from other shareholders. Last week, India's Business Standard newspaper said Pfizer may counter Daiichi's offer and bid for about 65 percent held by institutions and public shareholders. Pfizer has declined to comment on the speculation. The patent settlement diminishes the prospect for a counter bid, analysts at Credit Suisse said. "This deal should also end all speculation over Pfizer making a potential bid for Ranbaxy; we always thought it was unlikely, but there were some in the market who thought it was likely," the brokerage said in a note. It also said the Lipitor settlement terms were negative for Ranbaxy. "Lipitor sales are falling in the U.S., so a delay reduces the market; 20-month delay reduces the present value of opportunity," analysts Neelkanth Mishra, Anubhav Aggarwal and Vikramaditya Narendra said in the note. "Given Ranbaxy's relatively strong position on Lipitor and the deeper pockets of Daiichi, we are surprised by the settlement as there appears to be no near-term upside for Ranbaxy," said JP Morgan, who has a 553 rupees price target for the stock by October, 7.6 percent lower than its Wednesday close. Daiichi Sankyo said earlier this week its open offer to buy up to 20 percent at 737 rupees a share would start on August 8 and that the last date for a competitive bid for Ranbaxy was July 7. CLSA analysts said the stock was "fairly valued" and was likely to remain rangebound until the open offer. Ranbaxy shares have fallen nearly 33 percent so far in 2008, underperforming the broader market which has lost a quarter of its value.
