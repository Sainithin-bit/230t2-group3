 CAMBRIDGE, Massachusetts  (Reuters) - Biogen Idec Inc ( BIIB.O ) said on Thursday it has won a proxy fight against billionaire investor Carl Icahn, placing the biotechnology company on course to continue as an independent entity. 

 Alexander Denner, managing director of the Icahn investment vehicle, Icahn Partners, and one of Icahn's nominees to the board, congratulated Biogen on its victory at the company's annual meeting held in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Icahn was not present. Biogen's shares fell as much as 2 percent before recovering to gain 0.84 percent in afternoon trading. Shareholders elected to the board Cecil Pickett, Biogen's president of research and development; Lynn Schenk, an attorney; and Phillip Sharp, a Nobel prize-winner who helped found Biogen 30 years ago. They also elected Stelios Papadopoulos, a retired vice chairman of Cowen & Co, to replace Thomas Keller, who is reaching retirement age. Icahn sought to place three members on the company's board in a bid to push Cambridge-based Biogen to try again to sell itself. He had nominated Richard Mulligan, professor of genetics at Harvard Medical School; Dr. Anne Young, head of the neurology service at Massachusetts General Hospital; and Denner. Icahn claims Biogen deliberately sabotaged a previous attempt to sell itself in part by not allowing potential buyers to talk to its partners, Elan Corp Plc ( ELN.I ) of Ireland and biotechnology company Genentech Inc DNA.N. Biogen, which sells the multiple sclerosis drugs Avonex and Tysabri, and the cancer drug Rituxan, has denied the charge, saying it conducted a responsible auction, but that no buyer was interested in acquiring the company for an acceptable price. Icahn's failure begs the question what will he do next. Alexander Denner said in an interview that his group had several large shareholders with active portfolio managers in its corner, a group Biogen cannot afford to alienate. That could allow for some negotiations under which the Icahn group receives some concessions such as cost-cutting that might go some way to assuaging its concerns. "I don't think Biogen is above the fray in terms of cost-cutting," said Bret Holley, an analyst at Oppenheimer & Co. "But my suspicion is that this is likely to end the near term speculations that Biogen is going to be bought any time soon." For the time being, the pressure to put itself up for sale has abated. "We look forward to turning our undivided attention to delivering strong performance and growing our business for stockholders," Biogen Chairman Bruce Ross said in a statement. Shareholders also defeated a proposal by Icahn to permanently limit the board to 12 members. The stock was up 49 cents to $58.99 on Nasdaq after falling as low as $57.28 earlier in the session.
