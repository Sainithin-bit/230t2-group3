 LONDON  (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs ( GS.N ) on Thursday raised its 2008 average Brent crude oil price forecast to $117.40 a barrel from a $108 due to tight supplies. 

 "We have increased our price forecasts to reflect a continued tightening of global crude oil supply/demand fundamentals and the resulting higher oil prices," the U.S. investment bank said. Goldman expected Brent crude would rise to an average $140 in 2009 and peak at $150 in 2010. Prices would ease to an average $140 in 2011 and $85 in 2012, the bank said. (Reporting by  Ikuko Kao )
