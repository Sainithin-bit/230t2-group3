 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. Justice Department officials are expected to announce the results of a national mortgage fraud enforcement operation at their news conference scheduled for 1:15 p.m. EDT , a department official said on Thursday. 

 The official described the effort as a "national coordinated operation to combat mortgage fraud," that dealt with individual rather than corporate fraud cases. The announcement comes as two former Bear Stearns fund managers were indicted on fraud charges in connection with the $1.4 billion collapse of two funds related to the subprime lending crisis. The official said the department is aware of the indictments, but declined further comment. (Reporting by  Randall Mikkelsen , editing by Vicki Allen)
