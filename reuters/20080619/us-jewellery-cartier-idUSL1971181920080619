 LONDON  (Reuters) - Sales at the Manhattan stores of jewellery brand Cartier, a subsidiary of Swiss luxury goods maker Richemont ( CFR.VX ), are holding up despite the economic downturn, a senior company official said. 

 "Sales are doing well -- Cartier is a high-end business and, therefore, better protected," Frederic de Narp, president and CEO, Cartier North America, told Reuters in an email this week. He gave no figures. "In times like this it's even more important for people to buy something meaningful with value and lasting power that will reassure," De Narp said. Cartier has seen increased traffic from foreign visitors, especially in its Fifth Avenue boutique in New York. Bridal jewellery sales are performing well in Manhattan. "People will never stop celebrating special occasions and milestones in their life like marriages, birthdays, anniversaries," De Narp said. Cartier has not noticed any slowdown in the sales of its jewellery based on the rising cost of precious raw materials, he added. "Our iconic collection including Love and Trinity collections, both in 18-carat gold, continue to be best sellers for the brand," he said. (Reporting by  David Brough ; editing by Sue Thomas)
