 LONDON  (Reuters) - Governments and state oil 
companies across the globe are bearing much of the brunt of 
record high oil prices on behalf of consumers, helping stoke 
demand in China and Brazil and weighing heavily on budgets from 
Indonesia and Mexico. 

 But many Asia governments such as India and Malaysia are 
finding they're no longer able to bear the full burden, forcing 
them to raise prices in order to cut subsidy costs. Latest on the fray is China. Beijing announced on Thursday 
it would raise its nationwide pump diesel and gasoline prices by 
1,000 yuan a tonne, or about 18 and 17 percent respectively from 
June 20th -- the first rise since November.  Find below details of major countries in Asia and Latin 
America that subsidize their fuel prices and what it costs them 
to do so.
 ***************************************************************  CHINA     RETAIL GASOLINE PRICE: $0.72/litre for 93-octane;                         $0.67/litre for 90-octane      RETAIL DIESEL PRICE:   $0.70/litre      LAST INCREASES: 10 pct on November 1 2007      RISE SINCE JAN 2003: gasoline prices by 67 pct, diesel by 71 
pct. <ID:nSP263366>      SUBSIDY BORNE BY: Top refiner Sinopec Corp ( 0386.HK ) and, to 
a lesser degree, upstream heavyweight PetroChina ( 0857.HK ). COST OF SUBSIDY: $1.37 billion payout to Sinopec in 2005                   $685 million payout to Sinopec in 2006  Sinopec also won around 4.9 billion yuan for losses in 2007, 
and 7.4 billion for the first quarter of 2008.      SUBSIDY AS PCT OF TOTAL GOVT BUDGET COSTS: 2.9 pct in 2005;                                             0.1 pct in 2006  TOTAL OIL DEMAND (2008): 7.9 million bpd      OUTLOOK - Beijing is focused on fighting high inflation and 
has repeatedly said it will not raise energy prices in the short 
term. But serious fuel shortages are cropping up all over the 
country which forced the announcement of the hike.
 ****************************************************************  INDIA      RETAIL GASOLINE PRICE: $1.19/litre      RETAIL DIESEL PRICE: $0.81/litre      LAST INCREASES: Gasoline by 11 percent and diesel by 9.5 
percent in June 2008      RISE SINCE JAN 2003: 67 pct for gasoline, 77 pct for diesel  SUBSIDY BORNE BY: Government, state-run upstream companies, 
and state-run retailers      COST OF SUBSIDY: not immediately available.      SUBSIDY AS PCT OF TOTAL GOVT BUDGET COSTS: n/a      TOTAL OIL DEMAND: 2.9 million bpd      OUTLOOK: India raised its petrol and diesel prices by about 
10 percent on June 4 to curb losses at its state-owned refiners. 
Although the higher prices may help temper fuel demand at the 
margins, analysts have said that rapid economic growth and 
rising salaries may blunt the effect of a modest price from 
India, where oil demand rose 7 percent last year, its fastest 
rate in 8 years.
 ****************************************************************  INDONESIA      RETAIL SUBSIDISED GASOLINE PRICE: $0.645/litre for 88-octane  RETAIL SUBSIDISED DIESEL PRICE:   $0.591/litre      LAST INCREASES: 28.7 percent increase in May 2008      RISE SINCE OCT 2005: 125 percent.      SUBSIDY BORNE BY: the central government      COST OF SUBSIDY: $9.31 billion in 2007; $13.5 billion in 
2008      SUBSIDY AS PCT OF TOTAL GOVT BUDGET COSTS: 13 percent.  TOTAL OIL DEMAND: 674,000 bpd of subsidized fuel; just over 
1 million bpd of total oil demand      OUTLOOK: The government raised subsidized fuel price in May 
24, 2008 and it plans to introduce smart card to ration fuel 
consumption. The smart card may be introduced in September 2008.
 ****************************************************************  MALAYSIA      RETAIL GASOLINE PRICE: $0.833/litre      RETAIL DIESEL PRICE:   $0.796/litre      LAST INCREASES: gasoline 40.6 pct      SUBSIDY BORNE BY: government      COST OF SUBSIDY: Malaysia is a net oil exporter and earns 
250 million ringgit ($77.6 million) a year in revenue for every 
$1 rise in crude prices. Domestic Trade Minister Shahrir Samad 
said earlier this year that fuel subsidy would cost the 
government as much as 56 billion ringgit this year, or about a 
third of government expenditure in 2008. SUBSIDY AS PCT OF TOTAL GOVT BUDGET COSTS: n/a      TOTAL OIL DEMAND: 517,000 bpd      OUTLOOK: Malaysia said it would scrap fuel price controls in 
August in a move that could double Asia's second-cheapest pump 
prices and stoke inflation already at 15-month highs.
 ***************************************************************  VIETNAM      RETAIL GASOLINE PRICE: $0.90/litre      RETAIL DIESEL PRICE:   $0.86/litre      LAST INCREASES: 12 percent on Feb 25      RISE SINCE JAN 2004: 186 percent for gasoline, 263 percent 
for diesel.      SUBSIDY BORNE BY: government      COST OF SUBSIDY: about $500 million in Jan-May period.  SUBSIDY AS PCT OF TOTAL GOVT BUDGET COSTS: 6 percent  TOTAL OIL DEMAND: 270,000 bpd      OUTLOOK: The government said in 2008 that it planned to stop 
subsidizing distillates from 2008 but since then suspended the 
plan as it moved to battle double-digit inflation. Hanoi has 
kept a lid on retail fuel prices since late February but has 
said it is considering allowing prices to rise from July to ease 
the burden on government budget.  ** LATIN AMERICA 
************************************************  VENEZUELA      RETAIL UNLEADED GASOLINE PRICE: $0.033 per liter   PRICE RISE AT LAST ADJUSTMENT: 27 percent in July 1997  COUNTRY'S OIL DEMAND:  Around 600,000 bpd      SUBSIDY BORNE BY: State oil company PDVSA      COST OF SUBSIDY: No official figure. Estimates range from 
$10 to over $20 bln per year. Government estimates 27,000 bpd 
lost to smuggling, costing some $1 billion per year.
 ****************************************************************  BRAZIL      RETAIL GASOLINE PRICE: $1.50      RETAIL DIESEL PRICE: $1.22 a liter (500 PPM)      PRICE CHANGE AT LAST ADJUSTMENT: On May 2. A 15 percent rise 
for diesel and 10 percent for gasoline.      RISE SINCE JAN 2003: gasoline around 45 pct, diesel around 
60 pct.      COUNTRY'S OIL DEMAND; around 1.8 mln bpd.      SUBSIDY BORNE BY: State-run oil firm Petrobras 
( PETR4.SA )( PBR.N )      OUTLOOK: The government reduced anticyclical CIDE tax when 
it last adjusted prices to avoid gasoline price rise at the 
pump. Steep appreciation in the Brazilian currency, the real, 
over the past three years had minimized losses for Petrobras 
stemming from the oil price rally.
 ****************************************************************  MEXICO      RETAIL GASOLINE PRICE: $0.69 per liter (MAGNA GRADE)  RETAIL DIESEL PRICE: $0.59 a liter.      PRICE CHANGE AT LAST ADJUSTMENT: 0.5 percent rise in

around 24 pct      COUNTRY'S OIL DEMAND: around 750,000 bpd of gasoline and 
425,000 bpd of diesel.      SUBSIDY BORNE BY: The government.
