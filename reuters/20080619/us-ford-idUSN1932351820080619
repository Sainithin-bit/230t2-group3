 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Billionaire investor Kirk Kerkorian raised his stake in Ford Motor Co ( F.N ) to 6.5 percent this week and said he was willing to support the automaker's turnaround with an infusion of additional capital. 

 Kerkorian, who has now invested about $1 billion in Ford, had disclosed a stake of 5.5 percent last week after completing a tender offer which was massively oversubscribed. A long-time activist investor in the auto industry, he could step in to propose business strategies for Ford as it attempts to turn around its money-losing U.S. operations, according to a filing by his Tracinda Corp investment vehicle on Thursday. The additional purchases of Ford stock by Tracinda signal a bigger bet on Ford's turnaround even after a more than 25 percent drop in its shares over the past two months, and raise the likelihood that Kerkorian could emerge as an activist investor at the No. 2 U.S. automaker. Kerkorian, 91, previously had held a nearly 10 percent stake in General Motors Corp ( GM.N ) for a short stint, during which he pushed for changes at the No. 1 automaker. He was also a major Chrysler Corp shareholder when it was independent and last year made a failed bid for Chrysler LLC. Any additional capital from Kerkorian would be to give Ford more flexibility as it restructures, Tracinda said in the filing with U.S. securities regulators. Kerkorian's offer of additional capital raises questions about the long-term control of the company by the Ford family, which owns just 3 percent of the automaker's stock. Shares of Ford, which tumbled on Wednesday on signs of a weakening U.S. auto market in June, were down 4 cents at $6.18 in morning New York Stock Exchange trade. MEETING WITH MANAGEMENT The Tracinda filing comes two days after Ford Chief Executive Alan Mulally and Executive Chairman Bill Ford met with Kerkorian to discuss the automaker's turnaround plan. Tracinda surprised auto industry analysts and Ford executives by announcing in April that it had begun to acquire a stake in the automaker. In the Thursday filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Tracinda said a series of stock purchases over the past two months, including about 18.7 million in the open market, had given it a total of 140.8 million shares in Ford, or a 6.49 percent stake. Of those additional open market purchases, Tracinda bought about 10.4 million shares on Tuesday and Wednesday, the day of the meeting with Mulally and just after. The Ford family holds a 3 percent stake, but controls 40 percent of the voting power because of a separate class of shares established when the company went public in 1956. In May, Ford abandoned a long-standing goal of returning to profitability in 2009, saying the U.S. market had shifted permanently away from trucks and SUVs. In response, the company is cutting 15 percent of its white-collar expenses in North America and shifting production out of its truck and SUV plants. Tracinda's investment in Ford comes at a time when U.S. auto industry sales have fallen to their lowest level in a decade in the face of record gasoline prices. Ford's U.S. sales were down 12 percent through May, and analysts expect industry-wide June sales to be the weakest of the year and the current downturn. Tracinda acquired a stake in Ford's larger rival, GM, that began as a passive investment three years ago, but it quickly pushed for changes that included naming Kerkorian's auto industry advisor, Jerry York, to the board. When GM rejected Kerkorian's suggestion for an alliance with Renault-Nissan, York left the board and Kerkorian sold his nearly 10 percent stake. Some analysts have suggested that Ford could move faster toward a sale of its Volvo brand or a closure of its Mercury line with prompting from Kerkorian. York, Kerkorian's aide on automotive investments, earlier suggested Ford could dispose of both the brands. He later apologized for what he called "off-the-cuff" remarks to a reporter. Kerkorian got a close look at Ford last summer under a confidentiality agreement to prepare an unsuccessful offer for Ford's luxury Jaguar and Land Rover brands. Ford ultimately sold the brands to India's Tata Motors ( TAMO.BO ). Kerkorian also agreed at the time not to make investments in Ford through March 2008. He began to amass a 100 million share stake in Ford on April 2. York met with Ford executives two days later, but did not tell Ford about the stock purchases or planned tender offer until late April. Bernie McGinn of Alexandria, Virginia-based McGinn Investment Management, who bought Ford shares after the 2006 appointment of Mulally as CEO, said he viewed Kerkorian's investment as a positive for the automaker. "He can hire the best and brightest analysts out there, so clearly he has insights his money can buy," said McGinn, who focuses on long-term contrarian investments in large capitalization stocks and did not tender any shares to Tracinda.
