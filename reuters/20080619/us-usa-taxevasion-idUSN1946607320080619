 FORT LAUDERDALE, Florida  (Reuters) - A former UBS AG ( UBSN.VX ) banker who once smuggled a client's diamonds into the United States in a toothpaste tube pleaded guilty on Thursday to helping a billionaire hide $200 million in assets from U.S. tax authorities. 

 Bradley Birkenfeld, a 43-year-old U.S. citizen, told a court in Fort Lauderdale that he was a UBS banker at the time, received a large salary, and was "incentivized" by his employer to carry out the activities that led to the charges. He had previously pleaded not guilty. His change of heart and subsequent plea deal could affect a continuing U.S. investigation of UBS's conduct in relation to services it provided to U.S. clients from 2000 through 2007, and could crack open Switzerland's much-vaunted tradition of banking secrecy. "He's going to tell the government everything he knows about what was going on at UBS," Birkenfeld's lead attorney, Danny Onorato, told reporters after his court appearance. U.S. media have reported that UBS, Switzerland's biggest bank and long known as a zealous guardian of its customers' privacy and money, is considering whether to reveal the names of up to 20,000 wealthy American clients as federal authorities intensify their probe into offshore bank accounts. The probe could mark another big setback for UBS, which has been the hardest-hit European victim of the U.S. subprime mortgage crisis with losses totaling $37 billion so far. It could also become an embarrassment for Phil Gramm, the former Republican senator from Texas who is now vice chairman of UBS Securities and an economic adviser to Republican presidential hopeful Sen. John McCain. In evidence he gave the court, Birkenfeld said he and other UBS bankers helped the bank earn $200 million a year managing $20 billion in assets held in offshore tax havens and concealed from the U.S. tax authorities by wealthy Americans, the federal prosecutor's office for the Southern District of Florida said. "Mr Birkenfeld had numerous U.S. clients. A number of these individuals have been reaching out to U.S. authorities as a result of Mr Birkenfeld's case," Onorato said. DIAMONDS IN A TUBE Unsealed last month, the grand jury indictment against Birkenfeld charged him with conspiring to defraud the United States by helping a billionaire U.S. real estate developer create bogus corporations and other entities to conceal the ownership of hidden offshore assets. In a seven-page statement of facts, Birkenfeld said he and other bankers helped wealthy clients set up sham entities to hold their assets in offshore financial centers, such as Switzerland, Panama, the British Virgin Islands, Hong Kong and Liechtenstein. According to the statement, the bankers then filed false and misleading U.S. tax forms and also helped clients place cash and valuables in Swiss safety deposit boxes, buy jewelry, artwork and luxury items, and use Swiss credit cards they thought could not be traced by U.S. authorities. "On one occasion, at the request of a U.S. client, defendant Birkenfeld purchased diamonds using that U.S. client's Swiss bank account funds and smuggled the diamonds into the United States in a toothpaste tube," the statement of facts said. A source close to the case said the billionaire, identified in the indictment only by the initials I.O., was real estate developer Igor Olenicoff, who pleaded guilty in December to filing a false 2002 tax return. Prosecutors say he evaded more than $7 million in income taxes. The source, who asked not to be identified, said UBS was widely expected to strike a deal with the U.S. Department of Justice. UBS declined to comment on Birkenfeld. But in a statement on Thursday it said it was working with Swiss and U.S. government authorities and treating the probe into services it provided to U.S. clients "with the utmost seriousness." Birkenfeld, who faces up to five years' imprisonment, is due to be sentenced on August 13 before U.S. District Judge William Zloch. Clad in a pin-striped gray suit and looking every bit the banker during a half-hour court appearance on Thursday, Birkenfeld said his only previous run-in with the law occurred in 1983 when he was arrested on drug charges while in high school. Birkenfeld's co-defendant, Swiss banker Mario Staggl, is believed to be in Liechtenstein. (Additional reporting by Kathy Skipper; Editing by  Michael Christie  and John Wallace)
