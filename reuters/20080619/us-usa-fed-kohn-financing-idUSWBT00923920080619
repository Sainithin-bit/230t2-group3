 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Donald Kohn said policy-makers were considering a number of alternatives for the period when temporary lending facilities for banks expire. 

 Kohn was responding to questions at a Senate banking Committee about what happens when an emergency lending facility for investment banks expires in September. "We are looking at this issue right now and have a number of alternatives under consideration and we are talking about this within the Federal Reserve and I'm not prepared to say something right now," Kohn said. But he added that the fed and the Securities and Exchange Commission were in consultation. At this stage, he said, they were "look(ing) at this period of bridging to potential legislative action and even if those liquidity facilities are wound down, we would expect still to have a cooperative relationship with the SEC."
