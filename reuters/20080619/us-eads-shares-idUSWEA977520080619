 PARIS  (Reuters) - Shares in European aerospace group EADS ( EAD.PA ) fell sharply on Thursday after U.S. auditors urged its Air Force to rerun a competition for a $35 billion contract initially won by EADS and Northrop Grumman ( NOC.N ). 

 EADS shares at one stage fell as much as 4.4 percent to an intraday low of 12.96 euros -- its worst level since touching a near 5-year low of 12.83 euros in March. The stock was down 2.6 percent at 13.20 euros by 4:13 a.m. EDT, but EADS remained among the main losers on France's benchmark CAC-40 index  .FCHI , which was down 0.4 percent. The probe into the U.S. Air Force aircraft-refueling order came after protests by EADS' archrival Boeing Co ( BA.N ), which had lost out in the bid process. French brokerage CM-CIC Securities said the U.S. challenge to the contract would lead to a short-term negative reaction to EADS shares. CM-CIC added that EADS also faced ongoing concerns over problems with its A380 and A400M planes and the weakness of the dollar, which hurts exports from European countries. Oddo Securities cut its price target on EADS to 16.5 euros from 20 euros, although it kept an "add" rating on the stock. Oddo said that EADS might now want to speed up its plans to do takeovers in the United States, in order to recover from this setback in the important American defense market. French politician Bernard Carayon, a member of President Nicolas Sarkozy's ruling right-wing UMP party, criticized the U.S. decision to challenge the EADS/Northrop contract. "The challenge to the air refueling contract by the U.S. Government Accountability Office is a blow to our transatlantic relations," he said in a statement. The French government takes a keen interest in the affairs of EADS since the company's Airbus unit is one of the country's biggest employers. The French government owns 15 percent of EADS. French media group Lagardere ( LAGA.PA ) is in the process of halving its 15 percent stake to 7.5 percent while German company Daimler ( DAIGn.DE ) owns 22.5 percent. EADS shares have fallen by roughly 40 percent since the start of 2008, adding to a 16 percent fall last year.
