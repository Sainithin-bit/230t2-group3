 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Robert Willumstad, chief executive at 
American International Group Inc ( AIG.N ), said he had a 
"positive" first meeting with former CEO Maurice "Hank" 
Greenberg on Thursday. 

  The two met in New York four days after Willumstad, AIG 
chairman and a former Citigroup Inc ( C.N ) executive, took over 
as CEO at the world's largest insurer, replacing Martin 
Sullivan, who succeeded Greenberg in 2005.  Sullivan stepped down last weekend after the company racked 
up record losses from bad mortgage bets and investors pushed 
for his ouster.  Willumstad said one of the first things he wanted to do in 
his new position was establish an "interactive" relationship 
with Greenberg, who ran the insurer for nearly four decades but 
has had a strained relationship with AIG since leaving.  Greenberg, through a spokesman, declined to comment on 
their discussions. Willumstad said only that the meeting was 
"positive."  Greenberg, who quit AIG amid an accounting scandal but 
remains a large shareholder, has been scathing in his criticism 
of management in recent months as losses mounted and the stock 
price plummeted. There are also a string of lawsuits 
outstanding between the two sides.  Willumstad's meeting with Greenberg is seen as a step 
toward addressing Greenberg's grievances and bridging the 
divide that developed between each side over the past three 
years.  Greenberg controls more than 12 percent of AIG shares 
through a personal stake, family trusts, and control of 
companies that are AIG's largest shareholders.  (Reporting by  Lilla Zuill ; editing by Jeffrey Benkoe)
