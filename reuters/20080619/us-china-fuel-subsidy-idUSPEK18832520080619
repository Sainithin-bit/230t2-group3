 BEIJING  (Reuters) - China pledged to subsidize vulnerable groups such as farmers, fishermen and taxi drivers to cope with the near 18 percent rise in fuel prices, the state television said on Thursday. 

 China announced a surprise increase by 1,000 yuan per metric ton for both gasoline and diesel effective June 20, the first increase in eight months and the biggest one-off hike barely two months from the Beijing Olympics. (Reporting by Chen Aizhu;)
