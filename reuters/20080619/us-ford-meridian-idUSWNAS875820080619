 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co ( F.N ) has terminated a deal to sell an auto lighting plant it took back from former subsidiary Visteon Corp ( VC.N ), the company that had been scheduled to take over the plant said on Thursday. 

 Meridian Automotive Systems said Ford had terminated a tentative agreement to transfer the Sandusky, Ohio, lighting plant because the downturn in U.S. auto sales no longer made the deal possible on the original terms. Ford reached an agreement to sell the lighting business to privately held Meridian Automotive, based in Allen Park, Michigan, a year ago. Terms were not disclosed. Ford had said the deal was contingent on reaching a contract with the United Auto Workers that would reduce operating costs at the plant. (Reporting by  Kevin Krolicki ; editing by John Wallace)
