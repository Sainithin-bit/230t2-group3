 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - British Airways BAY.L will launch a new airline on Thursday that will link New York to continental Europe, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday. 

 The paper said the move is an attempt to capitalize on the recent deregulation of trans-Atlantic air travel. A British Airways spokesperson was not immediately available. (Reporting by  Yinka Adegoke ; Editing by Ben Tan)
