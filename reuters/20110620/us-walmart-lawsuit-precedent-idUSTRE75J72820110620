 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The Supreme Court threw out Monday a massive class-action sex-discrimination lawsuit against Wal-Mart Stores Inc, the biggest such case ever, in a major victory for the world's largest retailer and for big business in general. 

 Like nearly all Supreme Court decisions, the justices' opinions in the Wal-Mart case are patchworks of legal precedent, weaving in previous opinions penned at the high court and at lower courts. Most of the cases the justices cited were from the 1970s and 1980s, showing how long the court has gone without deciding crucial questions in the area of employment discrimination law, said Michael Selmi of the George Washington University Law School. "One of the interesting aspects of this area is how it has flown under the radar for many years," said Selmi. Below are some cases the justices cited in their opinions. Teamsters v. United States Decided: 1977. This case, a cornerstone of how plaintiffs must prove a pattern or practice of discrimination, was cited at least three times by Justice Antonin Scalia to demonstrate what he called the "weak" anecdotal evidence put forth by plaintiffs. He noted that the plaintiffs suing Wal-Mart offered comparatively less evidence than the government did in its case against the Teamsters. "Basically they are saying, the proof that might work with a couple hundred people doesn't come close to working here," said Gerald Maatman, a partner at Seyfarth Shaw, which defends companies in employment class actions. Today's opinion, said Maatman, brings the Teamsters case into the "modern era." General Telephone Co. of Southwest v. Falcon Decided: 1982. This case set forth some of the guidelines governing the commonality standard for class certification. The case was heavily relied upon in Monday's majority opinion, yet it is more than 20 years old, demonstrating how decades had elapsed since the high court last decided a major employment case, said Selmi of George Washington law school. "The majority took the most restrictive reading in Falcon. It's not outlandish or surprising," said Alexandra Lahav, a professor at the University of Connecticut School of Law, and the justices relied on a footnote in that opinion to back up their interpretation of Falcon. "They really cottoned on to that." Cooper v. Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond Decided: 1984 This opinion said the linchpin of an employment case inquiry is to find "the reason for a particular employment decision." In citing the Federal Reserve Bank case, Scalia referenced the Wal-Mart case: "Respondents wish to sue for millions of employment decisions at once." Leisner v. New York Tel. Co. Decided: 1973 Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg cited this case, from the federal trial court in New York, to demonstrate a "prototypical" case about how managers select employees; "it is hardly surprising that for many managers, the ideal candidate was someone with characteristics similar to their own," Ginsburg wrote, referring to the findings in Leisner. That case doesn't necessarily resonate with employment attorneys. "That's a footnote in history," said Maatman of Seyfarth Shaw. "I think it's one of those things on the dusty bookshelf no one has looked at in a long time." (Reporting by Carlyn Kolker; Editing by Eileen Daspin and  Todd Eastham )
