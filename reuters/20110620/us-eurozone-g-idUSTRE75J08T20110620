 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Group of Seven finance leaders held a teleconference over the weekend to discuss the Greek debt crisis, Japanese Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda said on Monday. 

 In Luxembourg, euro zone finance ministers postponed a final decision on extending a further 12 billion euros ($17 billion) in emergency loans to Greece, saying Athens would first have to introduce harsh austerity measures. The ministers said in a statement that they expected to pay the money by mid-July, but they insisted that disbursement would depend on the Greek parliament first passing laws on fiscal reforms and selling off state assets. Greek officials have said the country will face default in mid-July if the European Union and the International Monetary Fund do not hand over that tranche by then. Rintaro Tamaki, vice finance minister for international affairs, participated in the telephone call from Japan, Noda told reporters. Greece, with a public debt worth more than 150 percent of its annual economic output and rising, missed debt targets in its initial bailout plan partly because of a deep recession. Prime Minister George Papandreou, besieged by public protests, on Sunday asked Greeks to accept tax hikes, spending cuts and privatisation plans which international donors have demanded as a condition for the aid. Papandreou, whose reshuffled cabinet faces a confidence vote on Tuesday, austerity steps were necessary to avoid a "catastrophic" default. In the proposed new bailout scheme, private investors would for the first time share the burden, pledging to maintain their exposure to Greece by voluntarily buying about 30 billion euros of sovereign bonds as their current holdings matured. But such a debt rollover would be complex and controversial, financially and legally and key details have not been worked out yet.
