 LE BOURGET, France  (Reuters) - Qatar Airways will announce an order for one or more Boeing Co 777 aircraft later on Monday at the Paris Air Show, a person with knowledge of the order said. 

 Demand for aircraft is on a sharp rebound driven by demand from Asia's rapidly growing airports and the Middle East. (Reporting by Kyle Peterson; Editing by  James Regan )
