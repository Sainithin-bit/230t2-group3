 LE BOURGET, France  (Reuters) - GE Capital Aviation Services (GECAS), the commercial aircraft leasing and financing arm of General Electric, ordered 15 72-600s, plus 15 options, from turboprop maker ATR. 

 The deal is valued at about $680 million at list prices, including the options, the companies said at the Paris Air Show on Monday. "There is good demand in the emerging markets and a strong replacement need as well," Norman Liu, chief executive of GECAS, said. ATR is a joint venture of EADS and Finmeccanica.
