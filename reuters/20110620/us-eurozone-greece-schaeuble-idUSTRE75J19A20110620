 BERLIN  (Reuters) - German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said on Monday that private creditor participation in another bailout for Greece has to be voluntary to avoid triggering a credit event. 

 "The participation of the private sector... has to voluntary, because if it is not voluntary then it will be according to all rules also of credit insurance a credit event and that will lead to a downgrade of Greece immediately," Schaeuble told German radio station Deutschlandfunk. Schaeuble emphasized what euro zone finance ministers agreed on  Sunday when they postponed a final decision on extending 12 billion euros ($17.07 billion) in emergency loans to Greece, saying Athens would first have to introduce harsh austerity measures. "If the Greeks do not want to or cannot make the necessary decision, then this route cannot be pursued," Schaeuble said with reference to further payouts. Any Greek debt rollover would be complex and controversial, financially and legally, and key details have not been worked out. The meeting of euro zone finance ministers in Luxembourg continues on Monday. German news magazine Der Spiegel on Sunday reported that Schaeuble intended to propose a compromise over the bailout to the European Central Bank, which has opposed private sector involvement in any new Greek aid. Schaeuble on Monday made clear that private creditors such as banks cannot rely on the state to bailout Greece and urged all parties involved in the negotiations to carry their weight. "If we cannot avoid a dramatic turn of events then everybody will be affected," Schaeuble said. (Reporting by  Eva Kuehnen )
