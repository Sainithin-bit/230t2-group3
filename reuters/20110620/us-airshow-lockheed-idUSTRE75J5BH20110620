 LE BOURGET  (Reuters) - Lockheed Martin Corp's aeronautics chief still expects the company to sell F-16 fighters to Oman and Iraq and said other international deals could extend production of the multi-role jet. 

 "There are a couple of other opportunities that we're still looking at that we really can't mention at the moment that could continue the production line even further," Ralph Heath said in an interview at the Paris Air Show on Monday. Lockheed has been gradually winding down the F-16 as it ramps up production of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. Current plans call for the U.S. Defense Department to buy 2,443 radar-evading F-35s. "We don't see anything at the moment that is changing that," Heath said. (Reporting by  Karen Jacobs ; Editing by  James Regan )
