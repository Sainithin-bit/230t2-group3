 PARIS  (Reuters) - Boeing is leaning toward redesigning its 737 narrow-body jetliner rather than simply putting on more efficient engines, Chief Executive Jim McNerney said in a newspaper interview published on Monday. 

 Boeing is aiming to make a decision on the future of its hottest selling plane by the end of the year, McNerney told reporters on the eve of the Paris Air Show on Sunday. "We're leaning toward a new plane, but the two possibilities are still under consideration," McNerney told Le Monde newspaper. The company has said repeatedly that it is leaning toward a full redesign if it can accomplish the task and deliver the planes to customers as promised. A re-engined plane could be brought to market quicker, but a redesigned plane could offer better efficiency. European rival Airbus has already bet on a version of its competing A320 family of aircraft with more fuel-efficient engines, known as the A320neo. Boeing's decision will be crucial as the two rivals battle it out in the largest aircraft segment. (Reporting by  Christian Plumb ; Editing by  James Regan )
