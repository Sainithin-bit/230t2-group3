 VIENNA  (Reuters) - Japan's economy will suffer major damage if it reduces output from nuclear power stations to zero in the wake of the Fukushima disaster, its trade minister said on Monday. 

 Routine maintenance and public concern since the Fukushima accident on March 11 have left only 19 of Japan's 54 reactors functioning. "I am fairly convinced that those operating plants can continue operation and those that are shut down for inspection can be resumed," Banri Kaieda told reporters at a Vienna conference on boosting global nuclear safety. He said if nuclear power was to be reduced to zero, "that could have a major adverse impact on the Japanese industries as well as on Japan's economy." "Should there be a sudden brake applied on the Japanese economy that could have a very big impact upon the global economy as a whole," he said. Kaieda said companies and authorities were working to rebuild manufacturing capacity and infrastructure in the region as a way to restore a supply chain whose disruption sent ripples around the world, especially in the car sector. "It is not fully recovered 100 percent in some of the industrial sectors...but having said that the chains in the supply chain are now linked to each other," he said. "This has been  taking place faster than had originally been anticipated so you can see from this experience that Japanese industries, in particular Japanese manufacturing industries, will be able to recover and reconstruct from the second half of this year," he said through an interpreter. He said it was crucial to find enough funding to rebuild infrastructure in the region hit by a big earthquake and tsunami despite fiscal constraints on the Japanese government. Even after reconstruction, Japanese industry has to cope with a strong yen and high commodity prices, he said, and noted that Japan had been able to respond to such shocks in the past. "I am confident that we will be able to do so and come out stronger like a phoenix from this devastating situation." (Reporting by  Sylvia Westall  and  Michael Shields ; Editing by  Louise Ireland )
