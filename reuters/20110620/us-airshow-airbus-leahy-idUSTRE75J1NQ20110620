 LE BOURGET, France  (Reuters) - European planemaker Airbus will sell more planes this year than it did in 2010, sales chief John Leahy said at the Paris Air Show on Monday. 

 "I can't make a forecast at this point but I would say it will be better than last year," Leahy told Reuters. (Reporting by Matthias Blamont; Editing by  James Regan )
