 LE BOURGET, France  (Reuters) - Boeing plans to compete strongly in unmanned military aircraft, the president of the U.S. company's military aircraft division, Chris Chadwick, told Reuters at the Paris Air Show on Monday. 

 "The barriers to entry in the unmanned airborne system arena are fairly low," Chadwick said. "While there were and are some market leaders, we think that will continue to change quite a lot." He added that he saw international growth opportunities for the Chinook helicopter and Super Hornet fighter programs. (Reporting by  Karen Jacobs ; Editing by  James Regan )
