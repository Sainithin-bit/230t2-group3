 LE BOURGET, France  (Reuters) - Airbus won an order for 60 A320neo planes from GE Capital Aviation Services (GECAS), the commercial aircraft leasing and financing arm of General Electric, it said on Monday at the Paris Air Show. 

 The order is worth $5.1 billion at list prices. GECAS' A320neo fleet will use the Leap-X engine, supplied by GE's CFM International joint venture with France's Safran. (Reporting by Matthias Blamont; Editing by  James Regan )
