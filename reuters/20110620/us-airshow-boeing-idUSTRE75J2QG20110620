 LE BOURGET, France  (Reuters) - Boeing Co said it had taken orders and commitments for 17 747-8 Intercontinental aircraft from two undisclosed carriers in deals worth a combined $5.4 billion at list prices. 

 The planemaker said one carrier committed to 15 of the passenger planes. The other carrier ordered two of the aircraft. The deals were unveiled during the Paris Air Show on Monday as Boeing and EADS unit Airbus slug it out for orders as the market for planes continues its rebound. The 747-8 is Boeing's biggest and most recognizable plane. It is set for first delivery to a customer later this year. (Reporting by Kyle Peterson; Editing by  James Regan )
