 LE BOURGET, France  (Reuters) - Raytheon Co said it has not seen any cancellations of international bookings in recent months and added that it still expects contracts to land in the second half. 

 "We've not seen anything disappear," Raytheon Chief Executive William Swanson told Reuters in an interview during the Paris Air Show on Monday. "We expect the back half to be the better part of the year" in terms of international business, he added. Among the deals Raytheon has said it expects to materialize in the second half are contracts with Taiwan and Kuwait for Patriot missiles. International revenue accounted for 25 percent of total Raytheon sales in the first quarter. (Reporting by  Karen Jacobs ; Editing by  James Regan )
