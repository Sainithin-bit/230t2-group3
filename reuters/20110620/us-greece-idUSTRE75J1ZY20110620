 ATHENS  (Reuters) - International lenders are making an unexpected visit to Athens after euro zone countries piled pressure on Greece not to backslide on painful reforms that have caused public outrage. 

 The team of European Union and International Monetary Fund (IMF) inspectors will visit as parliament holds a confidence vote on Tuesday night on Prime Minister George Papandreou's new cabinet, formed to stiffen resolve behind austerity measures to win new loans and avoid bankruptcy. Officials said the inspectors would visit on Tuesday and Wednesday. Greek government spokesman Ilias Mosialos said they would discuss changes "at a technical level" to a five-year package of spending cuts, tax hikes and public company selloffs that have touched off weeks of strikes and protests. The new plan almost doubles existing belt-tightening measures that have helped drive unemployment to a record 16 percent and extended a deep recession into its third year. Mosialos tried to dampen fears of backsliding that have unsettled international markets by saying there would be no change in the economic policy mix in the plan and only improvements in set fiscal targets would be possible. The inspectors' trip was announced after euro zone finance ministers meeting in Luxembourg on Sunday night delayed approving the next 12-billion euro ($17.07-billion) tranche of aid from Greece's year-old, first bailout, which it needs to remain solvent. The decision was clearly intended to maintain leverage on Greek lawmakers to both support the new government and push through the new five-year package, which is a condition for a second bailout worth an estimated 120 billion euros. "We are waiting for a decision from the Greek parliament. We are calling for not just the government, but the Greek opposition to support the plan," Belgian Finance Minister Didier Reynders said ahead of a second day of meetings in Luxembourg. CALL FOR ELECTIONS On Sunday, opposition leader Antonis Samaras demanded Papandreou quit to pave the way for early elections and a renegotiation of the terms of Greece's current bailout, adding to market uncertainty. Greek Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos pledged in Luxembourg to fulfil the plan, saying Greece must urgently restore its credibility. But he said before the trip he would try to gain approval from his euro zone counterparts to tweak the scheme. That raised concerns the new cabinet, facing daily protests that turned violent last Wednesday, may be looking for wiggle room on the measures -- an unpalatable prospect for euro zone taxpayers who are increasingly wary of keeping Athens afloat. "The key condition is that the Greek parliament needs to endorse the medium term (plan)... and the privatization program before the end of June," EU Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn said. Concern over contagion from the Greek crisis has hit European peripheral economies with the premium investors demand to hold Portuguese 10-year government bonds reaching a euro lifetime high on Monday. Papandreou reshuffled his government last week to quell dissent in his ruling Socialist party over the reforms. The new team is expected to survive the confidence vote but it must push on with the package to secure the next tranche and pay back debt maturing by August. The cost of insuring Greek and Italian debt against default rose after the delay of the tranche decision and a warning by credit ratings agency Moody's that it could cut the rating of Italy, which has suffered from investor fears of a Greek default. WALKING A TIGHTROPE Protesters planned a big rally on Tuesday ahead of the confidence motion and workers at Greek state utility PPC launched a 48-hour strike at midnight on Sunday, which may result in rolling power outages. They oppose government plans to sell the company. With 155 of Parliament's 300 seats, Papandreou's PASOK party is expected to support the new cabinet. Kicking off the confidence debate on Sunday, he asked Greeks to get behind the austerity package and avoid a "catastrophic" default. But his government is walking a fine line between trying to show its lenders it can meet tough fiscal targets and not fuelling public anger at the new reforms. "We will continue to listen to the messages of Greek society. We need to decisively implement government policies and the big structural reforms. We will seek systematic results by meeting economic targets," Mosialos said. "We want to give hope to the average Greek family." Greece's international lenders asked for the five-year, 28-billion-euro austerity campaign after Papandreou's government failed to meet the fiscal targets laid out in its original plan. Athens has agreed to sell state firms to raise 50 billion euros by 2015 and push through 6.5 billion euros in budget consolidation for 2011. It also aims to introduce new taxes on items ranging from real estate to restaurant bills and soft drinks to swimming pools and to cut the Mediterranean state's 750,000 strong public work force by a fifth over the next five years.
