 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - The euro zone economy is recovering and the European Central Bank should therefore gradually raise interest rates to keep inflation expectations in check, the International Monetary Fund said in a report. 

 "Given the expected path of the recovery, the normalization of interest rates should proceed gradually," the IMF said in a review of the economy of the 17 countries using the euro, released on Monday. "This will help keep inflation expectations well-anchored in the face of high headline inflation and a slowly closing output gap," the report said. "Moving cautiously will help limit stress from higher interest rates that could be felt in the periphery. At the same time, unconventional monetary measures should remain in place until financial market tensions have been addressed, including through completing the stress test follow-up and solving problems related to the funding of private illiquid assets."
