 LUXEMBOURG  (Reuters) - Euro zone finance ministers and officials met on Monday to discuss the bailout funds intended to provide help for EU members countries in financial difficulty. 

 Following are highlights of their comments ahead of the talks: BELGIAN FINANCE MINISTER DIDIER REYNDERS ON NEXT TRANCHE FOR GREECE: "The IMF agrees on the next tranche (for Greece) but we need to have a very clear program for the next years. "It is possible to see a default. We have seen three years ago such a bankruptcy in an American bank, Lehman Brothers, but we have also seen the consequences of that. So we will organize a process so as not to have a default in Greece. "It is the reason why we have organised yesterday the first discussion on private sector involvement and we will do that on a voluntary basis and then we are asking not only the government but also the opposition in Greece to take the necessary measures. And that is the most important thing maybe, like a few weeks ago in Portugal." ON SITUATION IN GREECE: "I said since the beginning, like others, to give more time, but the first responsibility is with Greece. It is only possible to give more money and more time if we have clarity about the sustainability of the Greek debt. So we will see if it is possible to receive the support not only from the government, but maybe also the opposition in Greece, like in Ireland and Portugal. It is a national necessity. ON EUROPEAN BAILOUT MECHANISM: "We will have a new program for Greece. That is for Greece. For the medium term, we need to organize something else in Europe -- the European Stability Mechanism. But if you ask me, I want to go further, I want to have Eurobonds, I want to have a real European treasury, maybe a European minister of finance as suggested by Jean-Claude Trichet. But it is not for the beginning of July, it is maybe for later." AUSTRIAN FINANCE MINISTER MARIA FEKTER ON SITUATION IN GREECE: "Time is running out. But we must await the decisions of the Greek parliament to see if Greece has fulfilled the preconditions which the troika altered. "It is about the nature of privatization, tax collection. It is also about an improvement of the administration. We have signaled to him (the Greek finance minister) that we will give time for these decisions and negotiations. He also asked for technical help ... In relation to privatization ... and he will receive it." GERMAN FINANCE MINISTER WOLFGANG SCHAEUBLE ON "SUBSTANTIAL" ROLE OF PRIVATE SECTOR: "We have to talk about that now, with all institutions involved. It's a fine line. On the one hand it has to be voluntary, because otherwise there will be consequences, but on the other hand it must also lead to a result. We will continue to work on that." "Everyone has an interest in us managing this situation well. Therefore I'm confident that we will reach a good result in this way." ON FIFTH AID TRANCHE TO GREECE: "We are not making Greece wait. Greece itself must create the conditions so that the next tranche can be paid out as agreed. That's due in July. It is Greece's responsibility that we're having difficulties now. "Greece has to make the necessary decisions. They are difficult decisions. We know that, and I said that in the Bundestag. We also have to have respect for Greece's difficulties but we cannot spare Greece these decisions. And therefore we said clearly: If Greece ... fulfils its obligations we will be able to set the conditions that the next tranche can be paid out as agreed." EU ECONOMIC AND MONETARY AFFAIRS COMMISSIONER OLLI REHN ON BAILOUT FUNDS: "I'm confident ...we'll finalize the treaty on the European Stability Mechanism, and we will decide to boost the effective lending capacity of the European Financial Stability Facility. ON GREEK AUSTERITY AND REFORM MEASURES: "I'm certain that Greece will be able to take the decisions needed, because the alternative is so much worse for Greece, default is so much worse for Greece. "Therefore it is in the interests of Greece to now work in favor of the package and thus avoid default." (Reporting by  John O'Donnell ,  Daniel Flynn ,  Annika Breidthardt )
