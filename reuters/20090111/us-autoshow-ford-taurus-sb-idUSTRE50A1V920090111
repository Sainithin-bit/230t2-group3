 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co ( F.N ) introduced a redesigned Taurus full-size sedan on Sunday in a key launch for the No. 2 U.S.-based automaker for what once was the top-selling American-made car. 

 The new 2010 Taurus, an extensive redesign tipped by Chief Executive Alan Mulally to reporters a year ago, will be built at Ford's Chicago assembly plant and available at U.S. dealers in the summer. The new Taurus is the first full redesign of the sedan since Ford opted to bring back the name in 2006 and give it to the Ford 500 sedan. The original Taurus was the top-selling U.S. car for several years during its original 20-year run that started with the 1986 model year. The redesign comes as Ford looks to boost sales of its top Sedan. Taurus sales fell 23 percent to 52,667 in 2008, far below the sales for Ford's other top cars, the compact Focus and the mid-sized Fusion. "What I like about the Taurus is that it looks outstanding for one, it is a big departure from where they were," said Erich Merkle, an industry consultant based in Grand Rapids, Michigan. "No one will even recognize it as the same vehicle." The car could address the aging of U.S. residents born during the baby boom period after World War 2, who no longer find a need for large SUVs but want to maintain comfort and efficiency and quality, Merkle said. Ford, which posted losses totaling about $8.7 billion through the first three quarters of 2008 under the downturn in the U.S. economy, has sought a government line of credit of $9 billion as insurance against a worsening in the economy. The 2010 Taurus comes with a V-6 engine and the choice of two six-speed automatic transmissions. Ford also plans to offer the car with an EcoBoost engine option, which it says can boost fuel economy up to 20 percent. The starting price remains unchanged at $25,995 from the current starting price. (Reporting by  David Bailey , editing by Peter Bohan)
