 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Hyundai Motor Co took car-of-the-year award at the Detroit auto show on Sunday, marking a major step for the South Korean automaker in its push to produce a more upscale, mass-market vehicle for U.S. consumers. 

 The Hyundai Genesis was named the 2009 North American Car of the Year, while Ford Motor Co's F-150 was named truck of the year. The awards, which automakers typically use to market their vehicles, were made by a panel of 50 U.S. and Canadian automotive journalists and presented at the start of the North American International Auto Show. "This is not only a nod to our team, but also a nod to our customers, who keep pushing us," said Mark Fields, who heads Ford's operations in the Americas. In 2008, General Motors won car-of-the-year for the Chevrolet Malibu and took both car and truck honors at the 2007 show. This year was the 16th year for the awards at the Detroit show, usually the global industry's biggest showcase event. (Reporting by  Nick Carey , editing by Peter Bohan)
