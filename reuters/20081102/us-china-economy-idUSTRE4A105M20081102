 BEIJING  (Reuters) - Finding the right balance between fighting inflation and pushing economic growth will remain a long-term challenge for China, Premier Wen Jiabao has written, warning of growing risks from the global economic downturn. 

 Wen made the warning in an essay for the ruling Communist Party's ideological journal, Seeking Truth (Qiushi), the China News Service reported, carrying a full text of the long essay. Wen wrote that the chief macro-economic policy task of his government is now "successfully maintaining the balance between the stable and relatively fast economic development and containing inflation." Even with global demand sagging, Wen said, inflation remains a long-term concern. China's combination of fast growth and low inflation in past years was exceptional and may not endure, he wrote. "To judge from international experience, it is very difficult to maintain high growth and low inflation over the long term," he wrote. "This year our country's high economic growth rate has fallen and inflationary pressures increased." He warned that "unfavorable changes" in the international economy may have an increasing impact on China, making it more difficult to balance growth and inflation at healthy levels. China's economy grew 11.9 percent in 2007, but that rate slowed to 9.9 percent in the first three-quarters of this year. Consumer price inflation, which hit a 12-year high of 8.7 percent in February, fell to 4.6 percent in September. "Against the current international financial and economic turmoil, we must must give even greater priority to maintaining our country's steady and relatively fast economic development," he wrote, while urging continued vigilance against inflation.
