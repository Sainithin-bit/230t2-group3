 DOHA  (Reuters) - Qatar is willing to help tackle the global financial crisis, Prime Minister Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim al-Thani said on Sunday after talks with British Prime Minister Gordon Brown who is seeking cash for the IMF. 

 Brown, touring Gulf States this weekend, says the IMF (International Monetary Fund) needs hundreds of billions of dollars to give it enough money to help vulnerable economies cope with the credit crisis. He wants cash-rich states such as Saudi Arabia, Qatar and China to help. "We are in agreement to work together, so that we can come up with one methodology to deal with the crisis," Sheikh Hamad told reporters after meeting Brown. "We are sharing the same world. Qatar is not excluded so we have to work together." (Reporting by  Matt Falloon , editing by Tim Pearce)
