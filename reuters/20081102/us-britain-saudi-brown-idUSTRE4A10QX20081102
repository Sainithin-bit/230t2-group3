 RIYADH  (Reuters) - Britain's Prime Minister Gordon Brown said on Sunday he expects the world's largest oil exporter Saudi Arabia to provide money for the International Monetary Fund to help get over the world financial crisis. "The Saudis, I think, will contribute so we can have a bigger fund worldwide," Brown told reporters during a stopover in the Saudi capital Riyadh, before heading to the gas-rich Gulf Arab state of Qatar. 

 Asked about whether other Gulf countries would contribute to an IMF fund: "Yes, I think people want to invest in helping the world through this very difficult period of time." British Prime Minister Gordon Brown is leading a high-level business and ministerial delegation to Gulf Arab states seeking investment, help on oil prices and funding for the IMF to help vulnerable economies through the credit crisis.
