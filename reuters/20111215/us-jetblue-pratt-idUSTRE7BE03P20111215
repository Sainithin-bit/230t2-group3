 (Reuters) - JetBlue Airways ( JBLU.O ) has signed an order for 86 Pratt & Whitney engines to power Airbus ( EAD.PA ) A320neo jetliners, the enginemaker said on Wednesday. 
 The engines, to be delivered beginning in 2018, will power 40 jetliners. The airline will also take six spares. The contract also includes a long-term maintenance agreement, Pratt, a unit of United Technologies ( UTX.N ), said. In a statement, JetBlue Chief Executive Dave Barger said the engines "will maximize performance and efficiency, while minimizing our carbon footprint." JetBlue is not disclosing the value of the PW1100G-JM PurePower engine order, spokesman Mateo Lleras said. The order is expected to be officially announced on Thursday.
