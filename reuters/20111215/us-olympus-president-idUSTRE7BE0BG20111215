 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Olympus Corp President Shuichi Takayama said on Thursday that reinstating sacked CEO Michael Woodford will be among the options in a review of the scandal-hit medical equipment and camera maker's management structure. 
 Woodford, who after his firing two months ago blew the whistle on questionable acquisition deals at the centre of the company's $1.7 billion accounting scandal, is in Japan this week as he wages a campaign to replace the company's directors.
