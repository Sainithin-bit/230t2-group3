 BUDAPEST  (Reuters) - Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban on Saturday outlined a series of investment deals between the two countries. 

 The deals, which include production, distribution and financing elements, as well as agreements about education, pave the way for long-term cooperation between the two countries, the leaders said. Below are some of the key new agreements, outlined in a release on the government's web site on Saturday. TECHNOLOGY Technology company Huawei and Hungarian Development Minister Tamas Fellegi signed a strategic agreement on Saturday to build Huawei's European Supply Center in Hungary. Huawei, which already operates logistics centres in Hungary, announced in May it would expand its distribution center in the country, where it expects employ 3,000 people and export a total of $1.2 billion worth of products this year, making it Huawei's second-largest supply center in the world. CHEMICAL PRODUCTS The Bank of China and Chinese-owned BorsodChem, a chemical company based in northern Hungary, signed a 1.1 billion euro ($1.56 billion) financing agreement. Chemicals maker Wanhua took full control of BorsodChem in February, creating the third largest isocyanate maker in the world. Isocyanates are chemicals used in the manufacturing of flexible and rigid foams, fibers, coatings, and are increasingly used in the automobile industry. Wanhua last year said it planned to bring an additional isocyanate plant online in Hungary in 2011. Anhui BBCA Biochemical Co. Ltd. also signed an agreement to build a citric acid factory in central Hungary with an annual capacity of 60,000 tons. AIRLINE/AIRPORT HNA Group, China's fourth-largest airline group and parent of Hainan Airlines Co Ltd signed a strategic cooperation agreement with the Hungarian Capital Association Ltd. HNA has been tipped by Hungarian media as one of the potential suitors for Hungary's national airline Malev. The government did not detail the nature of HNA's interest in Hungary. The countries also signed a general agreement to develop air and river transportation. Hungarian media have speculated that a Chinese airline operator may be interested in buying Malev, and added that the Chinese would also build a railway link between the airport and downtown Budapest. The release did not mention these projects. Hungary's government renationalised all but a minor stake in its loss-making flag carrier, Malev Hungarian Airlines, last year. The government has been in intense and high level negotiations with partners it would not name about the sale of the stake. RAILWAYS Development Minister Fellegi also signed an agreement on railway development and transportation. No details have been released. Fellegi said during a visit to China earlier this year that the China Railway Construction Corporation may participate in a major modernization effort of Hungary's railway network, in partnership with Hungarian state railway MAV. The minister then said there would be long term cooperation between the companies, adding that there might be financial cooperation to finance these or other projects.
