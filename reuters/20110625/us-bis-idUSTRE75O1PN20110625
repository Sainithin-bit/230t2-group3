 BASEL  (Reuters) - Swedish Central Bank governor Stefan Ingves will become chairman of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and Britain's Mervyn King will head the Global Economy Meeting (GEM), the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) announced on Saturday 

 Nout Wellink relinquishes the Basel Committee chairmanship that he has held since 2006 upon conclusion of his term as president of the Netherlands Bank at the end of June. King, Governor of the Bank of England, will take up his news post from November. The Basel Committee faces the tough task of making sure that countries implement in full its new set of tougher bank capital and liquidity rules, known as Basel III, from 2013. It has no power of sanction and Ingves will need to persuade laggard countries to toe the line on Basel III and on the new surcharges for the biggest banks, unveiled on Saturday by the Basel Committee's oversight body.
