 OTTAWA  (Reuters) - Europe may already be in a recession, or at least on the verge of entering one, Canadian Finance Minister Jim Flaherty said on Tuesday. 
 Flaherty spoke to a parliamentary committee a few hours after the Bank of Canada repeated predictions Europe would enter a short recession. "Europe is going through a very difficult time. It may well be in - or entering into - recession," Flaherty said. (Reporting by  Randall Palmer , writing by David Ljunggren; editing by Rob Wilson)
