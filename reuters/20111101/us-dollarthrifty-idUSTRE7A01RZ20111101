 (Reuters) - Dollar Thrifty Automotive Group DTG.N posted strong third-quarter results that beat estimates on higher car rental revenue, and the company forecast fourth-quarter rental revenue growth of about 1-2 percent. 
 The company, which kept its full-year fleet cost outlook of $215-$225 per vehicle, said the average gain per vehicle sold during the quarter was $1,125 per unit, compared with $632 per unit, a year ago. The company said it continues to benefit from a favorable used vehicle market and its low-cost operating structure. Dollar Thrifty posted a third-quarter net income of $66.6 million, or $2.13 a share, compared with $49.2 million, or $1.62 a share, a year ago. On an adjusted basis, it earned $2.14 a share. Revenue rose to $451.7 million from $443.5 million. Vehicle rental revenue for the quarter was up 2.4 percent. Analysts on average had expected a third-quarter profit of $1.92 a share, on revenue of $447.7 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. On Thursday, car rental firm Hertz Global Holdings Inc ( HTZ.N ) withdrew its tender offer for shares in Dollar Thrifty, but said it was still interested in buying its smaller rival if antitrust regulators clear the deal. Hertz and Avis Budget ( CAR.O ), the second- and third-biggest U.S. car rental firms behind privately-held Enterprise, had been scrapping for months over Dollar Thrifty, which is seen as the last prize in an industry that has consolidated in recent years. Tulsa, Oklahoma-based Dollar Thrifty shares, which have lost about 28 percent in the last five months, closed at $61.04 on Monday on the New York Stock Exchange.
