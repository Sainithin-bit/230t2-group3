 ATHENS  (Reuters) - A Greek ruling Socialist party lawmaker quit the parliamentary group on Tuesday, reducing Prime Minister George Papandreou's majority to 152 seats out of 300 deputies ahead of a crucial vote of confidence. 
 Milena Apostolaki quit the PASOK group because of the referendum, a parliament official said. Apostolaki said she would become an independent lawmaker but declined to say why. (Reporting by  Ingrid Melander )
