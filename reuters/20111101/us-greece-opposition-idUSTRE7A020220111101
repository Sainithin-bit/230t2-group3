 ATHENS  (Reuters) - Greece's opposition leader dismissed on Tuesday the government's call for a referendum on a new bailout deal for the debt-laden country and called for snap elections instead. 
 "Elections are a national necessity," conservative leader Antonis Samaras told reporters after meeting the President of the Republic Karolos Papoulias. Prime Minister George Papandreou's call for a referendum was putting Greece's EU membership at risk, Samaras said, adding that his New Democracy party was determined to avert any such "opportunistic experiments."
