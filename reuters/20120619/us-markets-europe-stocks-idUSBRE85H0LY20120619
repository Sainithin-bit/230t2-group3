 LONDON  (Reuters) - European equities rallied to a 1-month closing high on Tuesday after disappointing German data rekindled expectations of new monetary stimulus, which could send equities on a short-term rally. 
 German economic sentiment posted its biggest monthly drop since 1998 in June, data showed, triggering talk the U.S. Federal Reserve, which starts a two-day meeting on Tuesday, and the European Central Bank may act. "The Fed will probably act this week," Claudia Panseri, a strategist at Societe Generale, said. "Risk assets will probably be higher for a few days on the announcement." The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 added 1.6 percent to 1,009.08 points, with financial and cyclical stocks the main sectoral gainers. (Reporting By Francesco Canepa; editing by Simon Jessop)
