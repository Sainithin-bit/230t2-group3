 BAGHDAD  (Reuters) - Iraq's Cabinet approved an $843 million service contract on Tuesday with U.S. oilfield services company Weatherford (WFT.N) to build six crude production facilities in Iraq's southern Zubair oilfield, the cabinet said in a statement. 
 Italy's ENI, U.S.-based Occidental Petroleum Corp and South Korea's KOGAS signed a 20-year deal with Iraq to develop Zubair. They set an eventual output target of 1.2 million barrels per day by 2017. (Reporting by Ahmed Rasheed; editing by Keiron Henderson)
