 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. job openings dropped to a five month low in April, according to a government report on Tuesday that underscored the  recent weakness in the labor market. 
 Job openings -- a measure of labor demand -- fell 325,000 to 3.42 million, the lowest level since November the Labor Department said in its monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey. The decrease in openings in April was broad based, with manufacturing vacancies falling 62,000 to 246,000 - the lowest since November. (Reporting By  Lucia Mutikani ; Editing by  Chizu Nomiyama )
