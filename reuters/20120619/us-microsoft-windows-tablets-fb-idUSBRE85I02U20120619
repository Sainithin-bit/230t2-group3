 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp took the wraps off its "Surface" tablet on Monday, taking aim at a market dominated by Apple Inc's iPad. 
 The Surface will come in two versions, one running Windows RT, based on the same chip designs that power most tablet computers today, and a higher-performance version running Windows 8 Pro. Here's how the basic Surface measures up against the iPad: * The RT Surface boasts a thickness of 9.3 millimeters, versus the iPad's 9.4 millimeters. * It will weigh about 1.5 pounds. Apple's iPads weigh 1.44 pounds and 1.46 pounds for the WiFi and 4G LTE versions, respectively. * A 10.6-inch-diagonal screen, compared with the iPad's 9.7-inch screen. The Surface also features a unique 16:9 aspect ratio. * The RT Surface is configurable with 32 GB or 64 GB of storage. Apple's iPad has 16 GB, 32 GB and 64 GB options. * Pricing was not revealed on Monday, except that it would be "competitive" with current tablets and Intel-powered Ultrabooks. Apple's iPads go for $499 to $699 for the WiFi model, and $629 to $829 for various storage sizes of the 4G LTE model. * The RT Surface features a built-in kickstand and comes with a cover that doubles as an ultra-thin keyboard. Apple's iPad supports a plethora of third-party covers, stands and keyboards, as well as its own Smart Cover for $39 to $69. * The Surface features USB ports, 2x2 MIMO antennae and MicroSD slots, as well as display outputs.
