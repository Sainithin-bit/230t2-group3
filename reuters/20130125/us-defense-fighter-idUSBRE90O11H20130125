 OTTAWA  (Reuters) - Canada said on Friday it was reaching out to five aircraft manufacturers as part of a drawn-out and troubled bid to replace the country's aging fleet of CF-18 jets. 
 Canada announced in 2010 it would buy Lockheed-Martin Corp's ( LMT.N ) F-35, but later reversed course, amid soaring cost estimates. Ottawa has set aside C$9 billion ($8.9 billion) to buy the jets. The public works ministry, confirming earlier leaks from senior government officials, said in a statement on Friday that Ottawa would talk to Lockheed Martin and four other firms: * Boeing Co ( BA.N ), which makes the F-18 Super Hornet * EADS ( EAD.PA ), which makes the Eurofighter * Saab AB SAAB.b.ST, which makes the Gripen * Dassault Aviation ( AVMD.PA ), which makes the Rafale (Reporting by  David Ljunggren )
