 BOLOGNA, Italy  (Reuters) - Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti described as a "remote hypothesis" the possibility of Monte Paschi bank being nationalized, when asked to comment on a television talk show on Friday. 
 Monti was talking to the La7 network as questions grew about central bank oversight of the historic lender following the uncovering of nearly $1 billion of losses in complex derivatives deals. (Reporting by  Stephen Jewkes ; Editing by  Robin Pomeroy )
