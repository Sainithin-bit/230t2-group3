 PARIS  (Reuters) - Asset manager BlackRock ( BLK.N ) has a stake of just over 5 percent of French bank Societe Generale ( SOGN.PA ), French market regulator AMF said on Friday. 
 The disclosure was made after BlackRock's holding - acquired on and off the market - rose above the 5 percent threshold at which such disclosures are mandatory. On behalf of clients and funds under management, BlackRock now has a 5.002 percent stake in SocGen and 4.48 percent of voting rights in the group, according to the AMF filing. A BlackRock spokesman in London said the asset manager did not comment on individual company holdings. (Reporting by  Christian Plumb  and Benjamin Mallet. Editing by Jane Merriman)
