 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Democratic leaders in Congress and the White House will meet again on Saturday to negotiate a rescue plan to help U.S. automakers, a congressional source told Reuters on Friday. 

 General Motors, Ford Motor, and Chrysler have asked Congress for a combined $34 billion. "We will meet tomorrow and go from there," the source said, speaking on condition of anonymity. The White House and Democratic leaders had been locked in a stalemate until U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat, dropped her opposition to using an existing $25 billion advanced technology fund to help Detroit.
