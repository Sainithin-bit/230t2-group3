 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The White House said on Saturday that the federal government should not give money to help Detroit's Big Three automakers unless there was a strong likelihood it could be paid back. 

 "Taxpayers should not be asked to finance assistance for automakers without a strong likelihood that they will be paid back," White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said in a statement. She said the money should come from funds already appropriated for automakers through an Energy Department program to improve fuel efficiency and should be accompanied by "very strong taxpayer protections." Perino said the White House has had "constructive discussions" with Democratic and Republican members of the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate on a bailout plan and "hope to continue to make progress."
