 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The White House is discussing with Democratic congressional leaders a possible bailout to rescue U.S. automakers, a congressional source told Reuters on Friday. 

 "Dodd, Barney Frank and the White House are all talking. They are all talking to each other," the congressional aide said, referring to Sen. Christopher Dodd, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, and Frank, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee. The aide, speaking on condition of anonymity, said it was uncertain if a bill would first go to the House or the Senate. General Motors, Ford Motor, and Chrysler have asked Congress for a combined $34 billion.
