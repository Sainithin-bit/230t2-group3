 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Nagging concerns about banks and a new round of fears about a global recession dragged down equity markets worldwide on Monday and sparked risk aversion, lifting the dollar and driving up interbank dollar borrowing costs. 

 Oil jumped more than 3 percent to $47 a barrel as a naval incident between the United States and China, the world's top oil consumers, boosted geopolitical tensions and as dealers pondered the possibility of deeper production cuts by OPEC. U.S. Treasury debt prices were flat to modestly lower as this week's $182 billion sale of government securities reined in safety bids tied to persistent worries about the economy and the financial sector. MSCI's all-country world index .MIWD00000PUS fell to its lowest point since March 2003, and is a few points away from breaking through to lows last seen in 1995. U.S. stocks slid in volatile trade and the Nasdaq set a six-and-a-half-year low as shares of big pharmaceutical companies fell after Merck's ( MRK.N ) proposed $41 billion takeover of Schering-Plough SGP.N. Large deals are traditionally deemed a show of support for equity valuations but analysts said with the Dow and S&P 500 at 12-year lows, evidence of thawing credit markets and economic recovery is needed to renew investors' interest in stocks. "We are seeing confidence in general melt away and the mark-to-market capital position of financial institutions deteriorate rapidly," said Robert Tipp, chief investment strategist with Prudential Investment Management's public fixed-income group in Newark, New Jersey. U.S. banking shares rose on optimism that Washington will provide more clarity on government plans to shore up the U.S. banking system. President Barack Obama met with Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, and the White House said Obama is pleased with coordination between the administration and the Fed. But banking shares took the most points off the leading index of top European shares as investors fed the financial sector following news of further government stake-building, fanning worries about the stability of Britain's banks. With the outlook so dim, Barclays cut its year-end target for the S&P 500 to 760 points, saying the probability of the benchmark U.S. stock index hitting its prior target of 875 is much lower now. Growing fears about the ailing U.S. automakers and banking drove interbank U.S. dollar borrowing costs up. "We're in a holding pattern and this is a market that doesn't like to wait for anything so (there is) probably still a little bit of bias to the downside," said Jeffrey Kleintop, chief market strategist at LPL Financial in Boston. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  closed down 79.89 points, or 1.21 percent, at 6,547.05. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  fell 6.85 points, or 1.00 percent, at 676.53. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  shed 25.21 points, or 1.95 percent, at 1,268.64. The FTSEurofirst 300  .FTEU3  index of top European shares closed down 0.7 percent at 657.30 points, while in Asia Japan's Nikkei average  .N225  closed at a 26-year low, off 1.2 percent. Other Asian markets slipped on worries about the fate of General Motors ( GM.N ) and U.S. banks. The dollar gained, reflecting its tracking of equity market performance over the last few weeks. The dollar has tended to benefit when stocks fall as investors seek shelter amid fears of a collapse of banking systems worldwide. The dollar rose against a basket of major currencies, with the U.S. Dollar Index .DXY up 0.68 percent at 89.151. Against the yen, the dollar rose 0.36 percent at 98.72. The euro fell 0.28 percent at $1.2604. "We're certainly in risk aversion mode and the trade right now is to buy dollars, which to a large extent reflects huge repatriation flows to the United States," said Robert Blake, senior currency strategist at State Street in Boston. The yen fell after Japan swung to its first current account deficit in 13 years and as the deepening downturn in Japan has taken the shine off the yen's attraction as a safe-haven currency in recent weeks. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note was break-even, yielding 2.87 percent. The 2-year U.S. Treasury note fell 2/32 in price to yield 0.97 percent. The U.S. State Department said five Chinese ships, including a naval vessel, harassed an unarmed U.S. Navy ocean surveillance ship in international waters in the South China Sea on Sunday. "Crude prices are up, I think, in a knee-jerk reaction to the news of Chinese vessels harassing a U.S. Navy ship in the South China Sea," said Phil Flynn, analyst at Alaron Trading in Chicago. U.S. crude settled up $1.55 at $47.07 a barrel, while London Brent crude fell 72 cents to settle at $44.13 a barrel. U.S. gold futures ended more than 2 percent lower, erasing last session's solid gains, as a dollar rise and a slight drop in the holdings of gold-backed exchange traded funds triggered heavy sell-stop orders. Gold for April delivery settled down $24.70 at $918.00 an ounce in New York. barrel.
