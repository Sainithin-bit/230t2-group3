 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Merck & Co Inc said on Monday that it would acquire Schering-Plough Corp for $41.1 billion, or $23.61 per share, uniting the makers of cholesterol drugs Zetia and Vytorin. 

 The two New Jersey-based drugmakers, which announced significant job cuts last fall, have been striving to become more efficient amid setbacks to Vytorin and Zetia, whose combined fourth-quarter sales slumped 26 percent. COMMENTS PETER KENNY, MANAGING DIRECTOR AT KNIGHT EQUITY MARKETS IN JERSEY CITY, NEW JERSEY "In any other market this would be really bullish news, the fact that you're seeing a muted responses- none at all, really- speaks to the overall weight that this market feels because of the decelerating macroeconomic environment. This is a cost-saving move for both companies. It makes sense as a combination for future growth, but the futures aren't paying attention. "I wouldn't say this is a merger out of weakness. Its a merger that makes a lot of sense because of the economies of scale. The companies have production facilities close to each other, and the fact that they're taking advantage of economies of scale makes a lot of sense. It's good business." NAVID MALIK, ANALYST AT MATRIX CORPORATE CAPITAL, LONDON "Fred Hassan is a dealmaker and he's done it again, and I think this probably makes a lot of sense. You can cut your costs to a certain extent as individual companies but there comes a point when you can't pare your sales force or R&D spend any more ... and you then need to look at bringing two companies together and cutting duplicated costs, which is a hell of a lot easier. When you are co-promoting drugs like Vytorin, the easy thing to do is to slash the number of salesmen that are co-promoting them." DAVID MOSKOWITZ, ANALYST AT CARIS & CO "I think it should be at least $12 billion to $15 billion higher, I don't think investors will be happy until the price comes up to the high-$20's or $30 (per share)." "There will be sparks today." "But the deal makes sense on other levels. They'll get Schering's allergy products, which can be sold alongside Merck's Singulair asthma drug, and they'll now own Vytorin and Zetia outright" "Vytorin and Zetia together are $4.5 billion in annual sales and it looks like the drugs are stabilizing" (after sales declines). That's a lot of cash flow, even if the drugs are not growing, which will fund R&D and the deal." ANDREW WEISS, ANALYST AT SWISS BANK VONTOBEL "Mainly, it's probably about cost synergies from integrating that (Vytorin) franchise." On whether other companies will join the M&A wave: "Roche and Novartis are already engaged in large acquisitions -- they're not out to do another big deal. The question is more: is Astra(Zeneca) on the plate? What is Sanofi going to do? And what is Glaxo going to do?" JEFFREY HOLFORD, ANALYST AT JEFERRIES IN LONDON "It seems somewhat inevitable. The industry needs to shrink because there is just not the same market for branded pharmaceuticals going forward as there has been over the last 10 years. There is over-capacity and they (Merck and Schering-Plough) need to take each others capacity out of the market."
