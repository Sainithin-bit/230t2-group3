 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Two arthritis drugs could cause aches and pains for Merck & Co as it pursues its $41 billion purchase of smaller drugmaker Schering-Plough Corp, but are unlikely to derail the deal, analysts said. 

 The question is whether Merck will be allowed to inherit Schering-Plough's overseas rights to Remicade, a $2 billion-a-year treatment for rheumatoid arthritis, and overseas rights to a potentially lucrative newer arthritis treatment called golimumab. Schering-Plough years ago acquired the rights to Remicade and golimumab from diversified healthcare company Johnson & Johnson, which sells Remicade in the United States. Golimumab is awaiting approval in Europe. In a conference call after the deal was announced, analysts clammored to know whether so-called change-of-control provisions in Schering-Plough's long-standing licensing deal with J&J would prevent Merck from taking over overseas rights. "We believe that the Schering-Plough rights to Remicade and golimumab are not affected by the merger," Merck Chief Financial Officer Peter Kellogg said, without seeming to allay concerns of many analysts. Merck said the change-of-control provision will not be triggered because the deal is being structured as a reverse merger, in which smaller Schering-Plough is technically acquiring Merck, and assuming the Merck name. Kellogg said no change of control will take place because Schering-Plough -- not Merck -- will create a new board for the new entity, comprised of Merck's existing board and three members of the existing Schering-Plough board. Merck said it had not discussed the Schering-Plough merger with J&J, but Kellogg said the matter would be decided by binding arbitration were J&J to raise an objection. Merck would then "vigorously defend" its position, he said. Sanford Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson predicted no major impediments to the Merck acquisition, although he said J&J theoretically could make its own bid for Schering-Plough "because the fit between Schering-Plough and J&J would be a good one." "Obviously Merck is using sophistry to make it look like it is not the acquirer, when the economic terms of this deal suggest otherwise," said Peter Jankovskis, director of research at OakBrook Investments in Lisle, Illinois. Even so, Jankovskis predicted the potentially acrimonious arthritis-drugs issue will not deter Merck from closing the deal. "It will likely go forward and Merck is willing to let whatever happens happen because there are probably enough other good aspects of the transaction," he said.
