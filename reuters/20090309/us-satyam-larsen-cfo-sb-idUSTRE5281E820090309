 MUMBAI  (Reuters) - Indian engineering and construction firm Larsen & Toubro Ltd ( LART.BO ) will submit an expression of interest for fraud-tainted Satyam Computer Services Ltd SATY.BO, but will decide on a bid later, a top official said on Monday. 

 "We will participate in the expression of interest definitely and depending on the due diligence process we will take a call on the bid," Chief Financial officer Y.M. Deosthalee said on television channel NDTV Profit. A L&T spokesman had earlier said the company expected to go ahead with a bid for Satyam after the outsourcer said it was commencing a competitive bidding process to sell a 51 percent stake.
