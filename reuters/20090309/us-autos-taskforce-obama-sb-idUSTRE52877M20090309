 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. officials who visited Detroit on Monday to meet with senior managers at General Motors ( GM.N ) and Chrysler CBS.UL stressed that President Barack Obama understands the urgency of the companies' situation, an official said. 

 But a U.S. official said the Obama administration's auto task force also told the companies that a "fundamental restructuring" will be needed for the industry. "The auto team continues to consult with all constituencies around the clock on this issue, both recognizing the urgency and being deliberate in this process," the official said.
