 LONDON  (Reuters) - Lloyds Banking Group ( LLOY.L ) said Britain's requirement for banks to hold enough capital to withstand a "severe" downturn was key to its decision to insure 260 billion pounds ($370 billion) of risky assets with the UK government. 

 The deal, announced on Saturday, will limit losses if the economy continues to deteriorate, but it will give Britain a stake of up to 77 percent in Lloyds and sent Lloyds shares skidding over 10 percent on Monday as it will further dilute investors. The bank's comments about capital raised alarm the regulator is imposing more stringent requirements and was seen as negative for Barclays ( BARC.L ), which is considering putting assets into the UK asset protection scheme. "Whereas before the posture was that capital ratios could drift down toward the regulatory minimums as conditions worsened, the thinking now is that capital should be looked at in the face of a reasonably severe stress," said Lloyds Chief Executive Eric Daniels. "That's one of the impetuses behind looking at the appropriate amount of capitalization that's necessary and how much should be thrown into the scheme," he told analysts on a conference call. The Financial Services Authority said on January 19 that a previous UK recapitalization plan was designed to give banks a decent capital buffer, which was expected to be run down as banks absorbed expected losses. It declined to comment on Monday. Lloyds has started meeting investors to discuss the plan, which shows policymakers are giving unprecedented support to try to get lending flowing again and restore confidence in the battered banking sector. By 1250 GMT (8:50 a.m. EDT) Lloyds shares were down 8.1 percent at 38.6 pence, after an early low of 36p. Analysts welcomed the news of the risk protection but said it is more dilutive than expected and relatively expensive. Shares in Barclays, whose talks with the Treasury will intensify this week about whether it will put assets into the protection scheme, fell 11 percent, the biggest FTSE 100 faller. "The guaranteed asset protection scheme looks to be very thorough, in terms of virtually eliminating the risk of full nationalization... but also in terms of diluting the existing shareholders," said Bruno Paulson, analyst at Bernstein. The deal renewed criticism of Lloyds' takeover of HBOS, which made a loss of almost 11 billion pounds last year and accounted for 83 percent of the assets going into the plan. Some investors are calling for Chairman Victor Blank and Daniels to go. "The (HBOS) deal shouldn't have happened and when it did happen shareholders had to vote for both things (the takeover and a capital injection) for Lloyds to get the initial capital injection. And now they are stuffed," said a top 10 investor, who asked not to be named. He said Britain taking a majority stake in Lloyds had appeared inevitable as HBOS's problems became clearer. RISK REDUCTION The terms for Lloyds appear more onerous than those for Royal Bank of Scotland ( RBS.L ), which was the first UK bank to enter the scheme by insuring 325 billion pounds of assets. Lloyds will be responsible for the first 25 billion pounds of any losses, compared to 19.5 billion pounds for RBS, with the state bearing 90 percent of any subsequent losses. Daniels said the terms represented "cost effective insurance" and Lloyds has got comparable or slightly better terms than RBS as he is ridding the bank of more risky assets -- the scheme will relieve Lloyds of 194 billion pounds of risk-weighted assets compared to 144 billion for RBS. The deal will lift Lloyds' core tier 1 capital ratio to 14.5 percent from 6.4 percent. "The risk reduction is fairly extensive and makes it tough to see Lloyds requiring any further government help," Bernstein's Paulson said in a note. The government's stake in Lloyds will rise to 65 percent from 43 percent if shareholders do not take up an offer to buy 4 billion pounds of shares currently held by the government. Britain's holding could rise to 77 percent if the 'B' shares are converted to ordinary shares. A spokesman for Prime Minister Gordon Brown said the government stood by its decision to back the takeover of HBOS by Lloyds, which he said was initiated by Lloyds. "While the government is standing behind the chairman and CEO, their credibility is very low in the eyes of institutional shareholders because they did an incredibly poor transaction," said a second investor, who asked not to be named. Daniels told Reuters on Saturday there had been no sign from investors they would object to the plan.
