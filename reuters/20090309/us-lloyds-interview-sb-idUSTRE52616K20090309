 LONDON  (Reuters) - Lloyds Banking Group ( LLOY.L ) chief executive Eric Daniels said a deal which will see the British state owning most of the bank in return for insuring its riskiest assets is good for investors as it will provide protection against a weakening economy. 

 "We got the right deal for Lloyds shareholders," Daniels told Reuters in an interview. "I think that with the (asset protection) scheme we are tremendously well-capitalized in an uncertain environment, and that's not a bad place to be." Daniels said he would meet with shareholders on Monday to discuss the agreement, but that he had received "no indication that there is general unhappiness." "We think we know what they're interested in and we will certainly be addressing those issues," he said. The Lloyds board has unanimously backed the agreement, reached early on Saturday after two weeks of negotiations with the government, the bank said. Under the deal, Lloyds will get protection against losses on some 260 billion pounds ($369.8 billion) of risky credit-related assets by placing them in a government-backed insurance scheme. But the government's stake in the bank could rise to 77 percent from 43 percent as a result of share transactions designed to meet the costs of Lloyd's participation in the scheme. Daniels also defended Lloyds TBS's acquisition of HBOS in January. The takeover has been criticized for exposing conservatively-run Lloyds TSB to billions of pounds of risky loans made by HBOS. "The HBOS deal will prove to be a very good deal, and we will basically reward our shareholders over several years with a very good leading position," he said. "I think we've got a good future ahead. I fully expect I will be a part of it going forward." (Reporting by  Myles Neligan , editing by Mike Peacock)
