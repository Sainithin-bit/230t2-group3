 ZURICH  (Reuters) - Swiss bank Credit Suisse ( CSGN.VX ) and reinsurer Swiss Re RUKN.VX both announced new chairmen on Monday, shifting executives in an effort to limit the impact of the financial crisis. 

 Walter Kielholz will step down as chairman at bank Credit Suisse to focus on the same role at reinsurer Swiss Re, where he would replace Peter Forstmoser. Forstmoser will resign from the board on May 1, Swiss Re said in a statement. Hans-Ulrich Doerig, who was previously vice chairman at Credit Suisse, would become chairman at the Swiss bank. Following are a selection of reactions to the appointments: ON IMPACT ON SWISS RE: STEFAN SCHUERMANN, ANALYST AT VONTOBEL "The resignation of the chairman could be expected and we see Walter Kielholz's role not to extend over its end 2009/spring 2010 term. We therefore see his task as temporary, trying to normalize the situation at Swiss Re." "Whereas the re-shuffling of the Supervisory Board is a step in the right direction, the leaving of three board members with no replacement at 13 March AGM -- no new external people at all -- confirms how delicate Swiss Re's current situation is. We reiterate our Hold recommendation and 20 Swiss francs per share price target." TIM DAWSON, ANALYST AT HELVEA "This is not a clean break for Swiss Re. "Kielholz was the person who started the move into alternative risk products. "The company needs to make some major changes to restore investor confidence. I am not sure whether this goes far enough." RENE LOCHER, ANALYST AT SAL OPPENHEIM "It's a clear sign that Swiss Re is going back to the old, traditional reinsurance business. Kielholz was CEO of Swiss Re from 1997 to 2002. The focus then was on reinsurance and Swiss Re generated a large chunk of its net profit out of the reinsurance business. "A lot of people are blaming Swiss Re, saying that they should have sacked Kielholz as he was part of the drive into the investment banking strategy. "But the key message is that Swiss Re is trying to keep reinsurance know-how on the board and this is good news." ZUERCHER KANTONALBANK ANALYSTS "Because of the 'double mandate' he had until now, a focusing of Walter Kielholz's strength appears to make sense. But until now he was considered a strong man on the Swiss Re board and therefore as one of those mainly responsible for the current problems at Swiss Re." FABRIZIO CROCE, INSURANCE ANALYST AT KEPLER CAPITAL MARKETS "This is bad news. The financial market, the press and academic circles repeatedly asked (Swiss Re) vice-chairman Kielholz to resign as one of the people responsible for the current situation and not only chairman Forstmoser. "In our view, chairman Forstmoser was not the strongest person on Swiss Re's board and may therefore be a scapegoat. The fact that full responsibility now goes to Peter Forstmoser by even promoting vice-chairman Kielholz to chairman seems strange to us." ON IMPACT ON CREDIT SUISSE: TERESA NIELSEN, ANALYST AT VONTOBEL "It is a great benefit that the new Chairman, Hans-Ulrich Doerig, has a great detailed knowledge about Credit Suisse, having worked together with the CEO, Brady Dougan, for 20 years. He has been heading the Risk Committee which we believe will be a great benefit in the current environment. We believe the change of the chairman will happen smoothly and are highly positive on the choice of Hans-Ulrich Doerig to lead on Credit Suisse." DIRK BECKER, BANKING ANALYST AT KEPLER CAPITAL MARKETS "Credit Suisse found someone who is very capable of doing the job with more than 30 years of experience to replace Kielholz."
