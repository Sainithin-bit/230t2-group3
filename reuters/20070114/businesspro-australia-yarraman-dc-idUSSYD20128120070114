 MELBOURNE  (Reuters) - U.S.-based Yarraman Winery Inc. 
YRMN.PK said it remains committed to a takeover deal for 
Australian wine maker Evans & Tate Ltd ETW.AX, which rejected 
its offer on Friday. 

  "Yarraman advises that negotiations with the board of Evans 
& Tate, regarding a merger between the companies, are ongoing 
and Yarraman remains committed to the deal," the company said.  Evans & Tate said on Friday it would not be accepting the 
offer in its current form.  Yarraman last month made a conditional takeover offer for 
the firm after securing a 19.9 percent stake from its former 
executive chairman.  Yarraman said director Bill Middleton would remain in Perth 
to continue discussions.  "We will be sitting down with the Evans & Tate board to 
discuss any concerns with the offer and are confident of 
resolving any issues," Yarraman said.  Evans & Tate closed flat at 17.5 Australian cents on 
Friday, giving it a market capitalization on A$16.1 million. 
The stock was trading at more than A$1.50 five years ago.  Yarraman had offered one of its shares for every nine Evans 
& Tate shares. Yarraman says the offer values the company at 
A$131 million ($102 million), including preference shares, 
convertible notes and A$90 million in debt.  ($1=A$1.28)
