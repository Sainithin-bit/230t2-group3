 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - DaimlerChrysler's DCXGn.DE 
fourth-quarter and full-year 2006 results may not be released 
as planned on February 14 and the April 4 annual general 
meeting may also be postponed, a German newspaper reported on 
Sunday. 

  "The risk is considerable that we will not be able to stick 
with the timetable," the Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung 
quoted a DaimlerChrysler spokeswoman as saying.  The reason for the possible delay is that the carmaker's 
accountants have refused, unlike in earlier years, to work 
weekends in January to complete the results, the newspaper 
said.  "This is putting us under extreme pressure," the 
spokeswoman said.  The overtime ban imposed by the DaimlerChrysler works 
council is in protest against management's plans to cut 6,000 
administrative jobs and to move some administrative functions 
to Prague, where labor costs are lower than in Germany.
