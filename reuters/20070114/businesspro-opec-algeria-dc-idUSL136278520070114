 ALGIERS  (Reuters) - OPEC members are consulting one another 
on whether to hold an emergency meeting to discuss a 15 percent 
price drop since the start of the year, Algerian Energy and 
Mines Minister Chakib Khelil said on Saturday. 

  "There are consultations, but no consensus for the moment 
(on whether to hold one)," he said in brief remarks to 
reporters.  Asked whether OPEC was planning to cut output again, he 
replied: "We have already decided to cut production by 500,000 
barrels per day (bpd) from February. If there is another 
decision to cut output, I would completely support the 
consensus decision."  On Friday, the Dow Jones news service quoted a senior OPEC 
delegate as saying the producer group was discussing whether to 
hold an emergency meeting around January 20-21.  OPEC President Mohammed al-Hamli, also UAE oil minister, 
said on Thursday OPEC was deeply concerned by the price drop 
and stood ready if necessary to bolster the world market.  Mild weather so far this winter has curbed oil demand and 
pressured prices, blunting the impact of OPEC's planned 500,000 
barrels per day cut in supply from February 1 that added to a 
1.2 million bpd reduction last year.
