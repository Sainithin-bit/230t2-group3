 LONDON  (Reuters) - London Stock Exchange ( LSE.L ) is in 
talks about its future with its second-largest shareholder, 
U.S. investor Samuel Heyman, the Observer newspaper reported on 
Sunday. 

  An LSE spokesman had confirmed for the first time that the 
LSE was in "ongoing discussions" with Heyman, who owns 10.07 
percent of the shares, the report said.  It also mentioned speculation Heyman was trying to broker a 
deal that would see the LSE sold to its U.S. rival Nasdaq 
( NDAQ.O ), which holds a stake of more that 28 percent and has 
launched a 2.7 billion-pounds ($5.2 billion) hostile bid for 
the LSE in December.  Neither party was immediately available to comment.
