 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Kimberly-Clark Corp. ( KMB.N ), the 
maker of Kleenex tissues and Huggies diapers, may be the target 
of a leveraged buyout, Barron's reported in its January 15 
edition, citing a credit analyst. 

  An upswell in call options activity and a weak performance 
by the company's bonds reflects speculation about a buyout, the 
business news weekly said, citing Craig Hutson of the bond 
research firm Gimme Credit.  The company has a long record of sizable and stable cash 
flow, it has a global presence, and a restructuring effort is 
in the early stages, Hutson said. A 20-percent premium to the 
company's recent stock price would value Kimberly at $41 
billion, Barron's said.  The credit analysis does not suggest an offer is imminent, 
but implies the company's shares are relatively cheap if 
management can cut costs and boost profit margins, Barron's 
said.  Kimberly shares, which reached a 52-week high last week, 
closed Friday at $69.02 on the New York Stock Exchange.
