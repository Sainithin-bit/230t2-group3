 CEBU, Philippines  (Reuters) - China's Premier Wen Jiabao told Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe that he would like to visit Japan in early or mid-April, a Japanese government official said on Sunday. 

 The official said Abe welcomed Wen's comment, made during a regional summit in the central Philippines. The trip would mark a further warming of relations between the two countries after years of hostility under former Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi.
