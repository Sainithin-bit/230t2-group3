 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - New orders at U.S. factories jumped by a bigger-than-expected 1.3 percent in July, helped by a rise in transportation orders, a Commerce Department report showed on Wednesday. 

 Economists polled by Reuters were expecting factory orders to gain 1 percent in the month. June's increase was revised up to a 2.1 percent gain from 1.7 percent. Factory orders have risen for five months in a row. Transportation orders jumped 3.2 percent in July after a 1.8 percent drop a month earlier. When transportation orders were stripped out, factory orders still rose 1 percent, reflecting gains in orders for metals, machinery, and nondurable goods. Durable goods orders rose 1.3 percent, as expected. June's rise in durables orders was revised up to 1.4 percent. Inventories rose for the 10th time in the last 11 months, but the inventory-to-shipments ratio dipped to 1.20 months supply from 1.22 percent, the lowest since July 2007, the Commerce Department said.
