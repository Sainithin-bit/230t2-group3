 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Navistar International Corp ( NAV.N ), the U.S. truck- and engine-maker, reported stronger-than-expected earnings on Wednesday, partly due to strong orders for its military products. 

 The company also raised it full-year guidance, saying high diesel prices were lifting demand for its more fuel efficient heavy trucks. Navistar said it earned $272 million, or $3.68 a share, in the fiscal third-quarter ended July 31, compared with a loss of $17 million, or 24 cents a share, during the comparable quarter last year. Analysts, on average, expected the Warrenville, Illinois-based company to report a profit of $1.42, according to Reuters Estimates. The company also raised its full-year guidance, saying it expects to report full-year earnings in a range of $6.35 to $7.45 a share -- well above analysts expectations of $4.74 a share. "Although we continue to face a weak truck market in North America and anticipate our results to moderate in the fourth quarter, we are revising our full-year guidance upward," Dan Ustian, the company's chairman, president and chief executive, said in a statement. The company, which supplies diesel engines to Ford Motor Co ( F.N ), said quarterly worldwide engine shipments fell 27 percent as sales of the automaker's heavy-duty F-150 pickups slumped. It said shipments to other manufacturers and Navistar's own truck group increased 26 percent during the quarter. (Reporting by  James Kelleher ; Editing by Phil Berlowitz)
