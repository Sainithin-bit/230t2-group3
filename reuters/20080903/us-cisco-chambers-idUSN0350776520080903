 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Cisco Systems Inc ( CSCO.O ) is seeing mixed views from its customers around the world, Chief Executive John Chambers said in response to a question about global technology demand in an interview with CNBC. 

 Chambers said on Wednesday that network equipment maker Cisco's customers were still expecting an economic recovery in the first half of 2009. While he said there were still challenges in the U.S. market Chambers said demand in emerging markets, the Asia Pacific region and in Europe appeared to be holding up well. He said that while improvements in demand from the U.S. financial services sector in the last quarter and a half were a good sign it was too soon to say if this would last. (Editing by Dave Zimmerman)
