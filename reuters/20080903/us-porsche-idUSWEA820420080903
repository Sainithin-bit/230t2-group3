 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Porsche sales in North America nearly halved to 1,516 vehicles last month as demand for its core 911 sports coupe plummeted ahead of the model's upcoming facelift, the company said on Thursday. 

 "The 45 percent drop compared to the previous year is in line with Porsche expectations and can be explained by the upcoming launch of the new 911 Carrera and Targa models," it said in a statement. The refreshened base version with direct fuel injection and double-clutch transmission hits showrooms in the United States and Canada on September 20, while the more expensive four-wheel drive version of the Carrera as well as the Targa debut on October 25. Total 911 sales in North America fell 58 percent in August, while Cayenne sales fell 9 percent. Combined Boxster and Cayman sales fell by 66 percent in the month. (Reporting by  Christiaan Hetzner )
