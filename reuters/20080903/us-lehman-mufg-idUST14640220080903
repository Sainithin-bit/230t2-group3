 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) ( 8306.T ) has no plans to invest in U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers LEH.N, an executive at Japan's largest bank said, responding to a media report that it was considering taking a stake. 

 The Times of London reported that the core banking unit of MUFG was poised to enter the bidding for a substantial stake in Lehman. The report sent shares of Lehman higher in after-hours trade.   MUFG has "absolutely no plans" to invest in Lehman, an executive involved in major decisions at the bank told Reuters. (Reporting by Taro Fuse)
