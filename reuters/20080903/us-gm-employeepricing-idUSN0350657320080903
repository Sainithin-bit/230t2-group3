 DETROIT  (Reuters) - General Motors Corp ( GM.N ) has extended its employee-level pricing discount program by one month through September and added a number of 2009 model year vehicles to the offer, a spokesman said on Wednesday. 

 GM, the No. 1 U.S. automaker, in August launched the program to boost sagging sales and clear out inventory. The program includes nearly all 2008 model year vehicles and has been expanded to include most 2009 model year vehicles at dealerships, GM spokesman John McDonald said.
