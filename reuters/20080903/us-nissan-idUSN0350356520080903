 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co said on Wednesday its U.S. sales rose 13.6 percent in August to 108,493 vehicles, as easing gasoline prices increased demand for large trucks and SUVs. 

 Nissan-brand sales were up 14.2 percent to 97,417 vehicles in August, driven by a 32.6 percent jump in light truck sales, Al Castignetti, vice president and general manager of the Nissan division, told Reuters. Sales of its luxury Infiniti brand increased 8 percent to 11,076 units for the month. The August 2008 month had 27 selling days, same as a year earlier. (Reporting by  Soyoung Kim )
