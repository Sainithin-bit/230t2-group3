 (Reuters) - Hedge fund manager Ospraie Management LLC is closing its flagship fund after it plunged 27 percent in August on losses in energy, mining and natural resources equity holdings, in one of the biggest ever closures of a commodities-focused hedge fund.  

 Volatile energy and commodities markets have bankrupt several hedge funds and trading companies and racked up big losses for others during a six-year rally sparked by rising emerging economy demand. Oil prices have tumbled nearly 30 percent from their peak in July and other commodities have been dragged down as well by slowing consumption in the United States and other developed economies. Here is a list of some of funds and companies sunk or taking big losses in energy and commodities markets: July 2008 - U.S. energy trader SemGroup LP collapsed after making $3.2 billion in bad bets on oil prices. February 2008 - MF Global loses $142 million from unauthorized trading by an employee in the Chicago wheat market. September 2007 - London-based Global Advisors LP, a commodity hedge fund manager, announced it would close two funds due to poor performance. November 2007 - Hedge fund Red Kite Metals suffers double digits losses on slumping metal prices after getting hit with heavy losses in January. The fund defied expectations it would collapse and saw strong gains in early 2008. September 2006 - Hedge fund Amaranth Advisors LLC and former head trader Brian Hunter racked up $6.4 billion in losses from U.S. natural gas futures contracts before the fund folded in 2006. August 2006 - Energy hedge fund MotherRock collapses due to losses in the U.S. natural gas futures markets. (Editing by Peter Blackburn)
