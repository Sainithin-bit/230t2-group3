 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Staples Inc ( SPLS.O ), the world's largest office products retailer, posted a 16 percent fall in quarterly profit on Wednesday, but said sales appeared to be stabilizing in a weak U.S. economy, sending its shares higher. 

 The company said it was early to predict a recovery for the U.S. economy, which has prompted its small-business customers to buy less furniture and office supplies. But its chief executive signaled a positive note on a call with analysts. "I don't think it's down from here," CEO Ron Sargent said. "I think if anything it's up from here because I think the economy is up from here. But it's a little early to be saying we've got a trend going here." Staples' shares rose 3.5 percent in early trading. The company said earnings declined to $150.2 million, or 21 cents a share, in the fiscal second quarter that ended August 2, from $178.8 million, or 25 cents a share, a year earlier. The results were in line with Wall Street expectations after the company cut its full-year forecast last month. Quarterly sales rose 18 percent to $5.07 billion, helped by the acquisition of Dutch peer Corporate Express. Sales at North American retail stores fell 1 percent, while sales at stores open at least a year fell 7 percent in both North America and Europe as stores experienced less traffic. Weak sales of furniture, desktop computers, printers and digital cameras were somewhat offset by strength in laptops, ink and technology services. Sales of office supplies have suffered as small-business customers contend with higher commodity costs, a decline in housing values and difficulty securing credit. Despite the challenging market, Staples "continues to outpace its peer group," said Edward Jones senior retail analyst Stephanie Hoff. "In the U.S., the retail business has seen sales decline, and that business isn't growing too rapidly. But they are doing better than their peers," Hoff said. DELIVERIES UP North American delivery services grew 25 percent to $2.0 billion in the quarter, including Corporate Express, as existing customers continued to buy supplies but scaled back on larger purchases such as furniture. Growth is slowing but sales have not come to a standstill, Joseph Doody, president of Staples' North American delivery business, said on a call with analysts. "Certainly, we're growing faster than the office superstore competitors, but we're also not losing share to discounters or clubs, either. So I think it's a very tough time to be in the office products business but despite that ... we're kind of standing tall," Doody said. For its pre-acquisition business, Staples reiterated that it expects full-year sales growth in the low single digits, and earnings flat with last year's adjusted profit of $1.42 per share. Staples' shares eased and were up 35 cents, or 1.4 percent, at $25.12 on the New York Stock Exchange. (Additional reporting by  Euan Rocha ; Editing by John Wallace and Maureen Bavdek)
