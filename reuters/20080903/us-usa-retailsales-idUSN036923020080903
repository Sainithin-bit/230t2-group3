 ATLANTA  (Reuters) - Major U.S. retailers are expected to post softer August sales as consumers spent less on back-to-school items, with the results helping to set analysts' expectations for the all-important holiday season. 

 Top retailers such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc ( WMT.N ), Target Corp ( TGT.N ) and Gap ( GPS.N ) are due to report monthly sales reports for stores open at least a year on Thursday. Industry forecasters have taken a grim view of the period overall, with the International Council of Shopping Centers expecting back-to-school sales at chain stores to rise 1 percent this year, their smallest gain since 2001. Analysts also expect retailers to report a 1 percent rise in August sales at stores open at least a year, worse than a 3.1 percent gain a year ago, according to Thomson Reuters research. A handful of retailers including Kohl's and J.C. Penney, issued same-store results on Wednesday, with each posting declines that were smaller than expected, but highlighting an overall trend of reduced spending. "We're not seeing any indication that the consumer has more money or feels better," Kohl's Chairman Larry Montgomery told a Goldman Sachs retail conference. Penney cited a difficult back-to-school season, and added September same-store sales would likely fall in the mid- to high-single digit percentages because of disruption from hurricanes. Retailers were pressured this year as higher fuel and food costs, a housing slump, rising unemployment and tighter credit have curbed consumers' discretionary income. Some investors have bet the recent ease in oil prices would alleviate pressure on consumers' budgets, but retail executives have not embraced that view. "While weather was a bright spot in August, we believe that the slowing economy negatively impacted traffic and sales," said Deborah Weinswig, an analyst at Citi Investment Research. WINNERS AND LOSERS Discounters and off-price retailers such as Wal-Mart and Ross Stores ( ROST.O ) are expected to turn in a relatively stronger performance as consumers looked for bargains. Specialty retailers and department stores, which have been challenged by weak clothing sales and declining mall traffic all year, are expected to continue to struggle. Teen stores are also expected to report weakness as back-to-school sales, the second-largest sales period for retailers, get pushed into September. "While back-to-school marketing and promotions kicked off in August, we see parents and teens putting off apparel purchases until September, after school starts," Standard & Poor's equity analysts said in a research note. Wal-Mart, the retail leader, is expected to post a rise of 1.6 percent in August same-store sales, its growth slowing from a 3.1 percent rise a year ago, according to Thomson Reuters. On Wednesday, No. 1 U.S. warehouse club Costco Wholesale Corp ( COST.O ) said its August same-store sales rose 9 percent as shoppers stocked up on food and cheaper gasoline. "The pace of economic activity has been slow in most districts," the U.S. Federal Reserve said in its Beige Book report on the state of the economy. "Many described business conditions as 'weak,' 'soft,' or 'subdued,'" the Fed said in its anecdotal economic assessment, compiled from reports by the 12 regional Federal Reserve banks. The ICSC said holiday sales should also be their weakest since 2001, predicting a rise of 3.6 percent compared with a 4.2 percent gain last year. The National Retail Federation said it expects total U.S. sales growth of 3.5 percent for 2008, compared with last year's 3.7 percent increase.
