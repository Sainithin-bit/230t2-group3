 DETROIT  (Reuters) - General Motors Corp said on Wednesday that U.S. light vehicle sales fell 20.3 percent in August to 308,817 units, pressured by the sharp downturn in demand for light trucks. 

 Overall, GM sales of light trucks fell 24.1 percent in August, while sales of cars fell 13.9 percent. Earlier on Wednesday, GM said it would extend its employee-pricing for all promotion through September covering nearly all of its 2008 model year vehicles and expanding the list to cover more of its 2009 model year vehicles.
