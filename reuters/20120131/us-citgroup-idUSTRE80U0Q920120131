 (Reuters) - CIT Group Inc ( CIT.N ) reported a fourth-quarter pretax profit excluding accounting adjustments related to its 2009 bankruptcy, reversing a year-earlier loss, as bad credit and borrowing costs declined. 
 The business lender, led by former Merrill Lynch Chief Executive John Thain, said net earnings fell 59 percent to $33.9 million, or 17 cents a share, from $83.2 million, or 41 cents a share, a year earlier. Analysts' average forecast was 2 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Because of ongoing accounting adjustments related to repayment of its debt, many analysts focus less on net earnings than on metrics such as loan growth, retirement of high-cost debt and growth of deposits -- all of which were positive in the fourth quarter. Pretax profit excluding accounting adjustments related to its bankruptcy was $140 million, compared with a year-earlier loss of $160 million. CIT, which operates under an agreement that subjects it to close scrutiny by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said it had restated downward its financial results for the first three quarters of 2011 and all of 2009 and 2010. It attributed the revision to $68 million of refunds to retailing and other clients in its trade finance unit relating to issues prior to its bankruptcy. The New York-based company said previously reported 2009 income was reduced by about $66 million, 2010 income by $1.8 million, and 2011 income by $500,000. The small and mid-market lender emerged from one of the largest bankruptcies in U.S. history in December 2009. Shares of CIT, which opened an online retail bank last year to attract low-cost funding, closed at $38 on Monday on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock price over the past year had a high of $48.77 and a low of $27.68. (Reporting by Jed Horowitz in New York and Tanya Agrawal in Bangalore; Editing by Supriya Kurane and John Wallace)
