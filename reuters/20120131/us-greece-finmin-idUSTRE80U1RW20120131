 ATHENS  (Reuters) - Greece's private sector creditors could take a loss of more than 70 percent in a planned debt swap, Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos said on Tuesday. 
 "There is a very serious discussion based on new facts. We are talking about a PSI much greater than the original," he told lawmakers, referring to private sector involvement in the deal. "We are talking about a haircut on the net present value exceeding 70 percent," he said. (Reporting by Lefteris Papadimas; Writing by  Ingrid Melander ; Editing by Ruth Pitchford)
