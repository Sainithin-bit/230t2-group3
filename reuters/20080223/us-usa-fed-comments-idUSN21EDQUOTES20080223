 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The following is a summary of recent comments by Fed policy-makers: 

 * Denotes 2008 voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets U.S. monetary policy. * DALLAS FED PRESIDENT RICHARD FISHER, FEB 22: "We have to be mindful of that fact that we have to create the conditions for employment growth, at the same time be careful that we don't stir the embers of inflation," he said. "And that represents the horns of a dilemma presently." "There is a question as to whether inflation expectations are well anchored." ST LOUIS FED PRESIDENT WILLIAM POOLE, FEB 20: "At any given time, policy-makers could pursue a powerfully expansionary policy to all but eliminate the possibility of a significant recession in the year ahead, but doing so would come at the cost and even likelihood of an unacceptable increase in the rate of inflation." * MINNEAPOLIS FED PRESIDENT GARY STERN, FEB 19: "We have to try to understand as more information on both market conditions and the market becomes available ... how the two align, and what is the appropriate thing to do." "We've already taken some significant action in my judgment." * FED GOVERNOR FREDERIC MISHKIN, FEB 15: "I believe that the Federal Reserve has been acting and will continue to act decisively, in the sense that our lowering of the federal funds rate target has reflected the evolution of the balance of risks to the macroeconomy. The disruption in financial markets poses a substantial downside risk to the outlook for economic growth, and adverse economic or financial news has the potential to cause further strains." CHICAGO FED PRESIDENT CHARLES EVANS, FEB 14: "The policy actions taken in January, in combination with earlier moves, should help promote growth over time and mitigate the risks to economic activity. "The effects of last fall's rate cuts are probably just being felt, while the cumulative declines should do more to promote growth as we move through the year. "Our goal of price stability must be defined in terms of total inflation ... if out-sized increases in food and energy prices persist, then core becomes a less useful medium-term guide." * FED CHAIRMAN BEN BERNANKE, FEB 14: The Fed "will be carefully evaluating incoming information bearing on the economic outlook and will act in a timely manner as needed to support growth and provide adequate insurance against downside risks. "A significant worsening in financial conditions or in credit availability would certainly be a warning bell that we need to take further actions. "Our policy stance must be determined in light of the medium-term forecast for real activity and inflation, as well as the risks to that forecast. "Any tendency of inflation expectations to become unmoored or for the Fed's inflation fighting credibility to be eroded could greatly complicate the task of sustaining price stability and reduce the central bank's flexibility to counter shortfalls in growth in the future." SAN FRANCISCO FED PRESIDENT JANET YELLEN, FEB 12: "We've got a significant threat here. We need to remain very focused on the downside risks to the economy. "In circumstances like these, we can't rule out the possibility of getting into an adverse feedback loop ... Indeed, an important objective of Fed policy is to mitigate the possibility that such a negative feedback loop could develop and take hold." (To access stories on Fed policy click on <FED/AHEAD>)
