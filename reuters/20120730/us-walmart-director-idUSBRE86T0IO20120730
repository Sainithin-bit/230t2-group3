 (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc ( WMT.N ) on Monday said that the retired chairman of accounting and consulting firm KPMG International KPMG.UL has joined its board of directors, effective immediately. 
 Timothy Flynn, 55, will serve as a member of the retailer's audit committee and becomes the seventeenth member of Wal-Mart's board. Flynn joined the board of JPMorgan Chase & Co ( JPM.N ) earlier this year. Wal-Mart has been embroiled in a bribery scandal at its Mexican operations, which are the subject of investigations by the U.S. Justice Department and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. In April, a New York Times report said that management at Wal-Mart de Mexico ( WALMEXV.MX ) orchestrated bribes of $24 million to help it grow quickly in the last decade and that Wal-Mart's top brass tried to cover it up.
