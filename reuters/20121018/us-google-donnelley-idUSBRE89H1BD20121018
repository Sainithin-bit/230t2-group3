 (Reuters) - Printing services firm R.R. Donnelley & Sons is investigating how Google Inc's quarterly earnings managed to get out hours ahead of schedule, the company told CNBC on Thursday. 
 Google blamed Donnelley, its securities filing agent, after a draft press release with third-quarter results was filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in the early afternoon. The results had been expected after the market close. (Reporting By  Ben Berkowitz ; Editing by  Bernard Orr )
