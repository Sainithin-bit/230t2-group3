 BOSTON  (Reuters) - The board of 3M Co ( MMM.N ) plans to name a successor to George Buckley as chief executive later this year, and aims to name an insider as the next leader of the diversified U.S. manufacturer. 

 "The board has been looking at issues of transition very closely; we've been doing it for years," Buckley, 63, told investors on Tuesday on a conference call. He said he expects a slow transition of power from him to his successor, noting: "It will all be very orderly; people will know everybody; it won't be a great surprise." Buckley's contract at the St. Paul, Minnesota-based company expires in February 2012. He took the reins in December 2005, after a five-year stint as CEO of Brunswick Corp ( BC.N ). The company earlier on Tuesday reported fourth-quarter profit that topped Wall Street's expectations. Buckley added that he intends to work for 3M as long as it needs him for the transition. "Unless I drop dead first, I'm going to work here as long as the board wants me to work here," Buckley said. "I'm not anxious to be going fishing just yet."
