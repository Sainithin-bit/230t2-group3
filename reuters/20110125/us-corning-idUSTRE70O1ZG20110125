The company saw a 79 percent increase in the segment that includes Gorilla Glass, the scratch-resistant thin glass that covers smartphones. Gross margins percentage also improved to 46 percent from 39 percent a year ago. Corning said it anticipated glass volume to increase by the mid-single digits next quarter.
