 HONG KONG  (Reuters) - Macau casino magnate Stanley Ho backtracked from an accusation that his family had stolen shares in his business empire, saying on Tuesday the dispute was a result of a "misunderstanding." 

 Ho had earlier said he had been left with almost nothing after a share restructuring he said was done without his consent. But he later struck a more conciliatory tone in a seeming bid to prevent the feud over his assets from escalating further. "Recently the Ho family controversy has lashed the entire city. I think it's time to stop," said Ho in a statement read by his third wife, Chan Un-chan, at her home late on Tuesday. The move came as concerns mounted over succession plans for the $10 billion casino company SJM Holdings ( 0880.HK ), after Ho's lawyer said the billionaire had not authorized the transfer of shares in a holding company to his family members that was announced on Monday. "This is robbery," Gordon Oldham, a senior partner at the Oldham, Li & Nie law firm quoted the tycoon as saying. But Ho said he wanted to resolve the matter behind closed doors and there was no need to take the matter to court. Holding firm Lanceford Co, whose shareholders include Ho's third wife and five children by his second wife, said the 89-year-old billionaire had approved in writing the transfer of the bulk of his assets to the family. "It is regrettable that Oldham, Li & Nie rushed to publicize these matters without checking the underlying facts in connection with the relevant transactions and we reserve our rights against that firm," it said. Ho confirmed in his latest statement he had signed such a document and Oldham would no longer serve as his lawyer. In a separate statement SJM said the Lanceford arrangement was a matter for the members of Ho's families to resolve and did not directly affect the company. It applied for its shares to resume trading on Wednesday. Ho, who started in his business career with just $10, built a lucrative gambling empire in the former Portuguese colony where he held a monopoly until 2002. In recent years, the territory has granted casino concessions to operators including Wynn Resorts Ltd ( WYNN.O ) ( 1128.HK ) and Las Vegas Sands Corp ( LVS.N ) ( 1928.HK ), who have helped transformed Macau from a tranquil enclave into a hub of neon lights and playboy bunnies. NEGATIVE NEWS The share restructuring, detailed in a filing to the Hong Kong stock exchange, said Ho would no longer have any attributable interest in Sociedade de Turismoe Diversoes de Macau SA (STDM), which controls SJM's parent, STDM - Investments Ltd, in turn controlled by Lanceford. Analysts said the dispute would inevitably weigh on SJM shares, which hit a record high last week. "Whenever there are family disputes, it's generally negative news and the stock will behave accordingly," said Andy Lam, a strategist at Harris Fraser in Hong Kong. Since the octogenarian's health deteriorated following brain surgery in 2009, speculation has swirled over the risks of a succession battle among the four women publicly recognized as his wives and at least 17 known children. Speaking earlier in the day, Oldham said Ho had threatened legal proceedings against his family in the next 48 hours unless the matter was resolved, and that the share transfers had been carried out without his consent and "against his wishes." Oldham would not talk about Ho's state of health except to say he was "very distressed" by his family's actions. Ho, however, later, said in the statement: "My health is very good. No one should worry." Ho's family members including daughter Pansy Ho and Daisy Ho, both directors of transport-to-property conglomerate Shun Tak Holdings Ltd ( 0242.HK ), were unavailable to comment. Ho, who was chauffeur driven to his third wife's home in a woolen cap and thick coat, avoided questions from a mass of reporters and declined to clarify his position, speaking only through intermediaries. Under the restructuring announced on Monday, the 26.8 percent stake in STDM held by Lanceford was transferred to family-run firms Action Winner Holdings Ltd and Ranillo Investments Ltd, which together now own Lanceford's 31.7 stake in STDM.
