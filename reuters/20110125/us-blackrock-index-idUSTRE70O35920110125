 BOSTON  (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc has stopped buying back its shares to aid its future inclusion in the Standard & Poor's 500 index, Chief Financial Officer Anne Marie Petach said on Tuesday. 

 New York-based BlackRock wants to maintain a so-called free-float of at least 50 percent of its shares, a key standard for inclusion in the index, Petach said on a call with analysts. (Reporting by  Aaron Pressman , editing by Gerald E. McCormick)
