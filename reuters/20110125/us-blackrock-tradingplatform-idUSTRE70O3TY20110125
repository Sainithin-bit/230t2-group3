 BOSTON  (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc's new internal securities trading platform will likely not be ready to begin operation until the second half of 2011, Chief Executive Officer Laurence Fink said on Tuesday. 

 New York-based BlackRock, the world's largest money manager, has been "spending a great deal of money" to build a system that will allow the firm's portfolio managers and customers to trade among themselves without relying on broker/dealers and public exchanges, Fink said in a call with analysts. BlackRock has previously said that the new system is expected to be available for both the $3.6 trillion of assets BlackRock manages in its own funds and another $10 trillion tracked for other customers on its risk management program called Aladdin.
