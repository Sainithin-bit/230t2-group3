 BOSTON  (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc Chief Executive Officer Laurence Fink said he has seen "no indication" that British bank Barclays Plc wants to sell any of the BlackRock shares it holds. 

 But if Barclays decided to sell the shares, which were acquired as part of the 2009 sale of its investment unit to BlackRock, BlackRock would try to use its free cash flow to buy back and retire the shares, Fink said in a call with analysts on Tuesday.
