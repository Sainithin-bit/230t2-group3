 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - MasterCard ( MA.N ) faces EU antitrust scrutiny this week over fees it charges shops to accept its credit and debit cards as part of a 1.3 trillion euro ($1.67 trillion) annual turnover. 

 The European Commission alleges the company restricted competition by setting minimum prices retailers must pay, and will open two days of closed hearings starting on Tuesday. The Commission is considering abolishing controversial and complex interbank fees charged by MasterCard, which can differ card by card. The probe is part of a larger look at the payment industry by the European Union's executive body and comes as EU Internal Market Commissioner Charlie McCreevy said he and his competition counterpart might team up to take tough, sector-wide action. McCreevy said he would not hesitate to get involved if he found evidence of abuse. (for story, click on nL13885456) Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said this year the area needed review because practices in the credit card industry pushed up payment card costs for consumers and businesses. MasterCard associate general counsel Carl Munson, in Brussels for the hearings, declined to discuss the case directly because of restrictions he said were imposed by the Commission. But he said the company's business practices were helpful to everyone involved. "We would argue that in the long run this is a benefit not just to cardholders but to merchants," he said. But Cecile Gregoire, an economist for EuroCommerce, a trade group of merchants, wholesalers and traders, argued that MasterCard used its power to charge high rates. And she said because most merchants did not impose surcharges for using credit cards, customers who paid cash subsidized the fees that merchants must pay banks. "The (fees) act like a tax on transactions, increasing the prices of all goods, even for consumers who do not pay with credit cards," she said. "Why should the merchant pay for this service?" she asked. Munson argued that merchants had a choice. "Cash is an alternative. Cheques are an alternative. The truth of the matter is that there are an awful lot of merchants that don't take debit cards," he said in a telephone interview. Replied Gregoire: "Commercially, most retailers cannot afford not to accept cards." In a public statement, the Commission said 85 percent of all merchants in the 28-country European Economic Area accepted the cards. MasterCard had 45 percent of the cards, sharing the market with Visa. A second issue is the requirement that all cards be honored. Gregoire said merchants could not tell the costs of each card, with some cards costing more than others. Nothing pops up to warn a merchant of higher fees on some cards than others, she said. Munson said merchants could telephone to find the costs of particular cards, but acknowledged there was no monthly accounting of the cost of each transaction each month. Gregoire also said MasterCard had hiked the costs of debit cards when it took over such an operation in Britain. She said that when MasterCard's Maestro took over the Switch system there, "there was a 60 percent increase in cost overnight". Munson said he lacked specific knowledge of those costs, but that the costs per transaction were usually only pennies. The overall 23 billion card payments made in the EU in 2004 added up to 1.35 trillion euros, the Commission said. ($1=.7775 euro)
