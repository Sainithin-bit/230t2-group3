 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The resignation of KB Home's ( KBH.N ) long-time chief over backdated stock options grants is focusing renewed attention on the big riches that home-building executives reaped in recent years. 

 Few people have ridden the housing wave as successfully as former KB Home CEO Bruce Karatz and other heads of publicly traded home builders, whose business exploded from late 2003 until the end of 2005 as consumers armed with low mortgages rushed to buy homes in hot markets. Since then, however, the sizzling housing market has slowed and home-building stocks have fallen. Karatz took in nearly $45.6 million in the fiscal year ended November 30, 2005, including base pay, bonus, restricted stock and stock option grants, up about 29 percent from $35.3 million in 2004, according to data compiled by Salary.com, a compensation specialist. KB Home's stock rose 39 percent in 2005, but shares are now down by about that same percentage so far this year as the housing market has cooled. Much of Karatz's 2005 earnings came from $27.9 million in restricted stock, almost double what he got a year earlier. Karatz agreed on Sunday to repay the Los Angeles-based company, the fifth-largest U.S. home builder, about $13 million in gains he received from mispriced stock options. But the two sides still must hash out other exit terms, including what happens to his millions of dollars worth of outstanding unvested stock options and restricted stock awards. The past few years have been particularly lucrative for heads of home-building companies, with compensation packages often tied to rising profit at their businesses. In announcing Karatz's departure, KB Home noted that the company's total annual revenue had soared to more than $9.4 billion in 2005, up from $1.4 billion a decade earlier. But critics of lofty executive compensation say the big paydays for home-builder chiefs in recent years were mostly a result of economic factors such as affordable mortgages that created the sizzling housing market -- not because of who was at the helm of these companies. "The housing industry was the beneficiary of low interest rates, so they were the beneficiary of that," Arthur Kroll, chief executive of executive compensation specialist KST Consulting, said of CEOs in the home-building sector. Last year, Toll Brothers Inc. ( TOL.N ) boss Robert Toll took in $37.9 million in base pay, bonuses, stock option grants and restricted stock, according to the Salary.com data. Much of that was from his bonus, which totaled $27.3 million. Other pay awards to home-building chiefs last year included $32.8 million to Lennar Corp. ( LEN.N ) chief Stuart Miller and $32.4 million to Ara Hovnanian of Hovnanian Enterprise Inc. ( HOV.N ), according to Salary.com.
