 STOCKHOLM  (Reuters) - Truck maker Volvo said on Monday it would cut about 1,000 staff at its Dublin, Virginia plant in the United States due to an expected decline in output. 

 After years of strong demand truck makers see a sharp drop in sales in the early months of 2007 as a buying spree of older, but cheaper, trucks ahead of new tougher exhaust emission rules, taking effect at the turn of the year, comes to an end. Volvo has said that the North American heavy-duty truck market could contract by as much as 40 percent during the first half of next year. "It is completely an adjustment to the expected volume declines due to the pre-buy effect in connection to the new emission rules," Volvo spokesman Marten Wikforss told Reuters. The staff cuts at the plant, where the firm assembles trucks of the Volvo and Mack brands, will begin in January next year and be completed during the first quarter. Volvo has already said it will cut 600 jobs at its subsidiary Mack Truck's plant in Hagerstown, Maryland, during the first six months of 2007. Wikforss repeated an earlier estimate that the total costs for the firm's cut-backs in the United States will weigh on fourth-quarter earnings to the tune of 100 million Swedish crowns ($14.13 million).
