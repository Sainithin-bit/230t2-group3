 BEIJING  (Reuters) - Motorola Inc. MOT.N, the world's second-largest cellphone maker, will supply China Telling Communications with $1.6 billion worth of phones in 2007, Yan Siqing, chief executive officer of the Shenzhen-based distributor of telecoms products, told reporters on Monday. 

 "Motorola will supply 12 million handsets in 2007 to Telling," said Yan. Motorola would supply the company with about six million cell phones this year, he said. Earlier this year, Motorola had said it expected to claim a quarter of China's handset market by the end of 2006, up from the 21 percent share it had in May. China's handset market is estimated to be growing by 25 to 30 percent a year, while Motorola aims to beat the industry's pace. Motorola competes against Nokia Oyj ( NOK1V.HE ), the world's top cellphone seller and largest mobile phone maker in China with a 28.4 percent share in April, according to industry data.
