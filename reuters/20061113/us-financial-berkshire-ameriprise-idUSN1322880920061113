 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. has lowered its stake in financial planning company Ameriprise Financial Inc. ( AMP.N ) to 6 percent from 9.8 percent in March, a Monday regulatory filing showed. 

 Berkshire and its subsidiaries owned 14.72 million shares of Minneapolis-based Ameriprise as of October 31, down from 23.92 million shares as of March 29, according to the filing. Ameriprise spokesman Paul Johnson declined to comment. American Express Co. ( AXP.N ), the credit card and travel services company, spun off Ameriprise in September 2005 in the form of a tax-free dividend to shareholders. Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire had a 12.2 percent Ameriprise stake following the spinoff. After it sold one-fifth of this investment, it said it expected to retain the remaining 9.8 percent stake "for the foreseeable future."
