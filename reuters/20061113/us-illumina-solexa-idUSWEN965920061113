 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Gene-testing technology company Illumina Inc. ( ILMN.O ) will acquire Solexa Inc. SLXA.O in a stock deal valuing the developer of genetic analysis systems at about $600 million, the companies said on Monday. 

 Solexa's stockholders will receive shares of Illumina valued at $14 per Solexa share. Solexa shares closed at $9.70 on Friday on the Nasdaq, resulting in a 44 percent premium for the deal. In addition, Illumina has agreed to invest $50 million in Solexa in exchange for newly issued Solexa shares. Shares of Illumina were at $40.88 in early electronic trading, down 7 percent from a Friday close of $44.05 on the Nasdaq. Solexa shares jumped to $13.30 in early electronic trade. The combined company will have a market opportunity of at least $2.25 billion, they said. The companies said they expect the deal to close by the end of the first quarter and to add to earnings modestly in 2008 and significantly thereafter. Illumina's financial outlook for 2006 remains unchanged. San Diego-based Illumina expects to maintain Solexa's operations in California and Cambridge, England.
