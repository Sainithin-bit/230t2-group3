 ZURICH, Nov 13 (Reuter) - West European banks are failing to disclose unfunded staff pension obligations running to billions of dollars, in contrast to U.S. banks which are required to show the full picture, Standard & Poor's said in a report on Monday. 

 Since adopting International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) in 2004, many European banks have used the so-called corridor method of accounting, allowing big unrecognized actuarial losses on their pension obligations to be kept off the balance sheet. "They are hiding behind the corridor method," said the report's author Eddie Khamoo. "The real picture which has emerged is that we have a huge amount of pension deficits which ultimately will require cash funding." The report on defined-benefit pension plans of 44 West European banks said the transition to IFRS reporting resulted in about 19 billion euros (US$24.4 billion) being charged directly to banks' retained earnings. "This amount permanently escapes being reported in earnings and represented 2 percent of the banks' shareholders' equity at (the time of) transition (to IFRS reporting)," said the report. Some Swiss and German banks adopted IFRS earlier and did not have to make the charge. Khamoo said the corridor accounting method should be scrapped. "We would encourage full disclosure," he said. Banks also had to come up with a funding plan for their pension liabilities. "This is something they have to face up to. These are very large amounts and they have to fund liabilities with related assets," said Khamoo. Since the transition to IFRS, a further 4 billion euros in costs had been charged directly to shareholders' equity and "9 billion euros has not been accounted for at all by banks that adopted the corridor method at January 1, 2004." When banks transferred to IFRS in January 2004, they set their books to zero, charging past actuarial losses to their accounts. "But in less than two years they have developed 9 billion euros of further actuarial losses. That's a hug sum of money for a short period of time," said Khamoo. The report said the risk arising from defined-benefit pension obligations amounted to an additional visible risk to many financial institutions "along with the more traditional banking factors of credit and market risk." Lloyds Bank ( LLOY.L ) had the highest pension obligations as a percentage of shareholders' equity at more than 160 percent at the end of 2005. Commerzbank ( CBKG.DE ) had the lowest, at around 20 percent. The overall net deficit for the banks in the survey rose by 16.7 percent over 2005. The corridor method was adopted by 35 of the 44 European banks in the survey and the banks that did not adopt it were mostly based in Britain and Ireland. United States accounting requirements are more onerous regarding pensions liabilities. "The FASB (Financial Accounting Standards Board) came up with new standards which are effective for U.S. public companies from December 2006 and they have to record the whole funded status into the balance sheet," said Khamoo.
