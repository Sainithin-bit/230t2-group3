 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Eddie Bauer Holdings Inc. EBHI.O, a clothing and accessories retailer, said on Monday it had accepted a $286 million cash takeover bid from two private equity firms, becoming the latest in a long line of retailers choosing to go private. 

 A company owned by affiliates of Sun Capital Partners Inc. and Golden Gate Capital will pay stockholders $9.25 per share, a 4.5 percent premium over Friday's closing Nasdaq price, and assume about $328 million in debt. The stock, which traded as high as $23.50 in December, was up 13 cents, or 1.5 percent, at $8.98 in afternoon trading. Eddie Bauer has struggled to revive a brand that traces its roots back to 1920. The company is best known for outdoor-inspired clothing and accessories, but has also licensed its name for products ranging from Ford Explorer trucks to baby strollers. The retailer operates some 375 stores, but analysts have long said that it had trouble setting itself apart from similar companies such as L.L. Bean and Sears Holdings Corp.'s ( SHLD.O ) Lands' End. "We believe that the transaction will provide Eddie Bauer with new resources and the time necessary to execute our turnaround strategy," Chief Executive Fabian Mansson said in a statement on Monday. Through affiliates, Sun Capital and Golden Gate own several retail and catalog brands, including department store chain Mervyn's; ShopKo Stores, which sells casual clothing, beauty items and housewares; and Marsh Supermarkets. All were previously publicly traded companies or part of larger public companies. Eddie Bauer had put itself up for sale in May, some 15 months after parent company Spiegel pulled it off the auction block for failing to get a high enough bid. The parties expect the deal to close in the first quarter, pending shareholder and regulatory approval. Eddie Bauer said its directors unanimously approved the deal and recommended that shareholders vote for it. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. ( GS.N ) was Eddie Bauer's financial adviser.
