 BOSTON  (Reuters) - Chip maker Freescale Semiconductor Inc. ( FSL.N ) said on Monday that its shareholders have approved the company's $17.6 billion sale to a group of private equity firms led by Blackstone Group. 

 Shareholders will be entitled to receive $40 per share upon closing of the deal, which could be the biggest-ever leveraged buyout of a technology company. The number of shares voted in favor of the sale represent about 73 percent of the company's voting shares. Freescale said it expects the deal to close in the fourth quarter of this year, pending customary closing conditions. Other firms in the consortium buying Freescale include the Carlyle Group, Permira Funds and Texas Pacific Group.
