 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - U.S. retailers will likely report modest sales growth this holiday season, with Wal-Mart Stores Inc. expected to be the top shopping destination, a survey conducted for Reuters this week shows. 

 The first in a series of holiday shopping polls by America's Research Group found that a surprisingly large 89 percent of respondents planned to shop at Wal-Mart this year, suggesting that the retailer's aggressive price cuts will succeed in luring more customers. Based on a random survey of 1,000 adults, conducted Wednesday through Friday, America's Research Group projected that holiday sales at stores open at least a year -- a key retail measure known as same-store sales -- would be up about 3.1 percent, roughly the same as last year. Reuters journalists will be tracking the survey responses throughout the holiday shopping season, which typically generates about one-fourth of retailers' annual sales. The next survey will examine shopping patterns on the Friday after Thanksgiving, also known as "Black Friday," the traditional start to the holiday shopping season. Wal-Mart, the world's biggest retailer, has announced markdowns on key toys, electronics and small appliances in recent weeks as it tries to reinvigorate sales growth following back-to-back months of disappointing results. Britt Beemer, head of America's Research Group, said he was "a little flabbergasted" by the high number of people who said they planned to shop at Wal-Mart. He had expected a figure closer to 70 percent, which is about how many have said they shopped Wal-Mart for holiday gifts in prior years' surveys. Of those who planned to avoid Wal-Mart this year, most said it was because they disliked the crowds. Less than 1 percent cited Wal-Mart's reputation, which has been hurt by increasingly vocal critics of its pay and benefits. The survey also found that some 72 percent planned to shop for electronics at Wal-Mart now that the retailer is carrying more recognized brands such as Panasonic televisions. "As they've added more name brands, it gives them more credibility for electronics," Beemer said. GETTING THE MESSAGE Shoppers are paying especially close attention to advertising this year, and nearly 95 percent said they would buy a big-ticket item on the day after Thanksgiving if it were advertised as part of "early bird" specials, when stores give bigger discounts to shoppers who arrive early. That was twice as many as in last year's survey. With customers listening more closely to advertising, retailers need to watch what they say. Some 53 percent of those polled said they were bothered by stores shunning "Merry Christmas" for the more generic "Happy Holidays." Wal-Mart, which faced sharp criticism in recent years for switching to "Happy Holidays," announced last week that it would bring Christmas signs back to its stores, and encourage greeters to say "Merry Christmas." Retailers also need to be sure that they have the staff to handle the crowds. The survey found that 64 percent of shoppers will avoid stores that are short-handed, up from 51 percent in last year's poll. Some 28.1 percent of consumers planned to entertain more at home this year, and spending on Christmas decorations was expected to rise, according to the survey, which has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.8 percent.
