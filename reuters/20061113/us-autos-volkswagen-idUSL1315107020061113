 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - U.S. financial investor Brandes Investment Partners has apparently cut its stake in German car maker Volkswagen ( VOWG.DE ) to less than 5 percent recently, a German newspaper said on Monday. 

 Quoting "well-informed sources", the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung said Brandes had apparently sold a large part of its stake, adding that the U.S. investor had bought most of its shares when the stock was trading at less than 40 euros each. VW closed flat at 80 euros on Monday. The German carmaker declined to comment, and Brandes was not immediately available for comment. Volkswagen had said in October last year that Brandes held voting shares of 8.58 percent as of September 30, 2005.
