 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Top U.S. meat producer Tyson Foods Inc. ( TSN.N ) posted its third consecutive quarterly loss on Monday, hurt by an oversupply of meat and by one-time charges, but predicted a profitable current quarter and fiscal year, sending its shares higher. 

 "The best thing I can say about fiscal 2006 is, it's over," Chief Executive Richard Bond said in a statement. Tyson is the nation's No. 1 producer of beef and chicken and No. 2 producer of pork. An excess of meat and higher prices for feed and fuel have hurt Tyson and other producers. To restore profits, Tyson this year initiated a $200 million cost-cutting plan, closed meat plants, and cut chicken production. "We think the worst is behind the industry. Given that we believe the time to buy commodity stocks is when earnings have troughed and have begun to improve, we think now is the time to buy Tyson," Diane Geissler, Merrill Lynch food analyst, said in a research report. Tyson reported a loss of $56 million, or 17 cents a share, for the fiscal fourth quarter, compared with a year-earlier profit of $117 million, or 33 cents per share. It took charges totaling $43 million, or 10 cents per share, relating to cost cutting, plant closings, and to tax and accounting issues. Excluding charges, the loss would have been 7 cents per share. On that basis, analysts' average forecast was for a loss of 4 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Tyson itself had predicted it would break even or post a loss up to 10 cents per share. Revenue for the fourth quarter was $6.471 billion, in line with Wall Street estimates but down from $6.495 billion a year earlier. The company posted a loss of $196 million, or 58 cents per share, for the year ended September 30. In the last three quarters it has posted losses of $235 million. But Tyson forecast a profit of 50 to 80 cents per share for the current year due in part to cost-saving measures. "We set a short-term goal to return to profitability, and based on our business performance to date, I am very confident we will achieve it in the first fiscal quarter of 2007," said Bond. Tyson shares were up 60 cents or 4.2 percent at $14.95 in afternoon trade on the New York Stock Exchange. Not all analysts were positive. Pablo Zuanic at J.P. Morgan said improvement in the beef and chicken segments may be slower than Tyson expects. "We rate Tyson neutral and do not agree with the almost substantial jump in the share price today. We believe fiscal year 2007 guidance assumes meaningful year over year improvements in chicken and beef economics, which we do not share," Zuanic said in a research report. The company does not provide quarterly forecasts but in a conference call with Wall Street analysts predicted a "very strong" second half of the year. The excess of chicken forced U.S. producers to cut production, and Tyson said it had cut output about 5 percent and that would not be added back in 2007. Tyson raises its own chickens for its poultry plants but buys cattle and hogs for its beef and pork operations, and higher corn prices have affected results. Corn prices reached a 10-year high at the Chicago Board of Trade in early November, largely due to increased demand from the growing ethanol industry, and that has increased meat production costs. "Higher grain costs are going to raise the cost of protein for the consumer -- this will also be true for beef and pork as well," said Bond. Meat analysts have said the latest oversupply of meat has been due to greater production. The U.S. Agriculture Department projects U.S. beef production in 2006 to rise 5.2 percent, pork to rise 2 percent and chicken to rise 1.4 percent.
