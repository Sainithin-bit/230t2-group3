 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rose on Monday as falling oil prices lifted shares of industrial bellwethers such as General Electric Co. ( GE.N ), but nervousness ahead of economic reports which set the course for interest rates limited a broader advance. 

 Analysts said there was also lingering uncertainty about the legislative agenda of the Democrats after they won control of Congress in last week's mid-term elections. Analysts fear the Democrats could pile pressure on big pharmaceuticals to cut prices and may consider curbing defense spending. Since the November 7 vote, the index of drug stocks is down 4.2 percent. "Oil is below $60 a barrel, which is positive," said Todd Leone, head of listed trading at Cowen & Co. in New York, but looking ahead, "you have a lot of economic numbers coming out this week. So people are nervous and they're not screaming to buy. You've also got the Democrats back in control of Congress." The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  was up 36.26 points, or 0.30 percent, at 12,144.69. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  was up 4.73 points, or 0.34 percent, at 1,385.63. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  was up 13.26 points, or 0.55 percent, at 2,402.98. U.S. crude for December delivery extended Friday's 2.6 percent drop on expectations that mild U.S. Northeast weather would slow heating demand. It was last down 55 cents at $59.04 a barrel. GE shares jumped 0.9 percent to $35.48 on the New York Stock Exchange, benefiting also from positive broker comments. Shares of another diversified manufacturer, Honeywell International Inc. ( HON.N ), gained 1.2 percent to $43.05, also on the NYSE. Citigroup added GE to its recommended list, along with chip maker Intel Corp. ( INTC.O ). Both stocks were among the top positive influences on both the Dow and the  S&P 500 Index. Intel shares rose 1.9 percent to $20.96, lending the biggest boost to the Nasdaq. On Tuesday, the Labor Department releases its October report on the Producer Price Index. That will be followed on Wednesday by the release of the minutes from the most recent meeting of the Federal Reserve's Federal Open Market Committee on October 24-25, when it held its benchmark federal funds rate steady at 5.25 percent for the third consecutive time. On Thursday, the Labor Department will release the October Consumer Price Index. Earnings results from some top retailers are expected on Tuesday, including No. 1 home improvement chain Home Depot Inc. ( HD.N ). (Additional reporting by  Caroline Valetkevitch )
