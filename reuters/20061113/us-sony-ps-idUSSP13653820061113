 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Sony Corp.'s ( 6758.T ) new PlayStation 3 game console has problems when playing about 200 software games from previous versions of the machine, the Sankei daily reported on Tuesday. Sony started selling the latest version of its blockbuster game console in Japan on Saturday, and video game magazine publisher Enterbrain has said it sold 88,400 units of the console in the first two days after the launch, leaving most stores without any stock. 

 The PS3 should be able to load and run games designed for earlier PlayStation models, but the paper said some sound and screen problems have been reported when these games were played on the new console. Officials at Sony's game division were not immediately available for comment. Sony is going up against Microsoft Corp.'s ( MSFT.O ) Xbox 360, on sale for the past year, and Nintendo Co.'s 7974.OS Wii, which will hit U.S. stores next week. Sony was able to ship only 100,000 units for the launch after a glitch in blue laser diode production disrupted its output plans. It plans to have the PS3 on shelves in North America on November 17, followed by a European launch in March.
