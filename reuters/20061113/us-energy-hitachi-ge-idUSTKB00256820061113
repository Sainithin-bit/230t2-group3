 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Hitachi Ltd. ( 6501.T ) said on Monday it has agreed with General Electric Co. ( GE.N ) to expand their global alliance in the nuclear power business, aiming to strengthen their position in a growing market. 

 The move comes a month after France's Areva CEPFi.PA, the world's largest maker of nuclear reactors, and Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries ( 7011.T ) said they would cooperate in this sector, while Toshiba Corp. ( 6502.T ) completed a $4.2 billion deal to take control of Westinghouse, the U.S. power plant unit of British Nuclear Fuels. "We aim to grow in the global nuclear power market, such as in advanced boiling-water reactors, by generating synergies with our expertise and experience," Hitachi said in a statement. Hitachi, which estimates that 100 more nuclear power plants will be built industry-wide in the next 20 years, said the two companies would form joint ventures in Japan and the United States to construct and maintain nuclear power plants. Hitachi said it would hold a news conference at 5 p.m. (3:00 a.m. EST). The Japanese venture will be 80 percent-owned by Hitachi and 20 percent by GE, while GE will own 60 percent of the U.S. venture with Hitachi taking the rest. The two companies will discuss details of the alliance and will sign a final contract in the first half of 2007. Before the announcement, shares in Hitachi closed up 0.4 percent at 699 yen, while the benchmark Nikkei average  .N225  fell 0.56 percent. GE ended trading on Friday down 0.3 percent at $35.17.
