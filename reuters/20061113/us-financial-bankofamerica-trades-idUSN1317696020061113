 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Bank of America Corp. ( BAC.N ), whose introduction of free online stock trading last month roiled the brokerage industry,, on Monday expanded the program to seven mid-Atlantic and Southeast states, and said it is speeding up the program's nationwide introduction. 

 The program lets investors make up to 30 free online equity trades per month through Banc of America Investment Services Inc. if they deposit at least $25,000 in Bank of America accounts. It is intended to encourage people to do more business at the No. 2 U.S. bank, which operates more than 5,700 branches. Bank of America introduced the program in the U.S. Northeast last month. Monday's expansion extends the program to Alabama, the District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Maryland, North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia. "The process is moving quicker than we originally planned, largely because of the strong market demand we've seen," spokesman Jon Goldstein said. He declined to say how much business the bank is attracting with the offer. The Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank now expects to complete the nationwide roll-out in early 2007. It previously expected to complete the roll-out next spring. The bank has about 1.6 million brokerage customers. Rivals have not raced to match Bank of America's lowered fees. The surprise October 11 launch of the program sent shares of rivals such as Charles Schwab Corp. SCHW.O, E*Trade Financial Corp. ET.N and TD Ameritrade Holding Corp. ( AMTD.O ) down several percent that day. Bank of America shares fell 4 cents to $54.73 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
