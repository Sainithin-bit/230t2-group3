 NEW YORK/LONDON  (Reuters) - Gene-testing technology company Illumina Inc. will acquire Solexa Inc. in a stock deal valuing the developer of genetic analysis systems at about $600 million, the companies said on Monday. 

 The deal crystallises value in Solexa, a company which was originally founded in Britain and believes it has found a bargain-basement way to sequence whole individual genomes for a few thousand dollars. Mapping the first draft of the archetypal human genome, the "book of life" that includes all the genes in the human body, took 10 years and cost $1 billion. It was finally completed to much fanfare in 2000. Solexa's stockholders will receive shares of Illumina valued at $14 per Solexa share. Solexa shares closed at $9.70 on Friday on the Nasdaq, resulting in a 44 percent premium for the deal. In addition, Illumina has agreed to invest $50 million in Solexa in exchange for newly issued Solexa shares. Shares of Illumina fell 8.3 percent to $40.38 in morning trade on the Nasdaq, while Solexa surged 32.7 percent to $12.87. The two firms said the combined group would have a market opportunity of at least $2.25 billion and would be the only business with genome-scale technology for genotyping, gene expression and sequencing -- three key modern analytical tools. Solexa expects its first-generation instrument will enable human genome resequencing for less than $100,000 a sample, and the longer-term goal is to reduce this to a few thousand dollars, making it suitable for both basic research and clinical diagnostics. The companies said they expected the deal to close by the end of the first quarter and to add to earnings modestly in 2008 and significantly thereafter. Illumina's financial outlook for 2006 remains unchanged. San Diego-based Illumina expects to maintain Solexa's operations in California and Cambridge, England.
