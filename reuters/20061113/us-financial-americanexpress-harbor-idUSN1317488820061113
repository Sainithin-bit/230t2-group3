 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - American Express Co. ( AXP.N ) is close to announcing that it will purchase corporate payments management company Harbor Payments, a move that will expand the credit card issuer's processing business, a source close to the deal said on Monday. 

 The purchase is expected to be announced as soon as this week, and completed by the end of the year. Christine Levite, a spokeswoman for American Express, declined to comment, citing a policy against commenting on rumors. A marketer at closely-held Harbor was not immediately available to comment. Atlanta-based Harbor Payments was formed in 2000 and employs about 200 people. It offers products that streamline invoices and payments between businesses. The company has an additional operation and service facility in San Antonio, Texas, and a technology center in Bangalore, India. In August 2005, Oak Investment Partners provided venture capital to Harbor Payments. (Additional reporting by  Gelu Sulugiuc  in Copenhagen)
