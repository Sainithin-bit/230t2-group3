 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Bids are due on Monday for Clear Channel Communications Inc. ( CCU.N ), with two private equity groups expected to make offers for the No. 1 U.S. radio company, whose market value tops $17 billion. 

 Clear Channel, which has about 1,150 stations, said last month that it was evaluating strategic alternatives for its business and had hired investment bank Goldman Sachs & Co. ( GS.N ) to advise it. Sources familiar with the situation said on Sunday that bids were due on Monday and that proposals were expected from two consortia. Providence Equity Partners, Blackstone BG.UL and KKR KKR.UL make up one consortium, while the other consists of Bain Capital, Thomas H. Lee Partners THL.UL and Texas Pacific Group TPG.UL. Details of any bids are not likely until late on Monday or early Tuesday, sources familiar with the process said. KKR, Thomas H. Lee, Texas Pacific, Bain, Clear Channel and Goldman Sachs declined comment. Blackstone and Providence were not available for comment. Clear Channel shares fell 1.2 percent to $34.55 in morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange. PRICE A number of analysts have share price targets for Clear Channel in the mid-$30s and upward. Deutsche Bank, in a recent note, said its target of $36 took into account the possibility that Clear Channel would eventually accept a bid to go private. Bank of America analysts last month raised their fair-value range on the shares to $34-$40 from $34-$38, saying there were multiple strategic options the group could pursue, including taking the entire company private and spinning off its outdoor unit. Clear Channel has a majority ownership in outdoor advertising group Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings Inc. ( CCO.N ). Other interested parties have also been named by media reports. The Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday that two groups thought to be interested -- Apollo Management and Carlyle, and Cerberus Capital and Oak Hill Partners -- had largely faded out of the picture. Clear Channel, based in San Antonio, Texas, recently forecast strong fourth-quarter radio-advertising sales. It posted a 9.5 percent drop in third-quarter profit, reflecting the spinoff of its entertainment unit. Advertising-driven radio broadcasters such as Clear Channel have been challenged to develop new formats and technology in the face of growing competition from satellite radio, the Internet, and personal digital music players. Private equity firms typically buy companies with a small portion of their own cash and borrow the rest. They usually hold a business for three to five years, restructure it, then sell it, either to a buyer or on the open market in an initial public offering. In some cases, buyout firms "flip" an investment in a year or less when they think they can make a good profit. (Additional reporting by  Sue Zeidler  in Los Angeles)
