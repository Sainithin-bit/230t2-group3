 SHANGHAI  (Reuters) - Yum Brands Inc. ( YUM.N ) is pushing ahead with plans to add more drive-thru restaurants to its KFC business in China, but is taking a more cautious approach than rival McDonald's Corp. ( MCD.N ), the top executive for that market said on Monday. 

 The fast-food company plans to open 100 KFC drive-thrus in China over the next three years, Yum China President Sam Su said, calling that plan very aggressive. The company currently has four drive-thrus in China. Su added, however, that he did not see the need for half of KFCs new outlets to have drive-thrus. McDonald's has said that at least 50 percent of its new restaurants in China would be drive-thrus as it looks to cash in on a rapid rise in car ownership in the world's most populous country. "I'm not sure I share completely that sentiment," Su said in an interview. "The car has become almost a home away from home for Americans. That's not necessarily the same in China." McDonald's is the world's largest restaurant company by sales, but has a much smaller presence in China than KFC. Yum operates more than 1,700 KFC restaurants in China and opens a new one every day on average. McDonald's has about 770 restaurants in China and plans to open about 100 a year. Car ownership is growing rapidly in China due to a booming economy that has increased consumers' ability to make big-ticket purchases. Car sales rose 27 percent in 2005 and could climb an additional 29 percent this year, according to trade magazine Automotive News. That kind of growth, along with strong performances at its existing drive-thrus, prompted McDonald's earlier this year to sign a deal with China oil giant Sinopec ( 0386.HK ) to jointly develop drive-thrus at some of the gas station operator's 30,000 locations in China. McDonald's now has six drive-thrus there. Su said KFC had made similar agreements with other retailers in China and would talk about those deals once the drive-thrus are up and running. Approaching Chinese retailers and landlords about building drive-thrus is a challenge because many are not yet familiar with the concept, he said. Nevertheless, drive-thru is one of several ways KFC is looking to expand its fast-growing business in China. Other opportunities include opening locations in airports and expanding its breakfast menu, Su said. Breakfast, he said, makes up a small portion of KFC's overall sales, but is a growing opportunity as Chinese consumers become more strapped for time. "More and more people for breakfast don't want to cook anymore and just want to grab something and go," he said. "The opportunity is very very good," he said. KFC's breakfast menu has Western-style products like a sausage-and-egg sandwich, but also has traditional Chinese items such as congee, a kind of rice porridge. KFC is also looking into adding a delivery service and expanding its business hours. McDonald's has said its growing number of 24-hour stores in China had helped boost sales in that market this year. But Su said KFC was "not jumping into 24 hours. We don't see enough evidence that there is big demand for it." Still, the more different KFC and McDonald's are, the better for both companies, Su said. McDonald's, for instance, has been aggressively marketing its primary beef menu in China, while KFC is centered around chicken.
