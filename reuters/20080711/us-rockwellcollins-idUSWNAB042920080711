 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Aerospace electronics company Rockwell Collins Inc ( COL.N ) reported a 19 percent rise in quarterly profit on Friday, helped by expanding margins in its government and commercial businesses. 

 The company, which supplies Boeing Co ( BA.N ), Airbus parent EADS ( EAD.PA ) and the U.S. military with a range of cockpit and cabin gear, also raised its full-year earnings forecast. For the fiscal third quarter ended June 30, net income rose to $174 million, or $1.07 per share, from $146 million, or 86 cents per share, a year earlier. Analysts' average profit forecast was $1.02 a share, according to Thomson Reuters Estimates. Quarterly sales increased 7 percent to $1.19 billion. Rockwell Collins raised its earnings forecast for the full fiscal year to a range of $4.05 to $4.10 per share from a previous range of $3.95 to $4.05. Chief Executive Clay Jones said in a statement that looking forward into fiscal 2009, "we believe the impact of robust commercial original equipment manufacturer delivery schedules and a steady increase in defense spending will more than offset the broadly anticipated reductions in airline capacity." U.S. airlines are slashing capacity, retiring planes, cutting jobs and introducing fees to survive amid sky-high fuel prices. Rockwell Collins said third-quarter sales of its commercial systems rose 8 percent to $587 million, and sales of its government systems climbed 7 percent to $607 million. The company said it expects full-year sales of $4.75 billion. (Reporting by  Mark McSherry ; editing by John Wallace)
