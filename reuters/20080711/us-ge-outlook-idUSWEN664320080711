 BOSTON  (Reuters) - General Electric Co said on Friday it expects third-quarter profits to be flat or down at its finance arms. 

 The company forecast that commercial finance profit would fall 10 to 15 percent, with GE Money consumer finance flat to down 5 percent. It also forecast a 20 to 30 percent decline in profit at its industrial division. At its infrastructure unit, its largest business, it sees profit up around 20 percent, with profit seen flat to up 5 percent at both health care and NBC Universal media. The U.S. conglomerate made the disclosures in slides posted to its web site ahead of a conference call with analysts. Earlier on Friday GE said it expects overall third-quarter profit to come to 50 to 54 cents per share, flat to up 8 percent from a year earlier. (Reporting by  Scott Malone , editing by Gerald E.
