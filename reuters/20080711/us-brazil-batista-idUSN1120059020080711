 RIO DE JANEIRO  (Reuters) - Brazilian police searched and took documents from the home and offices of Brazilian billionaire Eike Batista on Friday, as part of a probe into alleged fraud, the police said. 

 Shares in Batista's power plants and mining company MMX Mineracao ( MMXM3.SA ), fell nearly 10 percent while those in his OGX ( OGXP3.SA ) energy exploration firm fell 10.5 percent. His mining and electricity firm MPX Energia SA MPXE3.SA tumbled 11.3 percent. Police said the investigation was into possible fraud involved in the concession for a railroad, run by a company he sold earlier this year, in the northern state of Amapa. "There are indications of diverting of tenders so that companies of the same group would win," the federal police said in a statement. Batista was not immediately available for comment. MMX Amapa, which runs the railway under investigation, denied in a statement that it had committed "any type of irregularity or illicit action related to the railway's tender in favor of this company." Batista has become one of Brazil's richest men, working his way up from gold mining to control a stable of oil, power, transport and mining companies. Batista, 51, sold two iron ore projects, including MMX Amapa, to Anglo American Plc ( AAL.L ) for $5.5 billion this year. Last month, Batista launched the biggest IPO in Brazilian history, raising 6.71 billion reais ($4.2 billion) in the debut of OGX Petroleo e Gas Participacoes.
