 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - InBev NV INTB.BR raised its takeover offer for Anheuser-Busch Cos Inc ( BUD.N ) by $5 a share to $70 in an effort to seal a friendly deal, the Wall Street Journal reported on its website on Friday, citing a person familiar with the matter. 

 Anheuser's board is likely to accept the offer this weekend, the paper said, citing a person familiar with the matter, adding that so-called social issues, including what the combined company would be called, still need to be worked out. InBev declined comment on the report. (Reporting by  Martinne Geller , editing by Gerald E. McCormick)
