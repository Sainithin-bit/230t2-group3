 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Standard & Poor's said on Friday the counterparty credit rating of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc LEH.N continues to reflect the company's solid liquidity and funding profile despite pressure on its stock. 

 S&P said Lehman's counterparty credit risk rating is "A," the sixth-highest investment grade. The counterparty credit rating reflects how well the company can meet its financial obligations with trading partners, customers or other parties. The outlook is negative, indicating the likely direction of the rating over the next two years. S&P's comments came as concerns about the counterparty risk of major credit derivative dealers rose to the highest since the week of the Bear Stearns bailout in March, as markets worried about possible federal intervention at U.S. mortgage finance giants Fannie Mae FNM.N and Freddie Mac FRE.N. Lehman stock has fallen roughly 40 percent this week as the investment bank was battered by rumors -- later discredited -- that some key counterparties had pulled business away from it. S&P said the persistent and ongoing pressure on Lehman's stock price in recent days has not hurt Lehman's liquidity, funding and client business. But the rating firm expressed concerns that these pressures complicate the operating environment for Lehman, which was downgraded in June. "We are concerned that ill-founded and persistent pressures on Lehman's stock unnecessarily prolong what is already a very challenging business environment," it said. S&P's comments failed to calm market worries over counterparty risk, however. The CDR Counterparty Risk Index, which measures the average credit spread of the 15 largest credit derivative dealers, widened 6.4 basis points to 152 basis points, and is 9.6 basis points weaker on the week, according to Credit Derivatives Research, which manages the index. The index is the weakest since March 20, the week when the Federal Reserve orchestrated the bailout of Bear Stearns. Lehman Brothers was the  weakest performer among 15 dealers on Friday, as the cost to insure its debt against default surged 43 basis points while its share price fell nearly 20 percent. In early trading, Lehman Brothers' five-year credit default swaps rose to 380 basis points, or $380,000 to insure $10 million of debt a year. The spread on its 5.625 percent notes due in 2013 widened 28 basis points to 405 basis points over U.S. Treasuries, the highest since late March, according to MarketAxess.
