 PHILADELPHIA  (Reuters) - InBev NV INTB.BR and Anheuser-Busch Cos Inc ( BUD.N ) have begun active negotiations for a friendly merger, a source familiar with the situation said on Friday. 

 Anheuser-Busch had been a reluctant takeover target, spurning InBev's $46.3 billion takeover bid and fighting efforts to have the Belgian brewer replace its board of directors. Media reports said InBev had raised its bid to $70 per share, up from $65 per share, and a deal could be sealed this weekend. InBev declined to comment. Anheuser-Busch could not be immediately reached for comment. (Reporting by  Jessica Hall , editing by Gerald E. McCormick) (For more M&A news and our DealZone blog, go to  here )
