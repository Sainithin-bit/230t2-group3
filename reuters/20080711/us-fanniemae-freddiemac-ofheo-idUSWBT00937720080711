 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Mortgage finance companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac currently have strong capital, access to credit and available assets, the companies' regulator said on Thursday. 

 "At a very difficult time in the market, the Enterprises have the flexibility and sound operations needed to support their mission," said the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight. (Reporting by Patrick Rucker; Editing by Dan Grebler)
