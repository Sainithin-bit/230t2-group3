 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - InBev INTB.BR, the world's second-largest beer producer by volume, declined on Friday to comment on a report that it had increased its offer for U.S. peer Anheuser-Busch ( BUD.N ) to $70 per share from $65. 

 The Wall Street Journal said on its website that InBev's higher offer was an effort to seal a friendly deal and that Anheuser was likely to accept it this weekend. (Reporting by  Philip Blenkinsop )
