 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - General Electric Co reported earnings on Friday that met expectations, but revenues were higher than analysts had forecast, helped by strength in its industrial business. 

 Earnings from continuing operations for the second quarter were $5.4 billion, or 54 cents per share, matching Wall St. estimates, while revenues rose 11 percent to $46.9 billion. Net earnings fell 6 percent to 5.1 billion, or 51 cents per share. "Many markets and industries remain healthy, while the U.S. economy is challenged," said Chairman and CEO Jeff Immelt. GE's stock was up 2.2 percent immediately following the results announcement.   COMMENTS JUSTIN URQUHART STEWART, DIRECTOR AT 7 INVESTMENT  MANAGEMENT, LONDON: "What I worry about with the GE figures is they're merely telling us what has happened, which is a rotten predictor of what is going to happen. The concern I've got is analysts' and company expectations still need to be brought down further because growth levels are going to be weaker. "This should then be reflected in the share price and make life more realistic. That is a good sign and a healthy sign that we are more realistic about the future and not trying to believe that what has happened over the past four years is going to happen over the next four years. BRIAN LANGENBERG, PRINCIPAL AT LANGENBERG & CO, NY "The really big and key businesses continue to do really well: aviation, energy, oil and gas. I am encouraged by a lot of what's going on in a lot of the core business. It was a decent quarter. "The concerns I have is this, until the first quarter of this year, GE found a way to earn the number. The first quarter they couldn't do it and that was the first time they did that since most of us were in diapers. "The fact of the matter is they are barely beating last year's earnings in what is still strong up cycle for much of their core businesses. If you look at any other industrial company they're showing strong improvement year-on-year, so I'm not impressed that it's less bad. MIKE LENHOFF, CHIEF STRATEGIST AT BREWIN DOLPHIN IN LONDON "The revenue side looks very good. Certainly without even seeing the expectation of revenues, the top-line looks pretty good. Hells bells, we've only had a handful of stocks before the reporting season really gets underway next week but this is obviously very good. Better to have this than the opposite. "Going into the season, we've got a decent lead - decent results from Alcoa. That's exactly what this market needs ... the earnings results will be a good test to whether expectations have caught up with reality and if the results come in at least in-line then that says that the analysts will not be cutting their second half earnings estimates much more. "That stability in earnings expectations will have a settling influence on the markets. It's quite good that we've had two key companies, with results that look quite favorable." BUCKY HELLWIG, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT AT MORGAN ASSET  MANAGEMENT, BIRMINGHAM, ALABAMA "At this point the most positive takeaway is the fact that they said they will beat their full year guidance. If the company would have met expectations and the outlook had deteriorated that would have put more pressure on him (Jeff Immelt). "This report is the implication that they're trying to control the events in terms of reacting to what's going on in the market. There's ongoing progress on dealing with the tough environment that's out there, especially on the financial side. "It's a broadly diversified company and so as a snapshot for our economy, if you want to use it as a proxy, it shows that things are still tough, there are issues out there with regard to the slowing GDP growth and with deteriorating credit quality on the financial side an those will probably be with us for a few more quarters." FRANK SCHNEIDER, PORTFOLIO STRATEGIST AT ALPHA TRADING,  FRANKFURT "The numbers for the second quarter were in line and the outlook was confirmed, so its not majorly disappointing but personally I didn't like the third-quarter outlook which was at the bottom end of expectations at 50-54 while the consensus was 54 cents. "So there is some relief but it wasn't a convincing performance and I am wondering whether they can hold on to gains." JACK ABLIN, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, HARRIS PRIVATE BANK  IN CHICAGO "One, Jeff Immelt is off the hook. Two, GE is in many respects a microcosm of the market, they are in industrials, they're in healthcare, and they're in finance, and to be able to put together a solid profit report, that reflects very well for the both company and the private sector. "Based on this we should get a relief rally (in the stock market). Given GE's reach, it would be across all sectors." PERRY ADAMS, VP AND SENIOR PORTFOLIO MANAGER, HUNTINGTON  PRIVATE FINANCIAL GROUP, TRAVERSE CITY, MICHIGAN "They had a very solid quarter in terms of, No. 1., in meeting consensus, which was 54 cents. Infrastructure had a very solid quarter ... more important was commercial finance and GE Money. "There was a lot of concern as to the credit crisis that was going on and how it was going to effect GE Money. They were down 9 percent, but consensus had them down 15-20 percent ... that's just a testament to the weakness of the U.S. consumer, but it's also a testament to the risk management of GE in terms of not stretching for earnings and taking inappropriate risk." MARK PRIEST, TRADER, TRADINDEX, LONDON "It seems a little bit better than expected. Their shares are rallying on the back of them. We take that as a good sign but the price of oil is outweighing everything today." TIM GHRISKEY, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, SOLARIS ASSET  MANAGEMENT, NEW YORK "I think it's a settled quarter, a more normal GE quarter than the last one that was a disappointment. So it's a sigh of relief for GE shareholders. Revenues were a little better than expected, at least it hasn't deteriorated further in an environment that is certainly dicey, for a company with so much financial exposure. "The health segment that had been a problem has also settled down and normalized. We might look at the last report as an aberration. DAVID BUIK, STRATEGIST, BCG PARTNERS, LONDON "Bang in line with expectation -- 54 cents, but the outlook is maybe a pip better than expected at approximately $2.30. Probably unrealistic to have expected more in the current climate."
