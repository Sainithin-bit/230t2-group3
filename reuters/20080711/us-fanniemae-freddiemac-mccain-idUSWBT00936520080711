 BELLEVILLE, Michigan  (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate John McCain said on Thursday a government bailout of mortgage finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac was not necessary now. 

 "At this time I don't think that there is a requirement for a government bailout," he told reporters in Michigan. McCain said he would be looking at all options, however, and reiterated that the two institutions must not fail. (Reporting by  Jeff Mason ; editing by Gary Crosse)
