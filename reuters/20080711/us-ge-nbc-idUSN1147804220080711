 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - General Electric Co expects upfront ad sales of $4.3 billion at its NBC Universal media unit for the 2008-2009 season, up from $4 billion last year, GE Chief Financial Officer Keith Sherin said on Friday. 

 NBC also expects advertising sales from the Beijing Olympics of about $1 billion, Sherin said on a conference call with analysts. "The summary for NBC is robust cable growth, film positioned for a nice second half, a very strong second half and another on-track quarter," Sherin said.
