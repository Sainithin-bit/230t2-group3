 (Reuters) - Economists are deeply divided over whether the U.S. Federal Reserve should focus more on fostering growth or keeping inflation in check, The Wall Street Journal said citing its forecasting survey. 

 Of 53 economists polled, 22 said the U.S. central bank should be more concerned about economic weakness than inflation, while 21 said inflation should be the greater concern, the paper said. The rest said the risks were balanced or declined to answer. "The damage from letting inflation percolate and remain in the system will trigger an even bigger economic slump down the road," Alliance Bernstein economist Joseph Carson, was quoted by the Journal as saying. However, Lehman Brothers economist Ethan Harris told the paper that the housing downturn and fragile capital markets make a weakening economy the more pressing concern "The average person is saying, 'I'm worried about inflation because I can't get a wage increase,'" Harris was quoted by the paper as saying. "It's not, 'I'm worried about inflation and therefore I'm going to ask my boss for a raise.'" Many of the economists surveyed raised their estimates for second-quarter growth, reflecting a bigger-than-expected increase in consumption because of the economic-stimulus checks sent out by the government in recent months, the paper said. On average, respondents believed U.S. gross domestic product grew at a 1.4 percent annual rate in the second quarter, up from the 0.5 percent they forecast in June, the paper said. The survey, however, revealed that fewer than one in five economists said that a federal stimulus package prevented a recession; most said it merely delayed one, or had no effect at all. "The stimulus package has softened the downturn, but will not change the ultimate outcome," Goldman Sachs economist Jan Hatzius was quoted by the paper as saying. The economists who are more worried about inflation gave lower marks to Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke than did those concerned primarily about economic growth, the paper said, adding they gave higher marks to European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet, who has voiced much more concern over higher prices than Bernanke has. The cited economists could not be immediately reached for comment. (Reporting by  Ajay Kamalakaran  in Bangalore, Editing by Jacqueline Wong)
