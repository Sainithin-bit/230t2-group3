 BOSTON  (Reuters) - General Electric Co expects to spin off its consumer and industrial businesses to shareholders in the first half of next year, the company's chief financial officer said on Friday. 

 "We've targeted first-half '09 execution," Keith Sherin said on a conference call with investors. "It's not really dependent on M&A or equity market conditions." GE said on Thursday it would seek to spin off to shareholders its consumer and industrial operations, which make products including lighting and washing machines and generate about $13 billion in annual revenue. Previously the company had focused on selling just its appliance unit, and had named several Asian companies as possible bidders. (Reporting by  Scott Malone )
