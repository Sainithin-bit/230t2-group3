 SINGAPORE  (Reuters) - Singapore Airlines ( SIAL.SI ), the world's largest carrier by market value, may ask its pilots from its cargo arm to take unpaid leave in a bid to cut costs and reduce capacity, a newspaper reported on Wednesday. 

 Singapore Air told the Business Times that it was already in talks with pilots from its cargo fleet about implementing the cost cutting measures as a way to avoid retrenchments. "The cargo business position is very weak at this point in time and the outlook for 2009 is not good," Singapore Air spokesman Stephen Forshaw told the Business Times. Forshaw also said if the voluntary unpaid leave scheme fails to alleviate the cost situation, pay cuts and retrenchments could follow. The airline is also looking to park some of its cargo carriers. Singapore Air reported earlier this month that it filled 67.3 percent of the space available on its planes for passengers and cargo in November, down from 70.6 percent a year ago. Singapore Airlines Cargo has a pool of about 300 pilots. The airline could not be reached for comment. (Reporting by  Melanie Lee , editing by Leslie Gevirtz)
