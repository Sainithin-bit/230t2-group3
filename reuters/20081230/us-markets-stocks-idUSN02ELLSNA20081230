 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Stocks climbed on Tuesday after the government expanded its bailout of the auto industry, bolstering hopes lawmakers would continue to take steps to minimize the severity of the year-long recession. 

 The Bush Administration said late Monday it would extend an additional $1 billion loan to General Motors Corp ( GM.N ) and take a $5 billion stake in the automaker's financing arm, GMAC, in the latest move to ease the credit crisis. "The GMAC news is the driver of the lot." said Steve Sachs director of trading at Rydex Investments, Rockville, Maryland. "The government has been telling us for months that they will do whatever it takes and there is probably more of it in store as we get to the inauguration and a few weeks past that." The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  rose 184.46 points, or 2.17 percent, to 8,668.39. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  gained 21.21 points, or 2.44 percent, to 890.63. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  added 40.38 points, or 2.67 percent, to 1,550.70. The Dow is down 1.8 percent month-to-date after closing down 5.3 percent in November and 34.7 percent year-to-date. The S&P has risen almost 18 percent since hitting an 11-year low on November 20, but is still down about 40 percent for 2008. The Nasdaq was boosted by shares of big-cap technology companies that have larger cash reserves and are seen as better positioned to withstand the economic slump. Shares of Qualcomm Inc ( QCOM.O ), the wireless chip maker, rose 2.5 percent to $34.94, while software maker Oracle Corp ORCL.O gained 3.5 percent to $17.83, putting them among the top boosts on the Nasdaq. International Business Machines Corp ( IBM.N ) was the leading advancer on the Dow, rising 2.8 percent to $83.55. Investors shrugged off another round of economic reports that pointed to a deepening recession. Prices of single-family homes plunged a record 18 percent in October, while consumer confidence also fell to a record low. In an effort to stem the tide of the recession, U.S. lawmakers have extended aid to a slew of companies, most recently to automakers GM and privately held Chrysler LLC. On Tuesday, GMAC announced easier financing terms for car and truck buyers and GM announced zero percent financing for some vehicles, which could help bolster sales. Earlier this month, the government agreed to extend a $17.5 billion lifeline to GM and Chrysler in an attempt to prevent their potential collapse which could have led to hundreds of thousands of jobs lost and further weakened the economy. GM rose 5.6 percent to $3.80, while Ford added 3.2 percent to $2.29. Rohm & Haas ROH.N jumped 11.9 percent to $59.70 after the Financial Times reported Dow Chemical ( DOW.N ) could tap a $13 billion bridge loan or renegotiate the price to salvage its $15 billion planned takeover of the company. The deal was jeopardized after Kuwait decided to scrap a joint venture with Dow Chemical over the weekend, depriving Dow Chemical of financing it planned to use for the acquisition. Dow rose 1.5 percent to $15.55. Volume was slim on the New York Stock Exchange, where about 948.8 million shares changed hands, far below last year's estimated daily average of 1.90 billion. On the Nasdaq, about 1.4 billion shares traded, well below last year's daily average of 2.17 billion. Advancers outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by a ratio of about 4 to 1, while on the Nasdaq about two stocks rose for every one that rose. (Editing by Leslie Adler)
