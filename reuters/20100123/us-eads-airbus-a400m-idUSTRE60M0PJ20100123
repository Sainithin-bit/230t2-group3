 BERLIN  (Reuters) - The Airbus A400M had an engine problem on its maiden flight last month, German magazine Spiegel said in an article on Saturday, citing documents from engine maker Europrop. 

 The magazine said documents showed a steering computer and a backup system failed after 30 minutes of flight, causing the engine to be automatically disengaged. An Airbus spokeswoman quoted in the article said the problem has since been fixed. The A400M's maiden flight on December 11 was two years behind schedule following delays in engine development and other snags that manufacturers blame partly on political interference.
