 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The White House declined on Sunday to comment on the latest developments involving Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc, but said U.S. President George W. Bush in general keeps in close touch with key officials on pressing financial matters. 

 "The president and his staff stay in close and frequent contact with Treasury Secretary (Henry) Paulson and other senior economic officials on all pressing financial market issues," said White House spokesman Tony Fratto. He declined further comment as talks to sell Lehman Brothers appeared to be faltering. (Reporting by  Jeremy Pelofsky , Editing by Andre Grenon)
