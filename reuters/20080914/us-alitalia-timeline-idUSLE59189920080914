 (Reuters) - Italian airline Alitalia AZPIa.MI says it might have to cancel flights from Monday as it faces the threat of liquidation and is having difficulty securing fuel supplies. 

 Ministers, unions and investors sought on Sunday to avert liquidation by salvaging a rescue plan which employees have so far rejected. The plan is the latest in a string of attempts to secure a viable future for the ailing carrier. Below is a timeline of Alitalia's troubled sale process: DECEMBER 2006 -- INITIAL AUCTION The centre-left government of Romano Prodi announces it is putting its 49.9 percent Alitalia stake up for sale. The state seeks bids for at least 39.9 percent of the carrier, which would automatically trigger a full bid under Italian takeover law. There are 11 bidders initially but the auction collapses in July 2007 as they gradually pull out, with small Italian carrier Air One the last to do so. DECEMBER 2007 -- SECOND TRY Alitalia draws up list of six potential partners. Franco-Dutch carrier Air France-KLM ( AIRF.PA ) and Air One put in non-binding bids. Government ignores lobbying by unions and regional politicians to pick Air France-KLM for exclusive talks. The two airlines agree on takeover that values Alitalia shares at 10 euro cents, or $184 million, an 81 percent discount to the price they are trading at the time. Criticism from the then leader of the opposition Silvio Berlusconi during the election campaign, plus a lawsuit by Milan's airport operator, puts the deal at risk and it ultimately falls apart over union opposition. APRIL 2008 - THIRD TIME NOT SO LUCKY Returning to office as prime minister after winning an April election, Berlusconi launches a third attempt to secure Alitalia's future, promising to find a group of Italian investors to buy it. Normal disclosure requirements on the sale progress are waived and Alitalia shares are suspended indefinitely in June. His new centre-right government asks bank Intesa Sanpaolo ( ISP.MI ) to draw up a plan, which eventually has Alitalia seeking bankruptcy protection under a new process for "public service" companies on August 29. Berlusconi's cabinet suspends antitrust laws and overhauls a bankruptcy law to accommodate the rescue. It hires a special administrator to sell assets to a single buyer of his choice rather than the highest bigger. An investor group led by Roberto Colaninno called Compagnia Aerea Italiana (CAI) on September 3 submits an offer for parts of Alitalia to create a smaller airline with the help of Air One. The plan's success is dependent on union approval and a partnership with a foreign airline and the administrator gives unions until September 11 to accept the plan, warning he will liquidate the airline if they refuse. The would-be buyers suspend the takeover on September 12 in the face of union opposition, halting due diligence. Alitalia says it may have to ground flights from September 15 as it cannot secure fuel from wary suppliers and Italy's aviation authority says that puts its operating license at risk. Emergency talks are held to seek a last-minute deal. (Writing by  Deepa Babington  and  Marie-Louise Gumuchian )
