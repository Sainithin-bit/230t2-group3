 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Pizza sales are not the same any more for Tony Genovese. 

 The owner of the nearly 20-year-old Italian restaurant Bella Napoli, near Lehman Brothers' LEH.N Manhattan headquarters, lamented the bank's escalating troubles on Friday and fretted about how it affected his own business. "Earlier, they called us for 30 pies, 75 pies sometimes," Genovese said. "They don't call us no more." Genovese is one of many vendors worried as the effect of the firm's misfortunes ripples through the neighborhood near Times Square. The U.S. investment bank was until recently the fourth largest bank in the United States, but growing losses from its exposure to the country's mortgage crisis has the 158-year-old company scrambling to find a willing buyer. Since Monday, the firm's market capitalization has lost 78 percent, to about $2.5 billion from $11.2 billion. Even staffers who have managed to cling to their jobs after hundreds of layoffs are now worried about their future, said Joseph Jacobino, director of marketing and sales at the nearby Tonic Restaurant & Bar. "People are nervous about the company," he said. "Lehman guys, in suits and ties, all nervous ... they come here and drink. They come out to commiserate with each other." Jacobino is not banking on Lehman for business anymore after they abruptly stopped organizing corporate events at the bar earlier this year to cut costs. "We have to deal with it," he said. "We go out and seek companies that are doing better, like law firms." Bartender Alison Ryan also said she worried about what the layoffs could mean in the long run. Such concerns reflect broader anxiety in New York City as thousands of Wall Street jobs are axed and hefty annual bonuses get slashed this year. Wall Street's compensation amounts to almost 35 percent of all salaries and wages earned in the city. "I FEEL BAD FOR THOSE GUYS" So far, Lehman has failed to attract investors to shore up its capital position, weakened this year by its outsized exposure to commercial real estate and residential mortgage assets hit hard by the persisting credit crunch. Bank of America Corp ( BAC.N ) is widely seen as the leading contender to buy the bank, with British bank Barclays Plc ( BARC.L ) also considered a possibility. But a deal is far from certain due to U.S. government reluctance to provide financial backing. Hany Besha, who has run a coffee and bagel cart near the Lehman building for nearly 10 years, said business has dropped 50 percent since Lehman's troubles started. "They are here today and gone tomorrow," he said of Lehman's employees. Outside a nearby building, a shoe shiner said some Lehman staffers come to him during lunch and he fears business will slow. "I feel bad for those guys," he said. But some, like Elizabeth Willis, are unfazed. Willis has run a newspaper stand outside the building for about 40 years and says she is unperturbed by the avalanche of bad news about the bank, which moved there after the September 11, 2001 attacks severely damaged its headquarters near the World Trade Center. "I was here before this was here," Willis said. "I've seen everything. I survived before they came and I will survive after they go away." (Editing by  Andre Grenon )
