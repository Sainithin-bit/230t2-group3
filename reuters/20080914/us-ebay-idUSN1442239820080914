 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. online auctioneer eBay Inc may cut 1,500 jobs, according to an article in Barron's weekly, citing a report published last week by investment-research firm Wedge Partners. 

 The Wedge report, according to Barron's, said eBay's business was "deteriorating" and the company was readying layoffs that could affect 10 percent of its 15,000 employees. Wedge Partners and eBay could not immediately be reached for comment. (Reporting by  Martinne Geller ; Editing by  Ted Kerr )
