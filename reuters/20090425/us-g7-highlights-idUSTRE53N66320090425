 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The following are quotes from finance officials on Friday gathered in Washington for the Group of Seven and Group of 20 meetings: 

 CANADIAN FINANCE MINISTER JIM FLAHERTY: ON U.S. BANKS' TOXIC ASSETS "I expect to hear that the aggregate result of the stress testing in the United States is relatively good. I also expect to hear that there are certain institutions that did not stress test well and that if they are to continue will require further capital." "I expect that there will be proposals put forward by the Americans about how that additional capital would be provided so those institutions can carry on." "I understand there were meetings here in Washington yesterday (between U.S. Treasury and banks) ... that's what I'm told." ON PACE OF BANK STABILIZATION "Yes, it is frustrating." "I'm not being critical because this is uncharted territory." "The banking problems are in the United States and Europe. These are G7 problems and they need to be fixed by the G7 countries involved." "Once the Americans do their cleansing of their system and reinforcement of their system, we need it done also in Europe." ON GERMAN BAD BANK PROPOSAL: "Good news. I'm glad to hear that they're acting. Some of the banks were very highly leveraged. This is a recognition of reality." "I think we've moved into a stabilization phase with implementation of reform steps to make the banks work." ON CHINA SDR FX PROPOSAL: "Yes I expect these issues will be touched on because various countries will raise various issues in which they have a particular interest." ON FUTURE OF G7 AND G20: "I expect there'll be some discussion here about the future of G7 G20, G8, the international organizations." "There's a value to what the G7 can do when it focuses just given its size. The emerging countries have to participate. It doesn't make sense anymore when half the economic power in the world is in other economies." "The problem with going to the G20 as a constant is that G21 will be unhappy ... The G20 has good discussions but its difficult to have the kind of focused intense discussions that one can have in the G7." RUSSIAN FINANCE MINISTER ALEXEI KUDRIN ON IMF, WORLD BANK: "The role of emerging nations in the IMF and the World Bank should be increased." BRAZIL CENTRAL BANK PRESIDENT HENRIQUE MEIRELLES ON BRAZIL'S ECONOMY: "Week after week analysts are lowering their estimates for Brazil's growth in 2009 but they are not reducing accordingly their inflation forecast. I think that something is intriguing in those forecasts. People are very careful." "Forecasts for the Brazilian economy are still worsening. But most likely we are going to get out the crisis stronger than we entered because we will be not building imbalances. "Evidently the primary surplus is coming down. But at the end of the day the debt/gdp ratio will get out of this process still below the number we were when we came in."
