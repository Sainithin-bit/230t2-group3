 (Reuters) - Boeing Co has "extreme confidence" in the 787 Dreamliner passenger jet, despite a series of mechanical incidents in recent days and weeks, the plane's chief project engineer said on Wednesday. 
 On a conference call, Boeing Vice President Mike Sinnett said the performance of the 787 was largely similar to the earlier 777 model in that plane's first year of service. (Reporting By  Ben Berkowitz ; Editing by Maureen Bavdek)
