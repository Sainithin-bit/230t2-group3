 LONDON  (Reuters) - The head of UBS's investment bank told a UK parliamentary committee on Wednesday that the bank was still at risk of future scandals despite the changes it has implemented in the aftermath of the Libor rate-rigging controversy. 
 "I would love to tell you it won't happen again, but I can't tell you it won't happen again," Andrea Orcel said. (Reporting by Carmel Crimmins; Editing by Greg Mahlich)
