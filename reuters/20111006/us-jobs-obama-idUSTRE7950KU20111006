 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - President Barack Obama on Wednesday remembered Apple Inc co-founder Steve Jobs as a visionary and great American innovator. 

 Jobs died on Wednesday at the age of 56 after a long battle with pancreatic cancer. His death was announced by Apple. "Steve was among the greatest of American innovators - brave enough to think differently, bold enough to believe he could change the world, and talented enough to do it," Obama said in a statement. "The world has lost a visionary. And there may be no greater tribute to Steve's success than the fact that much of the world learned of his passing on a device he invented," Obama said.
