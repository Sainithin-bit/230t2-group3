 (Reuters) - AstraZeneca Plc ( AZN.L ) said on Thursday it will cut about 400 jobs from its U.S. commercial business as Britain's second-largest drugmaker seeks to reduce costs. 

 The cuts will hit the company's U.S. headquarters in Wilmington, Delaware, as well as some field-based, non-sales positions, AstraZeneca said. About 70 of the jobs facing elimination are currently vacant. The London-based company faces a challenge to drive growth beyond 2016, when more patents will expire on drugs such as cholesterol fighter Crestor and anti-psychotic Seroquel XR. "This will be very difficult for our entire organization, particularly the people who are directly impacted," AstraZeneca U.S. President Rich Fante said in a statement. "However, these changes are necessary to build a leaner, more efficient organization that will enable the company to continue delivering against our mission of patient health and sustaining a strong business for years to come." AstraZeneca workers could volunteer to leave the company and all the decisions will be finalized by early December, the company said.
