 (Reuters) - Boeing Co ( BA.N ) on Thursday said it delivered 127 commercial airplanes in the third quarter including 100 of its best-selling 737 narrowbodies and 21 widebody 777s. 

 The number of deliveries, which include the first 787 Dreamliner, were up slightly from the 124 reported for the year-ago quarter. Boeing, the world's second-largest commercial airplane maker after EADS ( EAD.PA ) unit Airbus, gets paid for airplanes at delivery. The company is due to report third-quarter financial results on October 26. In its weekly order book update, Boeing said it took a new order for one 777 from an unidentified customer. On Wednesday, Boeing said Ethiopian airlines had ordered four Boeing 777 Freighters, with a list value of about $1.1 billion.
