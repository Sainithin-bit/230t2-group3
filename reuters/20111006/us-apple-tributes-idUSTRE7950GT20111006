 (Reuters) - President Barack Obama was among the many people who paid tribute to Steve Jobs, calling the Apple co-founder a visionary and great American innovator. 

 "Steve was among the greatest of American innovators -- brave enough to think differently, bold enough to believe he could change the world, and talented enough to do it," Obama said of Jobs, who died on Wednesday. "The world has lost a visionary. And there may be no greater tribute to Steve's success than the fact that much of the world learned of his passing on a device he invented." The president was joined by political, technology, entertainment and business leaders around the world in paying tribute to Jobs. A selection: BILL GATES, MICROSOFT CO-FOUNDER AND CHAIRMAN "Steve and I first met nearly 30 years ago, and have been colleagues, competitors and friends over the course of more than half our lives.

For those of us lucky enough to get to work with him, it's been an insanely great honor." STEPHEN ELOP, NOKIA CEO "The world lost a true visionary today. Steve's passion for simplicity and elegance leaves us all a legacy that will endure for generations. Today, my thoughts, and those of everyone at Nokia, are with the friends and family that he leaves behind." FRENCH PRESIDENT NICOLAS SARKOZY ON FACEBOOK "His capacity to revolutionize entire sectors of the economy by the power of imagination and technology is a source of inspiration for millions of engineers and entrepreneurs across the world.
