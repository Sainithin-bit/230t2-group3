 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Warren Buffett on Wednesday said he has not seen any attractive investments in the struggling financial services industry, but left open the possibility that this could change by the middle of next year. 

 "We haven't seen any (investments) we want to move on. That doesn't mean we won't in the next six months," said Buffett, the chairman of Berkshire Hathaway Inc ( BRKa.N ) ( BRKb.N ), in an interview on CNBC television. "It's certainly possible a number of the big banks are not going to hit their highs on earnings for a few years." Buffett made his comments after several financial companies -- including Citigroup Inc ( C.N ), Merrill Lynch & Co MER.N, Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ) and UBS AG ( UBSN.VX ) -- had this quarter announced multibillion dollar capital injections from foreign investors. On Tuesday, Berkshire agreed to pay the Pritzker family of Chicago $4.5 billion for a 60 percent stake in Marmon Holdings Inc, a maker of such products as railroad tank cars and plumbing pipes. Berkshire agreed to buy the rest of Marmon over the next five to six years. (Reporting by Jonathan Stempel; Editing by  Derek Caney )
