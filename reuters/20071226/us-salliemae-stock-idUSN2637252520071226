 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Sallie Mae said on Wednesday that it plans to sell about $2.5 billion of stock and mandatory convertible securities to help pay off obligations linked to the student loan company's share buyback program. 

 The deal will boost the number of outstanding Sallie Mae shares, and the company's stock fell 6.46 percent in aftermarket trading from Wednesday's close of $22.13. But the deal will also resolve a significant concern surrounding the company, namely how it would pay off its roughly $2 billion of obligations under equity forward contracts it used for its share buyback program for a decade. The equity forward contracts allowed the student lender to buy back shares at a cheaper cost if its shares kept rising, but forced the company to buy back shares at a higher cost if they fell. Sallie Mae, legally known as SLM Corp SLM.N said it expects to use about $2 billion of the proceeds from the equity sales to settle equity forward contracts. Sallie Mae said last week that it and its banks had transferred a series of its equity forward contracts to Citigroup ( C.N ), in a move that signaled to many investors that the company was close to raising capital to settle the equity forwards.
