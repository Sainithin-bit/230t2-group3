 (Reuters) - Capital Bank Corp CBKN.O said it is writing down certain assets estimated to worth $2.6 million to $2.8 million. 

 Capital Bank also plans to take reorganization charges of about $1.3 million to $1.4 million related to certain projects. "While Capital Bank has no subprime mortgage exposure, the current housing market is soft throughout the franchise, thereby causing difficulty in the liquidation process of certain nonperforming loans on our balance sheet," Chief Credit Officer Mark Redmond said in a statement.
