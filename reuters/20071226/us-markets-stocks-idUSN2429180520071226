 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. stocks were little changed on Wednesday after Target Inc ( TGT.N ) cut its sales forecast and depressed retail shares, offsetting gains in major energy companies as oil hit a one-month high. 

 Sales at online retailers proved stronger than those at traditional stores, with Amazon.com Inc. ( AMZN.O ) shares rising and helping boost the Nasdaq. Amazon said the 2007 holiday season was its strongest yet.  However, Target warned its December same-store sales would fall short of expectations, fueling concerns about some retailers' sales this holiday shopping season. The S&P retail index .RLX fell 1.2 percent. "It's a quiet day, with a lot of people still out. Retail is what it is: People have expected the numbers we've gotten," said Victor Pugliese, director of listed equity trading at Broadpoint Securities in New York. "Oil is up, and the question is: 'Are we going back up to $100?'" Trading volume was light following the Christmas holiday while major markets in Europe remained closed. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  was up 2.36 points, or 0.02 percent, to end at 13,551.69. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  was up 1.21 points, or 0.08 percent, at 1,497.66. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  was up 10.91 points, or 0.40 percent, at 2,724.41. Shares of Exxon Mobil Corp ( XOM.N ) rose 1.2 percent to $94.81 after U.S. crude oil futures hit their highest level since November after another Turkish raid on northern Iraq. Exxon topped the list of the Dow's major advancers. Amazon.com shares gained 2 percent to $92.85 and were among the Nasdaq's top advancers. Google led the Nasdaq, rising 1.4 percent to $710.84. Target's shares fell 2.5 percent to $51.16. After Monday's closing bell, the discount retailer said it expects sales at stores open at least a year to be in the range of down about 1 percent to up 1 percent, adjusted for the calendar shift. Previously, Target had forecast that December same-store sales would rise 3 percent to 5 percent on a calendar-adjusted basis. Macy's ( M.N ) was down 3.9 percent at $25.95 and Wal-Mart Stores Inc ( WMT.N ) was down 0.7 percent at $48.38. Analysts and policy-makers have been closely monitoring the U.S. consumer for signs of flagging spending, which could send the economy into a recession. Early in the day, the Standard & Poor's/Case-Shiller index showed prices of existing U.S. single-family homes recorded their biggest annual drop in October. But the Dow Jones U.S. Home Construction Index .DJUSHB ended up 0.2 percent. Trading was well below average on the New York Stock Exchange, with about 839 million shares changing hands compared with last year's estimated daily average of 1.84 billion. On Nasdaq, about 1.26 billion shares traded, below last year's daily average of 2.02 billion. Declining stocks were about even with advancing ones on the NYSE, while advancers outpaced decliners by a ratio of about 17 to 13 on Nasdaq. (Editing by  Jan Paschal )
