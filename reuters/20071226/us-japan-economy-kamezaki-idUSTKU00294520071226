 YOKOHAMA, Japan  (Reuters) - Uncertainty in the global economic outlook is rising and central banks need to be careful at such a time, Bank of Japan Policy Board member Hidetoshi Kamezaki said on Wednesday. 

 "At the moment, uncertainty in the global economic outlook is rising, centering on the U.S. economy," Kamezaki told business leaders in Yokohama, near Tokyo. Kamezaki, a former trading house executive, has voted consistently with the majority not to raise rates since joining the board in April. He has been considered a policy hawk, however, after saying in a newspaper interview in June that the bank should take action promptly once it confirms that growth is set to continue.
