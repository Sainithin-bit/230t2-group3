 (Reuters) - Ultralife Batteries Inc ( ULBI.O ) said it received a follow-on order of about $40 million to supply advanced communications systems and expects 2008 revenue to reach at least $230 million. 

 The order was a follow-on to the $62 million order the company announced on December 17, Ultralife said in a statement. Deliveries for the order from a U.S. defense contractor will be made in 2008, it added. (Reporting by Anant Vijay Kala in Bangalore; Editing by Amitha Rajan)
