 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Phone company Qwest Communications International Inc ( Q.N ) said on Monday its full-year results will likely be toward the lower end of its forecasts due to a weaker economy and competition. 

 The remarks by Chief Executive Edward Mueller confirmed investors' worries about Qwest's vulnerability to the growing popularity of mobile phones and cable service providers' voice services. Its shares fell 3.83 percent to $4.52. Mueller told a Deutsche Bank conference that he expected revenue and adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization), to be at lower end of Qwest's previous forecasts. "In the marketplace there's a lot of head-wind, as you know, from the housing downturn, the financial woes of our country right now," the CEO said, adding that it was losing traditional phone customers as they switched to mobile phones or cable services. He added, however, that the company's adjusted free cash flow outlook for 2008 was unchanged. In February, Qwest forecast 2008 revenue to be "flat to slightly down" from 2007, and adjusted EBITDA to be flat to up 2 percent. Denver, Colorado-based Qwest, with a vastly rural territory and without a wireless unit, is seen as one of the weakest of the former Bell operating companies. It is also seen particularly vulnerable to competition from cable operators, which have in recent years been selling voice services bundled with Internet and television. Industry leaders AT&T Inc ( T.N ) and Verizon Communications Inc ( VZ.N ) have been investing heavily in new video services to compete with cable, but Qwest has been wary of large investment projects, focusing mainly on trimming costs and paring debt. Many have said the company is a likely candidate for a merger or acquisition. Mueller said he sees more consolidation ahead for the telecommunications industry, and that his company is open to deals beneficial to shareholders. "I think time will tell how this works out, but there's probably some consolidation out there yet to be had," Mueller said. While declining to comment on specific deals, such as suggestions that it merge with fellow U.S. phone carrier Embarq Corp EQ.N, Mueller said the company would pursue anything that would be "accretive for shareholders."
