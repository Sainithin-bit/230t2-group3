 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japan's Shin-Etsu Chemical Co Ltd ( 4063.T ) sees no signs of recovery in the U.S. housing market and is looking to emerging markets for growth, the president of the chemical maker said on Monday. Shin-Etsu is the world's largest maker of polyvinyl chloride (PVC), a resin used in pipes, wires and other construction materials. It was hit hard by the U.S. housing slump. 

 "I see absolutely no signs of recovery in the U.S.," President Chihiro Kanagawa told reporters. "Growth is coming from other parts of the globe, such as the Middle East, southeast Asia and the Caribbean." Shin-Etsu unit Shintech Inc., which holds a 30 percent share of the U.S. PVC market, posted a 19.1 percent decline in net profit in calendar 2007 to $202 million. About 60 to 70 percent of Shin-Etsu's PVC business comes from construction materials. Rival PVC makers, including Georgia Gulf GGC.N, PolyOne Corp ( POL.N ) and Westlake Chemical Corp ( WLK.N ), have also been hit by the housing slump. Shin-Etsu, which is also the world's largest maker of silicon wafers used in semi-conductors, is aiming for flat earnings from its PVC business this year, even as it plans to bring onstream a new Louisiana plant that could lower PVC prices further. "The timing of the plant could have been better," Kanagawa said. "But demand from abroad will mean full utilization of our plants." He added that the Japanese PVC market was even worse than the U.S. market, and that consolidation was unlikely to help. "The Japanese market is near death," he said. "Uniting two loss-making operations does not eliminate losses, nor is reducing the scale of operations likely to help much. Sometimes the best thing to do is hold tight and wait." Shares of Shin-Etsu ended down 3.6 percent at 6,670 yen, against a fall of 2.1 percent in the benchmark Nikkei average  <.N 225>. (Reporting by  Mayumi Negishi , editing by Brent Kininmont)
