 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - In the wake of the financial crisis that led to the failure of investment bank Bear Stearns and a decision by the Federal Reserve to open its emergency lending to primary dealers, Fed officials have spoken about the need for changes to oversight of the financial system. 

 Following are some of their comments: NEW YORK FED PRESIDENT TIM GEITHNER, June 9: "We have to increase the shock absorbers held in normal times against bad macroeconomic and financial outcomes. This will require more exacting expectations on capital, liquidity and risk management for the largest institutions that play a central role in intermediation and market functioning. They should be set high enough to offset the benefits that come from access to central bank liquidity, but not so high that they succeed only in pushing more capital to the unregulated part of the financial system. ... The institutions that play a central role in money and funding markets -- including the main globally active banks and investment banks -- need to operate under a unified framework that provides a strong form of consolidated supervision, with appropriate requirements for capital and liquidity. To complement this, we need to put in place a stronger framework of oversight authority over the critical parts of the payments system -- not just the established payments, clearing and settlements systems, but the infrastructure that underpins the decentralized over-the-counter markets... The Federal Reserve should play a central role in such a framework, working closely with supervisors in the U.S. and in other countries." VICE CHAIRMAN DONALD KOHN, June 5: "The existence of liquidity facilities at the central bank can undermine normal incentives for maintaining liquidity buffers, and the more extensive the access, the greater the degree to which market discipline will be loosened and prudential regulation will need to be tightened. Unquestionably, regulation needs to respond to what we have learned about the importance of primary dealers and their vulnerabilities to liquidity pressures." RICHMOND FED PRESIDENT JEFFREY LACKER, June 5: "The danger is that the effect of recent credit extension on the incentives of financial market participants might induce greater risk taking, which in turn could give rise to more frequent crises, in which case it might be difficult to resist further expanding the scope of central bank lending." "Our supervisory oversight and ability to constrain institutions that could put us in that situation needs to be better aligned. If an institution can put us in that position, we need to be able to prevent them from doing so little to ensure against such an outcome." "A broader question is just what are the new boundaries. And I think establishing that in a clear and credible way is another major challenge that we have before us." "Given what has happened, we need to have responsibility and authority that is better aligned with the scope of lending that we are going to be called upon to do." PHILADELPHIA FED PRESIDENT CHARLES PLOSSER, JUNE 5: "Policy interventions in financial markets run the risks of increasing moral hazard and inhibiting efficient price discovery." "Moreover, interventions intended to quell instability can, by creating moral hazard, actually make instability more severe in the long run." "Specifying in advance the conditions or states of the world under which the central bank will lend is an essential first step." CHAIRMAN BEN BERNANKE, June 3: "We are taking action in our role as regulators. We have worked with lenders and servicers to encourage appropriate modifications of distressed mortgage loans, and we have proposed new rules to improve disclosure and to ban unfair or deceptive acts and practices in mortgage lending. We are also collaborating with other regulators, both domestically and abroad, to put in place changes that will help make the financial system less vulnerable in the future. Among the changes we expect to see are strengthening of capital and liquidity rules, greater disclosure requirements, an increased emphasis on the measurement and management of firm-wide risks, and further steps to increase the transparency and resilience of the financial infrastructure. Our goal is to emerge from this difficult period with a financial system that will be more stable without being less innovative, with a more effective balance between market discipline and regulation."
