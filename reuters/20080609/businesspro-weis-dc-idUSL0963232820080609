 LONDON  (Reuters) - Property developer Weis Development Corp 
announced plans to list on London's junior AIM market by next 
month, luring potential investors as a turnaround expert in 
U.S. properties bombed-out by the global credit crunch. 

  Maryland, U.S.-based Weis said it plans to acquire 
financially distressed U.S. residential projects, some of which 
are at discounts of as much as 70 percent to book value, for 
repositioning and development once the market returns to 
normality.  "Certain sub-markets of the US housing market are nearing 
the nadir of their recent decline ... creating the opportunity 
to acquire significantly discounted land (and) infrastructure," 
the company said.  Its initial acquisition focus is on high-quality, 
large-scale residential real estate developments being sold by 
banks and troubled developers that are experiencing financial 
distress as a result of the effects of the credit crunch on 
property sales, it said.  Weis, run by distressed property experts Adam Weis and 
Andrew Adler, says it is a turnaround operator, not a 'vulture 
fund'.  The two executive directors are investing $5 million of 
their money in the exercise, which is expected to raise $151 
million.  (Reporting by Hsu Chuang Khoo; Editing by Quentin Bryar)
