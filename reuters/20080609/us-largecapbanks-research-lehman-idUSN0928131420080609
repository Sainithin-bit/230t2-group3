 BANGALORE, India  (Reuters) - Shares of large U.S. banks and thrifts suffered broad declines on Monday after analysts warned that the global credit crisis will cause loan losses in the sector to mount. 

 Lehman Brothers Inc analyst Jason Goldberg said the largest U.S. banks could post $79 billion of credit losses this year, 30 percent more than he had previously forecast and more than twice the year-earlier level, with many of the problems stemming from real estate. While regulators have tried to boost market liquidity, Goldberg wrote that "we expect elevated loan losses and further loan loss reserve building to continue to weigh on near-term results." Goldberg cut his 2008 earnings forecasts for more than 20 banking companies and lowered his price target for most of these, including the five largest: Citigroup Inc, Bank of America Corp, JPMorgan Chase & Co, Wachovia Corp and Wells Fargo & Co. Meanwhile, Washington Mutual Inc shares fell to a 16-year low after UBS AG analyst Eric Wasserstrom predicted the largest U.S. savings and loan could face $27 billion of losses in all asset classes through 2011. He widened his full-year loss estimate for the thrift to $4.45 per share from $4, and cut his price target to $8.50 per share from $11. Fears the credit crisis has much further to run were fanned when Lehman itself projected a $2.77 billion second-quarter loss, more than 10 times what analysts on average expected. This led Wall Street's smallest major investment bank following the collapse of Bear Stearns Cos to bolster its capital base by raising $6 billion in securities offerings. PAIN SPREADS Banks have been battered by mounting loan losses as the slumping economy, skidding housing markets, record oil prices, rising unemployment and tighter credit conditions make it harder for borrowers to stay current on their debts. Exposure to subprime mortgage debt and structured finance products have already resulted in more than $400 billion of write-downs and credit losses industrywide since the middle of last year. But credit problems once concentrated in lower-quality, subprime mortgages have spread into higher-quality loans. The weakness has already begun to filter into other kinds of borrowings, including credit cards and auto debt, as well as loans to commercial real estate developers. "The subprime error will go down as one of the biggest mistakes ever," said Greg Peters, head of global credit strategy at Morgan Stanley, at the Reuters Investment Outlook Summit. "What we haven't even seen yet is the regional bank problem coming home to roost." Lehman's Goldberg said card losses were rising mainly in states with highly troubled housing markets, including California, Florida, Ohio and Arizona. Late on Monday afternoon, the KBW Bank Index .BKX> was down 4 percent, compared with a 0.3 percent drop in the Standard & Poor's 500 index .SPX>. Among the KBW index's largest percentage decliners were JPMorgan, Wachovia, Regions Financial Corp and Washington Mutual. The KBW index had been down 21.4 percent this year through Friday.
