 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A plan to sell the Wrigley Field ballpark in Chicago to an Illinois state authority failed to make progress after the state group said it could not agree to terms set by Tribune Co, the field's owner. 

 In a statement released on Monday after the two sides met, the Illinois Sports Facilities Authority (ISFA) said Tribune believes that the authority's acquisition would require the transfer of future sales and amusement tax revenue from transactions at Wrigley Field for the next 30 years, imposing new taxes or the transfer of funds pledged to projects at U.S. Cellular Field. "ISFA cannot agree to this," said the group's chairman, former Illinois Gov. James Thompson. Wrigley Field is the home of the Chicago Cubs baseball team, which Tribune is trying to sell. U.S. Cellular Field is the home of the Chicago White Sox baseball team. A Tribune spokesman was not immediately available for comment. (Reporting by  Robert MacMillan )
