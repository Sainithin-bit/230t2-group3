 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - David Glaser, a confidant former Bear 
Stearns chief executive Alan Schwartz, has joined Bank of 
America, the New York Times reported on Monday, the latest 
executive to turn away from JPMorgan as it tries to keep top 
Bear talent from bailing on the merged bank. 

  Glaser was co-head of investment banking at Bear Stearns & 
Co. He will become chairman of Bank of America's ( BAC.N ) global 
mergers and acquisitions practice, the Times reported.  Glaser spent 23 years at Bear, the Times said, adding that 
the number of Bear bankers at Bank of America shows it is 
beefing up its own investment banking franchise.  JPMorgan & Chase Co ( JPM.N ) Chief Executive Jamie Dimon has 
been trying hard to keep top talent from jumping ship, but has 
not necessarily offered jobs to all of the top executives 
popping up elsewhere on Wall Street, the Times said.  Last week, subprime mortgage company Accredited Home 
Lenders ( AHHAP.PK ) named Jeff Walton, previously Bear's head of 
mortgage origination lending, as its chief executive.  Accredited Home's parent, private equity firm Lone Star 
Funds, last month bought "certain operating assets" of the 
business Walton used to head up, Bear Stearns Residential 
Mortgage Corp.  Bear Stearns was forced in March to ask JPMorgan to acquire 
it at the rock-bottom price of $10 a share.  (Reporting by Christopher Kaufman)
