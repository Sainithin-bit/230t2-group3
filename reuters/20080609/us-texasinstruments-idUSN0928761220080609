 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Texas Instruments Inc TXN.N on Monday narrowed a quarterly earnings and revenue target range it issued in April because of caution among its chip customers and weak demand for high-end phones. 

 TI, which makes chips used in everything from cell phones to industrial equipment, forecast second-quarter earnings of 43 cents to 47 cents per share on revenue of $3.33 billion to $3.46 billion. "There are a couple of areas where we are seeing weakness, one of which is wireless handset revenue, which continues to be unseasonably weak and we would expect that it's probably going to be down a little bit from the first quarter level," said TI's head of investor relations Ron Slaymaker on a brief conference call with analysts to discuss the update. "Another area (of weakness) would be processors, which are running weak for the quarter," Slaymaker said. At the same time, TI is seeing growth in its analog chip business, which Slaymaker said would grow both sequentially and year over year. Certain types of digital signal processors and microcontrollers also are seeing similar positive growth. Shares of the company declined less than 1 percent in extended trade on Monday to $31.15. In regular trade, the stock added 9 cents to close at $31.33 on the New York Stock Exchange. On April 21, TI disappointed investors with a forecast for earnings of 42 cents to 48 cents per share on revenue of $3.24 billion to $3.5 billion. Before the mid-quarter update, analysts had, on average, expected net earnings of 46 cents per share on revenue of $3.38 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. In April, the company said that while its guidance for the current second quarter was conservative across the board, it also noted that demand for third-generation phones with fast Web links in particular would grow more slowly than anticipated. The Dallas-based company said on Monday it expected semiconductor revenue in the quarter of $3.17 billion to $3.28 billion, compared with the previous forecast of $3.08 billion to $3.32 billion. Shares of TI, which earns 35 percent of its revenue from phone chips and about 40 percent from analog chips used in many electronics products, have rebounded by about 8 percent since April as investors bet analog demand was holding up.
