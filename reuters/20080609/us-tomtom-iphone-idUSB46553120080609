 AMSTERDAM  (Reuters) - Dutch navigation device maker TomTom already has a version of its navigation software running on Apple's iPhone and has plans to sell it to consumers, a spokesman said on Monday. 

 "Our navigation system runs on the iPhone already," the TomTom spokesman said after Apple announced a new version of the iPhone that will include global positioning (GPS) capability. The spokesman did not say when TomTom, Europe's biggest maker of car navigation devices, would be ready to start selling the software. (Reporting by  Niclas Mika ; editing by Carol Bishopric)
