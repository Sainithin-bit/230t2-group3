 LONDON  (Reuters) - Thomas Cook, Europe's second-largest travel firm, said it had bought up businesses in France and Canada on Monday for a combined $222 million, extending its recent acquisition spree. 

 The company has agreed to buy French operator Jet Tours from Club Mediterranee SA for 70 million euros ($110 million), subject to works council consultation and regulatory approval. It also announced the acquisition of TriWest Travel Holdings (TTH), a travel wholesaler in Canada, subject to regulatory approval, for a maximum of 114 million Canadian dollars ($112 million). Thomas Cook has pursued an aggressive acquisition strategy since its creation last year following the merger of Arcandor's travel unit and UK company MyTravel, looking to utilize its combined strength in the highly competitive but fragmented tour operating industry. It recently spent 250 million euros on a string of acquisitions in India and the Middle East and is in talks regarding possible deals in the rapidly-growing Russian market. Paris-based Jet Tours, whose brands also include Club Eldorador and Austral Lagons, is a premium tour operator which serves about 270,000 customers each year. Last year, it had revenues of 313.7 million euros and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of 3.4 million euros. Thomas Cook said the business is expected to significantly expand sales in the current year and achieve EBITDA of more than 8 million euros. The combination of Jet Tours and Thomas Cook France will form the country's third largest tour operator, with a joint market share of about 10 percent. Thomas Cook said it expects to realize substantial synergies from the integration of the two businesses. It will also explore strategic flying partnership opportunities and look to sell Club Med products through Thomas Cook travel agencies. TTH, which focuses on commission-based travel business across the Canadian market, achieved revenues of 171.7 million Canadian dollars last year and EBITDA of 14.4 million dollars. Thomas Cook also sees substantial synergies to be achieved from the integration of TTH and Thomas Cook North America. At 4:30 a.m. EDT, shares in Thomas Cook were up 0.5 percent at 234.75 pence. JP Morgan reiterated its 'overweight' recommendation. It expects the deals to be "modestly" earnings enhancing in the first year after acquisition but cautioned that the group is gaining greater exposure to two competitive markets, thereby raising its risk profile. In particular, JP Morgan questioned the Canadian deal, describing the move as "somewhat surprising", given the very competitive nature of the Canadian market. Shares in Thomas Cook have outperformed the FTSE All Share Travel & Leisure Index by 2.5 percent since the start of the year as bookings remained strong despite worries over an economic slowdown. Tour operators have emphasized the resilience of the package holiday industry, arguing that consumers are reluctant to sacrifice their holidays even when household budgets are tight.
