 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc is not talking to sovereign wealth funds or other investors now to raise more capital, after having raised $6 billion on Monday, the company's chief financial officer told Reuters. 

 "We raised a boatload of capital today. We've got to get down to performing now ... That's where our emphasis is going to be," CFO Erin Callan said. She added: "I'm not saying we wouldn't have a conversation like that, but we don't have a gameplan to do so." Asked about the potential for more layoffs after the company cut 1,900 positions in its fiscal second quarter, Callan said Lehman is "scaled correctly at this point based on what we know the opportunity to be." Separately, the New Jersey Division of Investment said it had bought $120 million of Lehman stock and $60 million of convertible preferred securities in Monday's $6 billion securities offerings.
