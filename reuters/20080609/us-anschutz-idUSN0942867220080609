 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Tax authorities are trying to force billionaire Philip Anschutz to pay $143.6 million in back taxes as part of a broader move against strategies used to defer paying capital-gains taxes, The Wall Street Journal reported on Monday. 

 Anschutz says about $429 million of deals in question from 2000 and 2001 were not completed sales for tax purposes, the Journal said, citing filings in U.S. Tax Court in Washington. As a result he has not paid capital-gains taxes on the transactions, it reports. In February, the agency issued an advisory to its agents declaring that some versions of prepaid forward contracts should trigger immediate taxes, the Journal said. Anschutz's deals involve shares of Union Pacific Corp ( UNP.N ) and Anadarko Petroleum Corp ( APC.N ) that netted him cash, returns on future profit and protection from losses, it said. It said top corporate executives and company founders like prepaid forward contracts because they help limit the risk of holding a sizeable chunk of their personal wealth in their own company's stock. In an arrangement like the one used by Anschutz, the executive agrees to turn over his shares to an investment bank on a specific future date, and loans the bank the same amount of stock in exchange for cash up front, as much as 80 percent of the shares' fair market value, the paper said. An IRS spokesman declined to comment on how many audits it had undertaken of such deals, it said. "The IRS is definitely focused on these types of transactions and I'd anticipate seeing more of these types of cases in the future," Bryan Skarlatos, an attorney at Kostelanetz & Fink LLP in New York who specializes in tax disputes told the Journal.
