 BOSTON  (Reuters) - Symantec Corp ( SYMC.O ), the world's largest maker of security software, has recently laid off an undisclosed number of workers around the globe, a company spokeswoman said on Thursday. 

 "As part of our ongoing focus on managing operational expenses, Symantec has recently implemented some restructuring measures, including a reduction in force," said company spokeswoman Yunsun Wee. "We're not releasing information on the size or the scope." Symantec, which has about 17,000 employees, had laid off some 570 workers in its fiscal third quarter, which ended Dec 31, according to its most-recent quarterly filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company has yet to provide financial data for its fiscal fourth quarter. (Reporting by  Jim Finkle , editing by Gerald E. McCormick)
