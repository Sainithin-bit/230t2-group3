 SEATTLE  (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp said on Wednesday that any definitive agreement between Yahoo Inc and Google Inc would make the market for Web search less competitive. 

 In a statement, Microsoft General Counsel Brad Smith said Yahoo and Google would consolidate over 90 percent of the search advertising market in Google's hands. Smith added that Microsoft was assessing all of its options. His comments responded to Yahoo's announcement earlier on Wednesday that it will carry Web search advertising from Google in a test. Yahoo has rejected Microsoft's unsolicited offer to buy it as insufficient and has been seeking alternatives to a Microsoft takeover. (Reporting by  Daisuke Wakabayashi ; Editing by  Gary Hill )
