 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Limited Brands Inc ( LTD.N ) on Thursday posted an 8 percent decline in March same-store sales, which was deeper than Wall Street expected, but in line with the retailer's outlook. 

 Analysts on average had been expecting a decline of 7.5 percent, according to Reuters Estimates. The operator of the Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works chains said total sales were $733.2 million for the five weeks that ended April 5, down from $892.3 million a year earlier. The timing of the Easter holiday, which was two weeks earlier than a year ago, hurt sales by 3 percentage points, the company said. Sales at stores open at least a year fell 6 percent at Victoria's Secret as weak sales of beauty products and panties offset strong sales of bras. At Bath & Body Works, same-store sales fell a worse-than-expected 13 percent, hurt by a decline in customer traffic. Sales at the La Senza chain fell 4 percent. Limited said it expected same-store sales to decline at a low-single-digit percentage rate in April. (Reporting by  Martinne Geller ; Editing by Maureen Bavdek and Lisa Von Ahn)
