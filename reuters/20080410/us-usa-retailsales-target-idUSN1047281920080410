 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Discount retailer Target Corp ( TGT.N ) on Thursday said sales at stores open at least a year fell a bigger-than-expected 4.4 percent in March. 

 Analysts, on average, were expecting a same-store sales decline of 2.7 percent, according to Reuters Estimates, while the retailer had forecast a fall in a low-single-digit percentage range. Bob Ulrich, chairman and chief executive officer, said in a statement that the company's performance was "modestly below our planned range." The retailer said the timing of Easter, which fell on March 23 this year compared with April 8 a year ago, hurt its March sales but will benefit April results. In a recorded call, Target said it expects April same-store sales to increase in the mid-single-digit percentage range. It also said it expects same-store sales for March and April combined to be near the low end of its forecast range of down 1 percent to up 1 percent. Total retail sales for the five weeks ended April 5 increased 1.5 percent to $5.68 billion. Sales were strong in its health care, household and consumable departments, but weakest in men's apparel, jewelry, and lawn and garden. (Reporting by  Nicole Maestri , editing by Gerald E.
