 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Standard & Poor's President Deven Sharma said Group of Seven finance chiefs will have a "very critical" role in reforming debt rating procedures, but new recommendations from them will not be sufficient to restore financial markets. 

 A report due on Friday from the G7's Financial Stability Forum will recommend numerous steps to improve disclosure and better manage risks to try to avoid a repeat of current global market turmoil. "These proposals and actions by themselves are not going to bring the market back," Sharma said in an interview with Reuters. "Longer run, I think it will give more confidence and help bring the market back." "The crisis is more about liquidity and deleveraging, and these actions do not necessarily address those problems," he said. Sharma was appointed president of S&P, a unit of McGraw-Hill Cos MPH.N, last year after Kathleen Corbet stepped down in the wake of criticism of the three main rating companies over their role in the global credit crisis. Since last year, rating agencies have cut billions of dollars worth of subprime mortgage-related securities. Technical defaults of collateralized debt obligations, tied to the subprime mortgages, now represent about $159 billion in liabilities, according to S&P. "The G7 and FSF will play a very critical and important role in bringing all the different rating groups that all look at the same problem and are looking at different solutions," Sharma said. "The FSF is in the best position to synthesize." Moody's Investors Service Chairman Ray McDaniel and Fitch Ratings President Stephen Joynt declined to comment until the full details of the report were released, spokespersons said. "We appreciate all the work that the FSF and all the policymakers are doing to restore confidence in the market and improve the quality of ratings," said Anthony Mirenda, a Moody's spokesman. "We look forward to continuing that dialogue." Among some new measures that have been discussed are separate rating systems for structured debt at the heart of the credit crisis that has gripped global markets since last year. S&P on Thursday updated its latest efforts to improve its rating process and enhance transparency, a focus of discussions for the FSF. "Conceptually, we are very supportive and very aligned," with those goals, Sharma said. Based on market feedback, S&P is looking at differentiating its ratings of structured products using "separate identifiers," Sharma said, but he did not support an entirely new rating system for those securities. "At this point we are supporting one consistent global scale," he said. The G7 includes the United States, Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan. Finance ministers from the seven industrial nations meet on Friday ahead of semiannual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank over the weekend. (Editing by  Diane Craft )
