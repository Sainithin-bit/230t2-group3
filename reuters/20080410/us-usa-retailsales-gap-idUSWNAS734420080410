 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Gap Inc ( GPS.N ) said on Thursday its sales at stores open at least a year plunged 18 percent in March, hurt by weak sales in its Old Navy women's clothes and lower promotions at its namesake brand. 

 But the company also said tight inventories led to improved margins and it stood by its full-year earnings forecast. Analysts, on average, had been expecting the San Francisco-based clothing retailer to post a same-stores sales decrease of 8 percent, according to Reuters Estimates. Same-store sales fell 27 percent at Old Navy, with the company saying its women's' clothing mix had strayed too far from basics at that brand. "We have put too much emphasis on fashion in our women's assortment," a Gap spokesman said in a recorded message. The company plans to shift the mix to more basic clothes, the spokesman said. Same-store sales fell 14 percent at Gap North America compared with a year earlier when the company had higher levels of promotional spending and price cuts, the spokesman said. Same-store sales fell 10 percent at Banana Republic. Gap, said total sales for the five weeks ended April 5 fell 12 percent to $1.37 billion. The company stood by its full-year earnings forecast of $1.20 to $1.27 a share. Gap shares traded at $18.40 on Thursday in premarket electronic trading, down from Wednesday's New York Stock Exchange close of $18.89. (Reporting by  Brad Dorfman , editing by Dave Zimmerman)
