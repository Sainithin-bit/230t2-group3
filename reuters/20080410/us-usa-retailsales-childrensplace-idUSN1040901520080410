 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Children's Place Retail Stores Inc ( PLCE.O ) said on Thursday that sales at stores open at least a year fell 3 percent in March. 

 Wall Street analysts, on average, had expected a same-store sales gain of 1.5 percent, according to Reuters Estimates. The children's clothing retailer said total sales rose 3 percent for the five weeks ended April 5. The company now classifies the Disney Stores North America business, which it plans to exit, as discontinued operations and no longer includes the stores in its monthly sales results. Separately, Children's Place said general merchandise manager Jill Kronenberg resigned to spend more time with her family. Dina Sweeney and Celeste Risimini-Johnson have been promoted to split her duties, the company said. (Reporting by  Brad Dorfman ; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn and Steve Orlofsky)
