 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Teen clothing retailer American Eagle Outfitters Inc ( AEO.N ) cut its first-quarter outlook on Thursday citing a 12 percent drop in March sales at stores open at least a year, which was worse than expected. 

 Analysts, on average, had expected March same-store sales to fall 8.9 percent, according to Reuters Estimates. Total sales fell 2 percent for the five weeks ended April 5 to $267.3 million. While shopper traffic was weak throughout the month, it was particularly low during the Easter holiday and spring break period, the company said. Same-store sales fell in all regions of the United States, American Eagle said in a recorded call. Citing the same-store sales drop, the company cut its profit forecast for the first quarter to 18 cents to 20 cents a share. It had previously forecast a per-share profit of 25 cents to 27 cents.
