 (Reuters) - Here are the main facts about Canada's decision to block the $1.325 billion sale by MacDonald Dettwiler and Associates Ltd ( MDA.TO ) of sensitive satellite and robotics technology to U.S. rocket-maker Alliant Techsystems Inc ( ATK.N ): 

 * The 1985 Investment Canada Act obliges Ottawa to review all proposed purchases of Canadian firms by foreign companies that are worth C$270 million ($265 million) or more. * The decision by Industry Minister Jim Prentice to block the sale on the grounds it was not in the national interest is the first time the government has ever moved to halt a deal. * Alliant Tech has 30 days from April 8 to appeal the decision. * Even if Prentice changes his mind and approves the deal, Foreign Minister Maxime Bernier would also have give his backing. Under the terms of a 2005 law governing the operation of remote sensing space systems, the foreign minister has special power over satellite systems deemed critical to national security. * Canada says it expects to introduce a separate national security test for foreign takeovers of Canadian companies by the end of June.
