 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The cost of protecting Time Warner's debt with credit default swaps rose nearly 15 percent on Thursday after a report that it is closing in on a deal to combine Internet operations with Yahoo Inc. 

 Five-year credit default swaps on Time Warner rose by about 20 basis points to about 156 basis points, or $156,000 a year for five years to protect $10 million of debt, according to data from Markit Intraday.  The deal would fold Time Warner's AOL business, excluding its legacy dial-up Internet access operations, into a combined Yahoo company and would value AOL at $10 billion, a person familiar with the talks said. Yahoo would receive cash from Time Warner in exchange for 20 percent of a combined Yahoo-AOL, the source said. News Corp is also considering joining Microsoft Corp in a bid for Yahoo, newspaper reports said.
