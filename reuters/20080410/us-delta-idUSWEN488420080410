 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Delta Air Lines Inc said on Thursday it would record a net loss for the first quarter of 2008. 

 The U.S. No. 3 airline, which came out of bankruptcy last year, said in a regulatory filing it would not record a tax benefit for the quarter, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. (Reporting by  Bill Rigby , editing by Richard Chang)
