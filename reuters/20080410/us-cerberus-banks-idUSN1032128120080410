 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management LP CBS.UL has been assembling its resources with a view to buying some banking assets, the New York Post reported, citing people familiar with the matter. 

 Cerberus, headed by Stephen Feinberg, has about $7 billion in free cash to invest, the Post said, citing sources. The firm has been looking into loan and property portfolios of certain regional banks, even as the financial sector is rocked by the credit crunch, the report said. Cerberus, which bought 80 percent of Chrysler LLC last year, was not available for comment. (Reporting by  Aarthi Sivaraman , editing by Will Waterman)
