 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Apparel retailer Abercrombie & Fitch Co ( ANF.N ) said on Thursday that sales at stores open at least a year fell a greater-than-expected 10 percent in March, citing earlier Easter and Spring Break holidays. 

 Analysts on average were expecting a same-store sales decline of 4.5 percent, according to Reuters Estimates. The New Albany, Ohio-based company, which operates the Abercrombie & Fitch, Hollister and RUEHL chains, said total sales for the five weeks ended April 5 fell to $330.2 million, from $331.2 million a year ago. By division, sales at stores open at least a year fell 2 percent at the company's namesake chain and 14 percent at its abercrombie chain for children. Sales fell 16 percent at Hollister and 21 percent at RUEHL. Abercrombie shares fell 2 percent to $72.48 in premarket trading.
