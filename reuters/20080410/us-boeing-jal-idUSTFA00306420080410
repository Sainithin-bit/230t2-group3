 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japan Airlines Corp (JAL) 9205.T said on Thursday it may seek compensation from Boeing Co ( BA.N ) for a third major delay in the delivery of the new Boeing 787 Dreamliner plane. 

 JAL spokesman Hirokazu Inoue said the company would start talks with Boeing about compensation once the impact from the delay on its business became clear. All Nippon Airways ( 9202.T ), which is scheduled to be the first airline to receive the 787, also said earlier it was considering seeking compensation (Reporting by  Aiko Hayashi ; Editing by  Rodney Joyce )
