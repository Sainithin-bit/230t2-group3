 ROME  (Reuters) - Italian Deputy Economy Minister Vittorio Grilli on Monday ruled out the introduction of a wealth tax, or other new taxes, to raise additional revenue. 
 The government "does not have plans" for a wealth tax or other fiscal measures, Grilli said during testimony before the Chamber of Deputies parliamentary budget committee. To stave off a full-blown default in the country's 1.9-trillion-euro debt, Prime Minister Mario Monti's government introduced an austerity package in December with 24 billion euros in new taxes for this year alone.
