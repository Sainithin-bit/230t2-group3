 MADRID  (Reuters) - Spain's Treasury said on Monday it will issue from one billion euros ($1.32 billion) to two billion euros in 3- and 6-month bills at auction on Tuesday. 
 A source at the Economy Ministry said the low target set for Tuesday's sale was a result of the Treasury having sold more than planned in sovereign debt so far for the year. (Reporting by Nigel Davies; editing Paul Day)
