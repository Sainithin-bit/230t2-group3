 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Video rental company Netflix Inc has no plans to sell its DVD division, Chief Executive Reed Hastings said on Monday during a conference call with analysts. 
 Some industry analysts have speculated Netflix might sell the DVD unit as it turns into a company that streams movies and TV shows to Internet-connected televisions and devices. (Reporting By  Lisa Richwine ; Editing by  Gary Hill )
