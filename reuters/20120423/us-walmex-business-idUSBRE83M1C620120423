 MEXICO CITY  (Reuters) - Wal-Mart de Mexico, or Walmex, battling bribery accusations, said in a statement on Monday it does not believe the allegations will hurt its business. 
 The New York Times reported this weekend that the Mexican unit of U.S. retail giant Wal-Mart Stores Inc silenced an internal investigation of hundreds of suspect payments worth more than $24 million made to grow its business in Mexico. (Reporting By Cyntia Barrera Diaz)
