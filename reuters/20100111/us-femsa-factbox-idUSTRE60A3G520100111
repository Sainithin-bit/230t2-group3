 (Reuters) - Heineken NV will buy the beer business of Mexico's FEMSA in a $7.9 billion deal that boosts the Dutch brewer's emerging-market presence and cements an alliance with Latin America's biggest beverage company. 

 Here are some facts about FEMSA: * FEMSA is one of the world's largest brewers by volume and often pegged as a target in global beer industry consolidation because of its strong brands and growth. Its chief rival in Mexico is Grupo Modelo. * FEMSA makes Bohemia, Carta Blanca, Dos Equis, Sol and Tecate. It sold 12 billion pesos ($889 million) worth of beer worldwide in the third quarter of 2009, for which it posted a profit of 2.5 billion pesos ($187 million). * FEMSA also owns one of the world's biggest Coke bottlers, Coca-Cola Femsa, but in a twist of fate sealed at the start of the 20th century, it does not own the license to sell Coca-Cola in pop-guzzling northern Mexico. * FEMSA's beermaking division is credited with sparking industrialization in northern Mexico at the end of the 19th century, when the company's success attracted glass and steelmakers to bottle and cap its brews. * FEMSA, which produced its first beer in 1890, owns the concession to manage top-flight Mexican football team Rayados de Monterrey in its home city of Monterrey, near Texas. * FEMSA's Mexico-traded shares fell sharply on Monday, sinking 13.4 percent to 54.65 pesos. The company's New York-traded stock dropped 13.0 percent to $43.28.
