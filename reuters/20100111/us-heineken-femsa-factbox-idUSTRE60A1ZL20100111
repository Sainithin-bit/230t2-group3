 AMSTERDAM  (Reuters) - Heineken NV will buy the beer business of Mexico's FEMSA for more than $5 billion in stock, in a deal that gives the Dutch brewer a strong position in the Mexican and Brazilian markets. 

 Here are five facts about the deal: * The transaction will give Heineken a 43 percent market share in Mexico and a share of about 9 percent in Brazil. FEMSA's best-known brands include Sol, Tecate, Carta Blanca, Dos Equis and Kaiser. * FEMSA will get 86 million new Heineken NV shares on closing and 29 million existing Heineken NV shares over the five years after closing. Heineken intends to buy back those 29 million shares from current holders and then transfer them out to FEMSA. * FEMSA has agreed to swap 43 million of the new Heineken NV shares for 43 million Heineken Holding shares. That would leave Heineken Holding with a stake of 50.005 percent in Heineken NV. It also allows the Heineken family, which controls Heineken Holding, to retain control of Heineken NV. * FEMSA will end up with 12.5 percent of Heineken NV and 14.9 percent of Heineken Holding. Heineken said those stakes represent a 20 percent economic interest in the total group. * Charlene de Carvalho-Heineken, who inherited her father's controlling stake in the company in 2002, is ranked by Forbes as one of the world's ten richest women. She also ranks as the second-richest person in the Netherlands, according to Dutch magazine Quote. (Reporting by  Ben Berkowitz ; editing by John Stonestreet)
