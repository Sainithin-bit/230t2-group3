 MIAMI  (Reuters) - A decline in trading activity by individual investors reflects skittishness over the United States and global economies and a seasonal summer slowdown, the head of TD Ameritrade ( AMTD.O ) said in an interview on Tuesday. 

 Fred Tomczyk, chief executive of the discount broker, said it was too early to tell if figures showing a drop-off in trading last month by retail investors marked a permanent shift in investor sentiment. Worries about the prospects of a double-dip recession in the United States, inflation in China and India and the European debt crisis have put individual investors on edge, he said. "Right now, I think ... the uncertainty is weighing on people. It's a lot for a savvy investor, never mind the normal retail investor," he said. Tomczyk said he did not want to overreact to the pullback. "If it still feels like this in September, October and November, then that's different," he said. Charles Schwab Corp ( SCHW.N ), one of TD Ameritrade's chief competitors, said on Tuesday customer trading activity slowed substantially last month, a sign that retail investors may be losing confidence in the stock market. Schwab said total client trades, a measure of investor engagement, were down 23 percent in May from a year earlier and off 9 percent from April. The month-to-month decline at Schwab was steeper than what TD Ameritrade, which attracts more active trading customers, experienced. "While the active traders may be investing, the retail investor has one foot in the market and one foot out and is saying, 'I'm going to sit tight' until some of these uncertainties clear up," Tomczyk said. "So a lot of people are very hesitant and reticent right now." "My own two cents is I think there is some negativism that has gotten into the market. I think it may be a bit overdone, but only time will tell."
