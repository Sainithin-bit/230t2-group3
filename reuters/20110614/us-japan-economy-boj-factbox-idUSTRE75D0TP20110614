 TOKYO  (Reuters) - The Bank of Japan expanded a loan scheme for growth industries on Tuesday by setting up a new credit line targeting asset-based lending, in an effort to battle chronic ills that have been plaguing the economy since long before it was hit by the March 11 earthquake. 

 As widely expected, the central bank held off on easing monetary policy further and kept its benchmark interest rate at a range of zero to 0.1 percent by a unanimous vote. Below are details of the new step: -- The BOJ will lend up to 500 billion yen ($6.23 billion) to commercial banks that make equity investments and extend asset-based lending, or loans without real estate collateral or guarantees. -- It will allow each bank to borrow up to 50 billion yen at 0.1 percent interest for up to four years. The lending cap is set separately from the 150 billion yen ceiling for the existing 3 trillion yen loan scheme for growth industries. -- It will allow commercial banks to borrow within the outstanding amount of eligible equity investments and loans including asset-based lending made from April 2010. The minimum amount of loans that the banks can make to their clients will be 1 million yen, compared with 10 million yen in the existing scheme. -- It will accept applications for the loans until March 31, 2012, keeping the deadline unchanged from the main loan scheme.
