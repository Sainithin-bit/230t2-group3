 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japan's Tokyo Electric Power Co, the operator of a tsunami-stricken nuclear power plant, said on Tuesday it would was preparing to make fair and speedy compensation payouts under a scheme approved by the government after the world's worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl. 

 "We hope that the proposed bill will be enacted in parliament as soon as possible," the company said in a statement. Japan's cabinet earlier approved a scheme to help Tokyo Electric compensate those affected by the radiation crisis at its stricken nuclear plant, a step forward in a slow-moving process that has frustrated not only the victims but also investors.
