 TOKYO, Jun  (Reuters) - Japan's Tokyo Electric Power Co, the operator of a tsunami-stricken nuclear power plant, should avoid raising electricity prices when paying out compensation for the world's worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl, the top government spokesman said on Tuesday. 

 The cabinet earlier approved a scheme to help Tokyo Electric compensate those affected by the radiation crisis at its stricken nuclear plant, a step forward in a slow-moving process that has frustrated not only the victims but also investors. (Reporting by  Chisa Fujioka )
