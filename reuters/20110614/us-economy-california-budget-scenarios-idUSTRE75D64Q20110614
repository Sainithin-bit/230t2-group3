 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - California lawmakers face a Wednesday deadline to pass a budget or forfeit pay but have not found common ground to close a $10 billion shortfall. 

 Despite concerns for the state's credit rating and their own reputation, Democrats who control the legislature do not have Republican support to increase taxes to help close the deficit. Democratic Governor Jerry Brown has suggested he could be open to an expedient budget for the year beginning in July. Following are a few budget options for Democratic lawmakers, who could also ignore the June 15 deadline altogether and brace for the all-too-familiar summertime budget battle with Republicans: LEGISLATORS PUT TAXES ON STATE BALLOT Brown wants Californians to vote on a tax hike but Republicans oppose an election. Democrats could amend an existing voter-approved tax measure to include tax extensions and forward it to the ballot. They would not need Republican support since a simple majority would suffice to amend the measure, rather than the two-thirds for a new tax measure. The downside for Democrats would be that doing so could be perceived by the public as a dodgy tactic and a court challenge would be likely. The upside for Democrats would be that tax extensions could be left to voters, in line with Brown's vow to ultimately leave the matter to them for either their approval or rejection. RAISE REVENUE PROJECTIONS (PUT ON ROSE-COLORED GLASSES) Brown in May unveiled a revised budget plan that forecast improving revenue through the next fiscal year -- to the tune of $6.6 billion. He used the forecast to reduce the state's shortfall to about $10 billion from about $15 billion. Democrats could make the case that his forecast was too conservative and that due to stronger-than-expected growth in tax collections, billions of dollars more in revenue could be written into the state's budget to further narrow its deficit. THE COMBINATION PLATTER A third option for Democratic budget writers would be to couple a more aggressive revenue forecast with a menu of one-time moves to delay payments or raise revenues through asset sales. Many of these tactics, which analysts frequently refer to as "smoke and mirrors," have already been used and are no longer options. Budget writers could also pencil in money from the controversial planned sale of state buildings under former Republican Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. Brown wants to kill the sale but Democrats could revive it to bank its proceeds. They could also propose liquidating unused or underused state facilities. Democrats could also try to tap funds belonging to local redevelopment agencies, which Brown had proposed eliminating. COMPROMISE WITH REPUBLICANS Four Republicans who had been in budget talks with Brown unveiled on Monday six pages of proposals for a budget compromise. The proposals revolve around a spending cap, restructuring pensions and overhauling regulations, which are intended to cut the state government's expenses and encourage more economic activity. Brown has signaled he is open to sweeping some of the proposals into a budget compromise. Democrats in the legislature have been less open. (Reporting by Jim Christie; Editing by  David Lawder )
