 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Bank of Japan Governor Masaaki Shirakawa said on Tuesday he sees some positive surprises for Japan's economy in the short term, such as the steady progress manufacturers are making in restoring supply chains after the March 11 earthquake. 

 But he added that he saw negative factors that could affect Japan's economy in the long term, such as the risk of power shortages weighing on output. Following are key quotes from Shirakawa's news conference: JAPAN ECONOMY "Right after the earthquake, supply chain disruptions and power supply posed severe problems even though we expected the economy to recover once these were resolved ... Many business people held very cautious views ... but the BOJ was not so pessimistic about the macroeconomic situation. "We were thinking somewhat brightly when we issued our outlook report, but compared with our forecast, we have seen positive surprises in the past month. There have been positive surprises in the near term, but sources of concern are emerging when looking at the medium to long term." GLOBAL ECONOMY "Emerging economies will likely sustain their strong growth as a trend." (Reporting by  Leika Kihara , Rie Ishiguro,  Tetsushi Kajimoto  and  Yoko Kubota ; Editing by  Joseph Radford )
