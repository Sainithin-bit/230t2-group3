 (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury Department on Tuesday said that 10 of the country's banks including Morgan Stanley and JP Morgan Chase & Co were cleared to pay back a combined $68 billion in financial rescue funds. 

 If all the money is repaid by the banks, the government's Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP, should have unallocated funds of about $122 billion. The calculation is based on data from TARP's special inspector general and assumes full funding of bank capital injections as well as for the government's toxic asset purchase program. Following is an outline of funds spent or pledged from the U.S. bailout fund so far: -- An unspecified amount pledged to recapitalize some of the country's largest banks, if needed, in the wake of regulatory "stress tests." Regulators required 10 of the 19 banks tested to raise a combined $74.6 billion. About $65 billion has been raised by these banks from private investors so far. -- The Treasury has allotted $100 billion to seed its public-private plan to buy up to $500 billion worth of toxic assets. The figure includes $25 billion to expand the Federal Reserve's Term Asset-Backed Loan Facility, or TALF, to accept so-called legacy assets as collateral. -- The Treasury estimates that it will provide $218 billion in capital to banks under its original Capital Purchase Program, which was initially pegged at $250 billion. In its latest transaction report, covering the period June 3, the Treasury said it had net investments of $199.40 billion under this program. -- $50 billion pledged to reduce mortgage foreclosures by providing incentives to lenders and servicers to modify loans. It has allocated $15.17 billion in potential incentives to 15 firms so far and $10 billion for incentives to modify loans in the hardest-hit markets. -- $20 billion investment in Citigroup as part of a package in which the government agreed to share in losses on $301 billion of assets. In addition, the Treasury has disbursed $5 billion as part of its second-loss guarantee. The $20 billion is in addition to $25 billion disbursed as part of the Capital Purchase Program. -- $20 billion investment in Bank of America as part of a package in which the government agreed to share in losses on $118 billion of assets. In addition, the Treasury has pledged to cover up to $7.5 billion in potential losses as part of a second-loss guarantee. The $20 billion is in addition to $25 billion disbursed as part of the Capital Purchase Program. -- $69.835 billion preferred stock investment in troubled insurer American International Group. This was reduced by $165 million from an earlier commitment, representing the amount of controversial bonuses paid by AIG in March. -- $80.27 billion has been promised to prop up the U.S. auto industry, including bankruptcy financing and other loans to GM and Chrysler LLC, $5 billion in support for auto parts suppliers, and a $12.5 billion investment in GMAC LLC. Of the total amount, the department said it made available up to $30.10 billion in bankruptcy financing for General Motors on June 3. -- $20 billion has been shifted to a special purpose vehicle to cover potential losses on $200 billion in lending under the Fed's TALF. Treasury officials say they intend to provide an additional $35 billion to enlarge this program for lending against recently originated securities. When considered in conjunction with the $25 billion being set aside to expand TALF to cover older securities, the Treasury has said it intends to commit $80 billion to TALF. -- $15 billion pledged to purchase securities backed by Small Business Administration loans.
