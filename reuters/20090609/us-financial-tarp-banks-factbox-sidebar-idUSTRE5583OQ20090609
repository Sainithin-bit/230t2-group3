 (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury said on Tuesday that 10 major banks have been approved to repay taxpayer funds received under the Troubled Asset Relief Program. 

 The Treasury did not identify the 10, but below is a list of banks that are repaying TARP funds, according to either sources or spokespeople. Following that is a list of banks that have met at least two of the eligibility requirements to repay TARP: issuing equity and selling debt without a government guarantee. Below that is a list of the remaining largest U.S. banks. Apart from Northern Trust, all banks below underwent a special test of capital adequacy last month, known as a "stress test."
