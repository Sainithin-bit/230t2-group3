 MILAN  (Reuters) - Italian automaker Fiat SpA will not abandon its purchase of ailing U.S. peer Chrysler even if the deal is not completed by a June 15 deadline, a spokesman said on Tuesday. 

 He said Fiat would have no comment on the U.S. Supreme Court order blocking the sale until it had more information about it. "Fiat will not walk away from the deal if it isn't completed by the June 15 deadline," he said. (Reporting by  Ian Simpson )
