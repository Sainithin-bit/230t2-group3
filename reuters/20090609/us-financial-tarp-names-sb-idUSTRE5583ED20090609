 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Ten U.S. banks were approved to repay the federal bailout funds they received under the Troubled Asset Relief Program, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters on Tuesday. 

 The source identified the banks as Northern Trust Corp, BB&T Corp, Morgan Stanley, State Street Corp, JPMorgan Chase & Co, US Bancorp, American Express Co, Capital One Financial Corp, Goldman Sachs Group Inc and Bank of New York Mellon Corp. The source spoke on condition of anonymity because the Treasury Department did not disclose the list of names itself. (Reporting by  Karey Wutkowski ; Editing by Gerald E.
