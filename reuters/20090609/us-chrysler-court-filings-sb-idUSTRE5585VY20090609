 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Chrysler LLC, Italian carmaker Fiat SpA and the Obama administration all told the U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday that the bankrupt automaker's sale needs to be quickly approved before June 15. 

 Although a Fiat spokesman said on Tuesday in Italy the company would not walk away from the deal if it were not completed by June 15, Fiat's lawyers told the Supreme Court that Chrysler could be forced into liquidation if the sale does not go through by that deadline. Representing the Obama administration's views, Solicitor General Elena Kagan said a "substantial possibility" exists that Fiat will abandon the deal or insist on materially different terms if the sale does not go through by June 15.
