 April 14 - Chrysler LLC and Fiat SpA ( FIA.MI ) of Italy are discussing a new management and board for the troubled U.S. automaker under a proposed alliance that could see Fiat take a stake in Chrysler, Automotive News has reported. 

 Chrysler, once an American icon, has moved from market dominance to federal bail-out to potential foreign control over the last 80 years. It is racing to complete a partnership with Fiat by April 30, with U.S. President Barack Obama's administration warning the alternative would be bankruptcy. Following are key developments in Chrysler since U.S. private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management CBS.UL bought a controlling stake in 2007: May 2007 - Germany's Daimler AG ( DAIGn.DE ) agrees to sell 80.1 percent of Chrysler to Cerberus for $7.4 billion. Daimler keeps a 19.9 percent stake in Chrysler. September 2008 - Daimler confirms talks with Cerberus to sell its remaining 19.9 percent stake in Chrysler. October 10 - General Motors ( GM.N ) is holding preliminary talks about acquiring Chrysler, according to sources. October 22 - Nissan Motor Co ( 7201.T ) proposes buying about 20 percent of Chrysler and bring it into the French-Japanese alliance with Renault SA ( RENA.PA ), the Detroit News reports. November 7 - South Korea's Hyundai Motor Co ( 005380.KS ) holds talks with Cerberus about a potential acquisition of the Jeep brand and possibly other assets. The emergence of Korea's largest automaker as a potential bidder came on the same day GM says it has shelved its own pursuit of buying Chrysler. Hyundai denies its interest the following day. November 13 - Chrysler needs federal funding and an alliance with other automakers in the United States or abroad to survive the crisis, Chief Executive Bob Nardelli says. November 26 - Cerberus is demanding more than $7 billion from Daimler over losses that followed its 2007 acquisition of Chrysler, Daimler says. The German car maker dismisses the claim as baseless and says the demands by Cerberus have complicated talks over the sale of its remaining 19.9 percent stake. January 2, 2009 - Chrysler receives an initial $4 billion emergency loan from the U.S. government. January 14 - Chrysler says it would not sell an individual brand like Jeep, in response to reports that Chrysler had been in talks to sell assets to Renault-Nissan and auto parts supplier Magna International MGa.TO. January 20 - Italy's Fiat unveils a preliminary deal to take a 35 percent stake in Chrysler in exchange for access to its technology and overseas markets. March 16 - Chrysler's proposed deal with Fiat is worth up to $10 billion and could preserve 5,000 North American manufacturing jobs, Nardelli says. March 30 - The Obama administration's autos task force rejects Chrysler's restructuring plan and warns it could be put through bankruptcy to reduce its debts. It gives Chrysler 30 days to complete an alliance with Fiat or risk being cut off from further government funding and be forced into liquidation. Chrysler is seeking another $5 billion. April 3 - Chrysler's lenders talk with the U.S. government to reduce the car maker's debt by swapping some of it for cash, equity or new debt, according to sources. April 13 - Chrysler and Fiat are discussing a new management and board for the U.S. automaker under a proposed alliance. The Wall Street Journal reports that Chrysler's creditors plan to make a counter-offer to the U.S. Treasury, under which they could ask for equity in the company that could combine Chrysler with Fiat in exchange for concessions.
