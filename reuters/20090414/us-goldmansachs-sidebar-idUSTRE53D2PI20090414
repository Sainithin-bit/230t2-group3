 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc views returning the $10 billion it received in a U.S. government bailout as its "duty" as long as the move does not hurt its business or the broader financial system, its chief financial officer said on Tuesday. 

 CFO David Viniar spoke on a conference call a day after the investment bank -- now officially a bank holding company -- reported much better than forecast quarterly earnings and said it plans to raise $5 billion as part of a bid to repay the Troubled Asset Relief Program funds. Viniar said Goldman had benefited in the quarter from a retreat from the marketplace by many of its traditional rivals, but it continues to be cautious about the near-term outlook for its businesses given the macroeconomic conditions. The financial system still faces "extremely difficult macroeconomic conditions," Viniar told analysts and investors. Goldman shares were down 2.3 percent at $127.10 in premarket trading.
