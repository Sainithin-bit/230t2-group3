 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The former CEO of Qwest International Inc ( Q.N ), convicted of insider trading, lost his bid to further delay his prison sentence on Tuesday after the U.S. Supreme Court rejected his appeal. 

 Justice Stephen Breyer turned down Joseph Nacchio's emergency request to remain free while the U.S. Supreme Court considers whether to review his case and hear his appeal. The former chief executive officer was convicted in 2007 on 19 counts of insider trading related to sales of Qwest stock in 2001, after company officials warned him the company could not meet its financial targets. He was scheduled to start serving his six-year prison term on Tuesday. (Reporting by  James Vicini , Editing by Leslie Gevirtz)
