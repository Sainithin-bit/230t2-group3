 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is reviewing whether Bank of America Corp ( BAC.N ) violated federal securities law by failing to disclose Merrill Lynch & Co's plan to pay $3.62 billion of bonuses before the companies merged. 

 The regulator is "carefully reviewing" Bank of America's disclosures, SEC Chairman Mary Schapiro said, responding in a letter to a query from Democratic Representative Dennis Kucinich. Merrill awarded the bonuses just before the merger closed on January 1, rather than wait until the new year as in the past. The company granted the payouts even as it was posting a $27.61 billion full-year loss, with more than half of that deficit coming in the fourth quarter alone. Critics have questioned how much Bank of America knew about the bonuses and why it failed to disclose details before shareholders voted on the Merrill acquisition on December 5. The purchase created the largest U.S. bank by assets. "Where the SEC believes that there has been an omission of material facts necessary in order to make the statements made not misleading, we will carry out our enforcement responsibilities with vigor and vigilance," Schapiro said in the April 10 letter, posted on the website of Kucinich. A spokesman for Bank of America declined comment. An SEC spokesman said: "One should not infer from the letter the existence or non-existence of an enforcement investigation." Merrill's bonuses prompted New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo to sue Bank of America for details of the payouts, including the names of top recipients. Bank of America faces a slew of investor lawsuits over the acquisition, which critics say hurt its share price. Although shares of the Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank have quadrupled since mid-February, they are down about two-thirds since the merger was announced September 15.
