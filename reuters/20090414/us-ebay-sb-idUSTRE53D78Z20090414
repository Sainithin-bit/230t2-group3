 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - eBay Inc has hired investment bank Goldman Sachs to manage Skype's separation from the company and run the process for an initial public offering, a source close to eBay said. 

 The Web auction site announced earlier on Tuesday it was planning to spin off its Skype Web telephone services unit through an IPO. (Reporting by  Anupreeta Das ; Editing by  Bernard Orr )
