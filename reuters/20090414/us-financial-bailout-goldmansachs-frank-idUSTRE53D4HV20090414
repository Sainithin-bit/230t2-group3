 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The chairman of the U.S. House Financial Services Committee, Rep. Barney Frank, said on Tuesday he welcomed Goldman Sachs Group Inc's plan to repay government bailout funds. 

 "I am very pleased," Frank, a Massachusetts Democrat, told Reuters. "To the extent that we have people pay it back, we should welcome that. It goes into the Treasury." Goldman Sachs said on Tuesday it has a "duty" to repay the $10 billion in taxpayer money it was given in October.
