 HONG KONG  (Reuters) - Chinese oil major PetroChina Co Ltd ( 0857.HK ) reported a 26 percent drop in fourth-quarter net profit on Thursday, lagging forecasts, as strong upstream gains were offset by massive losses at its refining segment. 
 PetroChina ( 601857.SS )( PTR.N ), the country's dominant oil and gas producer that also owns refineries, posted a fourth-quarter net profit of 29.55 billion yuan ($4.69 billion), down from 40 billion yuan in the same period in 2010, based on Reuters' calculations. The result compared with a forecast of 35.17 billion yuan, according to Reuters calculations. For the full year, the state-run company posted a net profit of 132.96 billion yuan, versus 139.99 billion yuan in 2010. The result compared with a consensus forecast of 138.58 billion yuan from 31 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
