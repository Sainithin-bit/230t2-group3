 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The Treasury Department on Monday announced it will increase the size of its debt securities auctions to address increased funding needs posed by the $700 billion financial rescue package signed last week. 

 Treasury said it would boost the volume of auctions of bills and coupon securities, issue cash management bills, and may reintroduce the 3-year note, acting Treasury Undersecretary Anthony Ryan said in a statement. (Reporting by  Mark Felsenthal , Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)
