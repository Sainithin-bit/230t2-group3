 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co and Citigroup Inc were working on Monday morning with the U.S. government on a compromise over their bids to buy Wachovia Corp, a person familiar with the situation said. 

 The options being considered include dividing up Wachovia between the two feuding suitors, this person said, and added that Wells Fargo would still like to buy all of Wachovia. Citigroup said last Monday it had reached a preliminary agreement to pay $2.2 billion for Wachovia's banking assets, in a deal that included a U.S. government guarantee of any losses beyond $42 billion on a $312 billion mortgage portfolio. But Wells Fargo said on Friday it signed an agreement with Wachovia to buy the whole of the company for $15 billion without any government guarantees.
