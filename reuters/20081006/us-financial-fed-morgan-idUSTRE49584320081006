 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve on Monday gave its approval for Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Inc. ( 8306.T ) to acquire up to 24.9 percent of the voting shares of Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ). 

 Mitsubishi UFJ last week agreed to buy a 21 percent stake in Morgan Stanley for $9 billion, giving the U.S. firm a much-needed capital injection. The two firms have agreed to a "strategic alliance", details of which are still being hammered out. (Reporting by Patrick Rucker)
