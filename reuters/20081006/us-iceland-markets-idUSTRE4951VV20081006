 REYKJAVIK  (Reuters) - Iceland's government, scrambling to avert a full-fledged market meltdown, planned further talks on Monday after working through the weekend to produce a package of financial stability measures. 

 The country's prime minister told state television late Sunday night the country's authorities had not agreed any specific crisis measures "at this time". He said banks had agreed to sell off overseas assets and the government would meet with pension funds on Monday. The country's banking minister told state radio on Monday that the drafting of a plan to help the financial system was "well under way". Commerce and Banking Minister Bjorgvin Sigurdsson said it was impossible to give further information. The chief executive of Iceland's stock exchange said the bourse would open on Monday, Icelandic radio reported. But Thordur Fridjonsson said the exchange was holding a meeting to decide if shares in the island's banking groups would be traded. Iceland, hoping to bring home desperately needed foreign currency, has asked pension funds to repatriate cash. The overseas market in the crown has dried up and banks outside the island were quoting rates for the currency on Friday some 7-8 percent lower than local rates. Icelandic state radio reported over the weekend that the country's association of pension funds had agreed to transfer 200 billion Icelandic crowns ($1.8 billion) to the state. The transfer will have to be approved by member pension funds and the money must be guaranteed by the state. Another option for cash would be to activate a Nordic swap facility that was set up earlier this year. A spokesman for Sweden's central bank said the Riksbank had not been asked by Iceland about using the swap. Norway's central bank declined to comment. DECREASING ACTIVITY Iceland's financial system has been rocked by the international credit crisis and the state has already been forced to rescue one bank -- Glitnir. Credit agencies have cut Iceland's sovereign debt rating on worries about the banking system. Iceland's financial firms have been frozen out of credit markets over concerns they took on too much debt during a rapid overseas expansion during the last few years. Prime Minister Haarde said the banks would now shrink foreign involvement. "The banks have agreed to decrease their activities abroad and sell assets," he said. Landsbanki, the island's second biggest bank by value has already sold off some businesses. Last week it said it would dispose of the majority of its overseas corporate finance and brokerage platforms to Straumur-Burdaras, another Icelandic financial firm. It will sell operations in the United Kingdom, continental Europe and Ireland. Iceland's media reported over the weekend the chief executive of Kaupthing, the island's biggest bank by value, held discussions the prime minister which included the possibility of Icelandic banks selling off foreign assets to strengthen the country's currency reserves. Kaupthing Chief Executive Hreidar Mar Sigurdsson said there had been no talk of the government coming to Kaupthing's aid and there was no need for such a move. In addition to Iceland, Kaupthing has important operations in Britain, Denmark, Finland, Norway, Sweden and Luxembourg. Its most recent acquisitions were of corporate lender FIH Erhvervsbank in Denmark in 2004 and British bank and fund manager Singer & Friedlander in 2005. Glitnir has its main overseas operations in Norway and Sweden. (Editing by Chris Pizzey)
