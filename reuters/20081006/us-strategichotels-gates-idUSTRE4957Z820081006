 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Billionaire Bill Gates's Cascade Investment on Monday reported a 5.6 percent active stake in Strategic Hotels & Resorts Inc ( BEE.N ). 

 The fund said in a regulatory filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that recent declines in Strategic Hotels' stock price had prompted it to consider all of its alternatives with respect to the investment. Cascade said it may have discussions with Strategic Hotels' board of directors and management about the company's business and strategic direction. (Reporting by  Karey Wutkowski )
