 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A U.S. judge scheduled a Tuesday hearing for Wachovia to argue for a restraining order against Citigroup not to interfere with Wachovia's deal with Wells Fargo & Co. 

 U.S. District Court Judge Lewis Kaplan issued the order on Monday in New York as the banking giants engaged in a legal battle in state and federal courts over North Carolina-based Wachovia. (Reporting by  Grant McCool )
