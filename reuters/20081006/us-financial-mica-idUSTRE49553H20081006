 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - A U.S. lawmaker on Monday raised the possibility of a special counsel to investigate the financial "mess" on Wall Street. 

 "First of all, I think it's very important that we investigate how we got into this financial mess," Rep. John Mica, a Florida Republican, told a House of Representatives Oversight and Government Reform Committee hearing. Mica said at the hearing held to discuss causes of the collapse of major banking institutions that he planned to consult with colleagues about asking for a special counsel to investigate "this matter."
