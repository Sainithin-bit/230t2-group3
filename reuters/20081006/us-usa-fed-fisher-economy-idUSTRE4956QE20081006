 WICHITA FALLS, Texas  (Reuters) - Dallas Federal Reserve President Richard Fisher said on Monday the U.S. economy had entered a sustained period of "anemia" with little or no growth because of frozen credit markets. 

 "We are going into a period of anemia. I do think that we will have a period of slow economic growth -- if anything, marginal economic growth -- for a sustained period, into 2009, because the credit markets, which are the lifeblood of capitalism, are closing up," Fisher told reporters following a speech to local business leaders here. "I don't like the word recession," he said. "Whether it's a recession or not is not the point. The point is that we're not growing."
