 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Shares of Citigroup Inc dropped 6 percent to $17.25 on Monday on uncertainty about plans to take over embattled Wachovia Corp . 

 The Federal Reserve was pushing Citigroup and Wells Fargo & Co to compromise over their competing bids for the hobbled bank that could result in them carving up its assets, people familiar with the matter said. Wachovia shares were down 14.7 percent at $5.30 before the bell, while those of Wells Fargo dropped 3.6 percent to $33.30. (Reporting by  Ellis Mnyandu ; Editing by Kenneth Barry)
