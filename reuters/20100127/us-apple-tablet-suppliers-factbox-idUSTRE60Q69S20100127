 (Reuters) - Apple Inc on Wednesday released the iPad, a 9.7-inch tablet-style computer that has been the talk of the technology world for months. Analysts expect Apple to ship 2 million to 5 million units of the device in its first year. 

 Most technology companies do their own design work, but outsource much of the assembly and manufacturing to companies based in Asia. Although Apple has not said who will provide the components, a number of companies have emerged as likely suppliers. A look at potential suppliers: * Most analysts believe the tablet's application processor -- the brains of the device -- will be provided by PA Semi, a company Apple bought in 2008. * UBS analysts expect the display to come from LG Display, with AU Optronics as a possible second source. Simplo Technology and Dynapack International Technology will supply batteries, UBS said. * Foxconn International Holdings, which manufactures the iPhone for Apple, is believed to also be making the tablet. * Taiwan's Wintek Corp will supply touchscreen panels for the iPad, along with TPK Solutions, an unlisted company also based in Taiwan, sources told Reuters earlier this month. Sources also said AVY Precision Technology Inc, a maker of covers for electronic products, will begin production of aluminum cases in February.
