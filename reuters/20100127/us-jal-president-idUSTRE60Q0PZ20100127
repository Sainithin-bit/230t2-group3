 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japan Airlines Corp 9205.T said on Wednesday it has picked veteran company executive Masaru Onishi as its new president to help lead the bankrupt carrier through a sweeping state-backed restructuring. 

 Onishi, who has over 30 years experience with JAL and a background in maintenance operations, will join industry outsider Kazuo Inamori, already tapped as chairman and CEO, in tackling volatile fuel prices, shrinking passenger numbers and hefty restructuring charges. Onishi, 54, will double as chief operating officer. JAL last week filed for protection from creditors with more than $25 billion in debts, making it Japan's biggest ever bankruptcy by a non-financial firm, and vowed to slash 30 percent of its work force and axe money-losing routes. The carrier, Asia's biggest by revenue, will also need to decide about rival offers of financial aid from Oneworld alliance partner American Airlines AMR.N and Delta Air Lines ( DAL.N ) of the SkyTeam group. Onishi, now head of JAL unit Japan Air Commuter, will be its first president with a background in maintenance operations, in part as the carrier wants to ensure safe flight operations during its restructuring, a JAL spokesman said. Onishi will take up his new post on February 1 alongside Inamori, the 77-year-old founder of electronics maker Kyocera Corp ( 6971.T ). JAL shares, which will be delisted on February 20, were flat at 2 yen (2 cents) at the midday break, giving the company a market value of about $60 million.
