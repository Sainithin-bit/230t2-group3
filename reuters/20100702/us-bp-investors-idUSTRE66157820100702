 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Investors in BP ( BP.L )( BP.N ) expect to see a change in its leadership, with a shake-up possible once the oil giant's leaking well in the Gulf of Mexico is capped, the Financial Times reported on Friday, citing leading shareholders and people close to the group. 

 A management change, with both Chief Executive Tony Hayward's and Chairman Carl-Henric Svanberg's jobs in jeopardy, could come when BP announces a capital raise, the paper said, citing an unnamed source close to the company. Without steps to steady the ship, BP could become a target of a takeover attempt from companies like ExxonMobil ( XOM.N ), Royal Dutch Shell ( RDSa.L ) or PetroChina ( 601857.SS ), the FT said, citing a source working on BP's strategy. A BP spokesman declined to comment. (Reporting by  Paritosh Bansal ; Editing by  Gary Hill )
