 CANBERRA  (Reuters) - Australia ended a damaging dispute with global miners on Friday by dumping its "super profits" tax for a lower resources rent tax exclusively targeting the iron ore and coal industries. 

 The earlier proposed tax had threatened more than $20 billion in investment, according to mining companies, although no major projects had actually been scrapped. Global miners BHP Billiton, Rio Tinto and Xstrata said on Friday they were encouraged by the new tax with the latter immediately reinstating around A$600 million ($490 million) in copper and coal projects. Following is the status of projects either scrapped, put on hold or under threat prior to the new tax proposal REINSTATED: XSTRATA * The global miner said it has reinstated A$586 million of expenditure on its Wandoan thermal coal project and its expansion of its Ernest Henry copper mine. The shelved spending was part of a total planned capital investment of around A$5.4 billion to complete both the Queensland developments. * It also has reactivated A$30 million in copper exploration work in Australia. ON HOLD BUT MAY NOW BE REINSTATED: FORTESCUE METALS GROUP * Solomon Hub, Western Australia - $9 billion proposed investment in 160 million tonnes a year iron ore mine put on hold. Capacity would be roughly equal to what world no.3 iron ore miner BHP Billiton currently mines in Australia. Includes plan to build a new export terminal at Anketell Point, 200 kms (125 miles) south of Fortescue's main export terminal at Port Hedland. Could hit plans by Fortescue to lay its own rail lines from the deposit to the Indian Ocean coastline. * Western Hub, Western Australia - $6 billion proposed investment. Little exploration work done so far on the project. UNDER REVIEW BUT MAY NOW PROCEED BHP BILLITON * Olympic Dam, South Australia - Estimated $20 billion production expansion at world's fourth-largest copper deposit and biggest uranium deposit. BHP is studying a plan to more than triple annual copper production capacity to 730,000 tonnes and more than quadruple uranium production capacity to 19,000 tonnes over 11 years. * Pilbara iron ore, Western Australia - BHP has plans to expand iron ore production capacity from 205 million tonnes a year in 2011 to 240 million tonnes by 2015 and is studying plans to increase that to 350 million tonnes thereafter. * Bowen Basin, Queensland - 45 million tonnes a year expansion in coking coal production to 105 million tonnes a year and export terminal expansion. RIO TINTO * Pilbara iron ore, Western Australia - Plans to nearly triple iron ore production to 600 million tonnes over next 10 years. SCRAPPED; CAPE LAMBERT RESOURCES * Cape Lambert South project, Western Australia - magnetite iron ore project, potentially worth A$400 million ($345 million), scrapped. DELAYED INVESTMENT DECISIONS QUEENSLAND COAL SEAM GAS PROJECTS * BG Group said the new resource tax offers competitive economics for its planned Queensland Curtis LNG project and would recommend the A$10-A$15 billion development to the board for approval later this year. * Santos, which is targeting to approve a 3.4 mtpa LNG project with Malaysia's Petronas, said it welcomed the new tax regime and the certainty it offers. The project was estimated to cost A$7.7 billion in 2008. * Origin Energy made no mention of its planned A$35 billion Australia Pacific LNG project with ConocoPhillips, but said it was encouraged by the new tax and that it  will provide a level of certainty for the industry. The project would produce up to 18 million tonnes of LNG per year. * Royal Dutch Shell - Curtis Island project, 16 million tonnes a year capacity. Bidding A$3.45 billion with PetroChina for Australia's Arrow Energy for its coal seam gas. * Liquefied Natural Gas - A$1 billion Gladstone LNG project, 2 million tonnes a year.
