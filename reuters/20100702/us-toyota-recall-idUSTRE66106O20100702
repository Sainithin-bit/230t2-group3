 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp will recall about 90,000 vehicles, including the Lexus luxury car, in Japan as early as next Monday, a Transport Ministry official said on Friday. 

 The Japanese automaker said on Thursday that it was considering "some kind of measure" that may include the recall of 270,000 vehicles worldwide due to a possible stalling of engines. (Reporting by Nobuhiro Kubo)
