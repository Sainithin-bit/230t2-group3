 SYDNEY  (Reuters) - Australia's watered down mine tax has angered the nation's small iron ore mining companies, who say the new regime favors a handful of international majors who held closed-door negotiations with the government over its design. Smaller miners with profits below A$50 million a ($42 million) year won't be liable for the new tax. 

 But efforts by the miners to secure multi-million dollar rebates on exploration costs included in the original proposal were wiped out under the new tax deal. And a program employed successfully in Canada to allow exploration companies to pass on tax loss credits to investors wasn't even mentioned. The new tax was "skewed toward those companies with lower costs of borrowing, the multinationals," said Fortescue Metals Group Chief Executive Andrew Forrest. "We feel we've been hood-winked though this process." With profits last year of $508 million, Fortescue is almost certain to pay the new tax. While most other iron ore miners are exempt from the government's rejigged 30 percent profits tax, they still complain the tax fails to address long lobbied-for rebates for millions of dollars spent annually exploring for ore without the benefit of hefty cash flows enjoyed by bigger firms from their established operations. "There is nothing to celebrate about this tax," said David Flanagan, managing director of Atlas Iron Ltd. "If you are a junior in the iron ore industry and you were not in the room you can guarantee you'll get stung." Australia sought to end a damaging dispute with mining executives and investors by dumping its far-reaching "super profits" tax for a lower resources rent tax limited to iron ore and coal, clearing a major hurdle to call an early election, which polls suggest Prime Minister Julia Gillard can win. Three of the world's biggest mining houses, BHP Billiton, Rio Tinto and Xstrata, met privately with Gillard and members of her cabinet this week to hammer out a compromise. Australia's minister for resources, Martin Ferguson, is scheduled to meet mining executives next week to hear their concerns, but some are doubtful this will help. "The lack of trust we now have in this government is going to make future negotiations extremely difficult," said Brockman Resources Managing Director Wayne Richards. For decades Rio and BHP have been the sole negotiators for annual iron ore prices, which other producers had no choice but to accept. For the first time this year, prices shifted to quarterly indexes, but only after BHP and Rio gave their blessing. Association of Mining and Exploration Companies (AMEC) President Will Robinson said the interests of its 220 members were left out of the new tax structure in the absence of a tax rebate scheme, leaving it harder to fund ongoing exploration. "AMEC is disappointed that the exploration rebate has been taken off the table," Robinson said. He said AMEC will now lobby Canberra to replace the rebate with a "flow through shares" component for small miners allowing them to pass on tax losses to investors, which would make it easier to raise development capital. "If you're a big company generating revenue, exploration is just a cost. But if you're an exploration company that doesn't have revenue yet there is no benefit," Robinson said. Until recently, iron ore mining was exclusively conducted by Rio and BHP in the Pilbara district of west Australia. But the arrival of Fortescue, Atlas, BC Iron and others has sparked battles over rail and port rights. This week the Australian Competition Tribunal upheld an earlier ruling that BHP must share one of its rail line with other miners, but allowed it to keep a second one to itself. BHP is reviewing the ruling and may appeal. ($1=1.181 Australian Dollar)
