 EISENACH, Germany  (Reuters) - General Motors Co's ( GM.N ) European Opel division has no plans for further factory closures at the moment, interim Chief Executive Thomas Sedran said on Thursday. 
 The stricken European car market may shrink by 4 percent this year, Sedran said at a ceremony at Opel's plant in Eisenach, Germany. Ruesselsheim-based Opel confirmed plans in December to shut a factory in Bochum, Germany. (Reporting by Peter Maushagen; Writing by Andreas Cremer)
