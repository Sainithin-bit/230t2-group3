 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - CVS Caremark Corp has been charging some customers of its SilverScript Medicare prescription-drug programs higher prices than they were promised when they signed up for the plans in late 2009, the Wall Street Journal reported. 

 The company told the Journal it had sent out letters of apology in March. Earlier this year, the company discovered that due to computer price file issue, drug pricing included in the drug plan finder on Medicare.gov and Silverscript.com was incorrect for brand drugs for two of its plans: CVS Caremark Plus and CVS Caremark Complete for Preferred Pharmacies only, CVS Caremark told Reuters. The error resulted in pricing being listed about 4 percent lower than it should have been for brand drugs in the drug plan finder for the two plans. CVS Caremark said it has been charging consumers the higher prices since the beginning of 2010 and generic drugs were not affected by the pricing problem, the Journal said. CVS notified the federal regulator, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), about the problem in January, the Journal said. "When the error was discovered, we informed CMS and worked with them to correct the error and address the potential impact to members," a company spokesperson told Reuters. " We worked with CMS on a communication to all members of both plans." A Medicare spokesman told the Wall Street Journal that it worked in conjunction with CVS to create a response under which CVS would offer a refund for the price difference to people who specifically asked for it. Shares of CVS Caremark on Thursday closed up 2.4 at $34.59 on the New York Stock Exchange. (Reporting by  Ilaina Jonas ; Editing by  Valerie Lee )
