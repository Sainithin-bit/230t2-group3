 LISBON  (Reuters) - Portugal's biggest labor group girded for a mass protest rally through central Lisbon on Saturday in the first serious test of government resolve to carry out painful austerity measures. 

 The 725,000-strong Confederation of Portuguese Workers (CGTP) is also leaving open the option of calling a general strike in the coming weeks. Public protest over financial cutbacks imposed on wage earners to cut yawning budget deficits has been muted in Portugal so far compared with elsewhere in the EU, especially the violent unrest seen in debt-hobbled Greece. But the CGTP said Saturday's rally would signal a strategy of escalation driven by outrage over the government's cutbacks. "It's a stage in a continuous struggle that we will intensify. We're leaving all options open, including calling a national general strike," Armenio Carlos, member of CGTP's national leadership committee, told Reuters on Friday. "What we are going to see on Saturday is one of the largest protests in recent years in Portugal, an expression of the sense of indignation and injustice the workers feel over the government's austerity measures," he added. A mass rally by teachers in November 2008 brought together as many as 120,000 protesters in central Lisbon. FIGHTING DEBT CONTAGION The minority Socialist government, with the support of the main opposition party, the Social Democrats (PSD), announced tax increases and spending cuts on May 13. They added to austerity measures such as a freeze on civil servants' wages approved earlier in its medium-term economic program. The plan aims to soothe investor concerns over Portugal's creditworthiness and fight contagion from debt-stricken Greece. It seeks to cut Portgual's budget deficit to 7.3 percent of gross domestic product this year from 2009's high of 9.4 percent, and then gradually to 2.8 percent by 2013. Analysts say the relatively low level of social conflict in Portugal and the PSD's strategy of backing the austerity plan for now mean there is little chance of a government collapse before the next presidential mandate starts in March 2011. "We expect the government will go even further in next year's budget in terms of the sacrifices it forces on the workers, and we want to take a stand against that right now," the CGTP's Carlos said. Unlike what happened in a civil service strike in March, the CGTP rally will not have the support of the second-largest union, the 500,000-strong General Union of Workers (UGT). Traditionally close to the ruling Socialists, the UGT criticised the additional austerity measures but said it would not participate in anti-government protests. The rally does, however, have the backing of the Communist Party, whose no-confidence motion on the government failed in parliament last week, the Left Bloc and the FENPROF teachers' union, which was responsible for the massive rally in 2008.
