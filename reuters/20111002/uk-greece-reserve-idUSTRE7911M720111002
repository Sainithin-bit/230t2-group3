 ATHENS  (Reuters) - The Greek cabinet approved a measure on Sunday to begin reducing the number of state workers, a contentious part of an austerity plan aimed at freeing up EU and IMF loans. 

 The plan creates a "labour reserve" allowing state workers to be placed on partial pay and be dismissed after a year. The government has said it would put 30,000 workers in the reserve by the end of this year. "The labour reserve measure was approved unanimously," a deputy minister who participated in a cabinet meeting told Reuters on condition of anonymity while the cabinet meeting was still under way.
