 PARIS/BERLIN  (Reuters) - France hopes to be able to announce an agreement about a simplified management structure for European defense group EADS at a summit meeting on Monday, but Germany is in no hurry to strike a deal. 

 "We have not finished yet," an official at the Elysee presidential palace said on Sunday. "But we are rather optimistic about the outcome of our discussions with Daimler, Lagardere and the German state," he added. Chancellor Angela Merkel and President Nicolas Sarkozy will meet at the Toulouse headquarters of civil plane maker Airbus. Airbus, once hailed as a European corporate success story, has flown into heavy turbulence because of costly delays to its flagship double-deck A380 while the record high exchange rate of the euro makes Airbus less competitive versus Boeing Airbus plans to slash 10,000 jobs at its own plants and at suppliers, reduce the number of plants and outsource more work outside the euro zone for the new A350 long range wide body jet. France has a 27.38 percent EADS stake and the state is represented on the EADS board by co-chairman Arnaud Lagardere, whose industrial and media group also has an indirect stake. DaimlerChrysler has a stake of some 22.4 percent and provided the other co-chairman, Ruediger Grube. Spanish state holding company SEPI owns 5.5 percent and Russia's state-owned VTB has a 5 percent. Dubai funds DIC and Zabeel have a joint stake of over three percent. French Sunday paper Journal du Dimanche, which is owned by Lagadere, said there could be a French chairman, a German chief executive and a French head of Airbus. "That is a possible scenario but there are other," said the Elysee official. Sarkozy called Merkel on Saturday. A senior German government official said Merkel, conscious to preserve a delicate German-French power balance at EADS, was not in a hurry to conclude a deal. "There is no time pressure," the German official said. ENDERS OR GRUBE The Journal du Dimanche said that Lagardere could remain EADS chairman, and Louis Gallois would relinquish his EADS co-chief executive job and head the subsidiary Airbus. Gallois, however, does not want to have to report to his former German colleague Tom Enders and prefers Grube, the newspaper said. The Elysee official said that the balance and the make-up of the posts was "one of the subjects under discussion but is not necessarily a stumbling block." German weekly Wirtschaftswoche said on Saturday that Merkel was getting worried about the various plans and declarations by Sarkozy. Not only does he want to move fast on EADS, but he has also openly blamed the strong euro for the woes of the group and has urged action from the European Central Bank (ECB). For Merkel ECB independence is sacrosanct and the euro, which hit a record of $1.3815 last week, not a real worry. "All in all -- no," Merkel said when asked by Handelsblatt newspaper if she was worried about the strong euro. "It would be seductive to believe that you could compensate over the long term for the lack of competitiveness of an economy with a soft currency. German exports are cleared in euros and German firms are nevertheless world champions in exports," she said in an interview to be published on Monday. Sarkozy and Merkel will have a first meeting in the morning followed by a lunch with staff and the chief executives in the company restaurant. A joint declaration is expected around 1115 GMT before a second round of bilateral talks in the afternoon. (Additional reporting by  Erik Kirschbaum )
