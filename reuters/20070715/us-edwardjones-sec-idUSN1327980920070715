 Reuters is withdrawing the July 13 story "Edward Jones to pay $75 million in SEC settlement" because the settlement was announced in December 2004. 

 The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission issued an amended administrative order on July 13 which made minor wording changes about where Edward Jones must send its disclosure documents.
