 BERLIN  (Reuters) - The euro zone economy is on a path of stabilization, Germany's Economy Minister Philipp Roesler said on Wednesday, after the government cut its German growth forecast for 2013 to 1 percent, in part due to the currency bloc's debt crisis. 
 "We are on a path of stabilization in the euro zone," Roesler told reporters. "We are still talking about 1 percent growth (for 2013), so there's no talk about a crisis for Germany," he added. (Reporting by  Annika Breidthardt , editing by Gareth Jones)
