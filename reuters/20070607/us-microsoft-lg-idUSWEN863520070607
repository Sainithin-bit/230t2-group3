 SEOUL  (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp. ( MSFT.O ) and South Korea's LG Electronics ( 066570.KS ) said on Thursday they agreed a patent cross-licensing deal, sending LG shares to their highest in more than a year. 

 Under the agreement, LG can use Microsoft-patented technology in its products, including Linux-based embedded devices, while Microsoft will have access to LG's patents and will license other patents developed by the Korean firm. Song Min-ho, analyst at CJ Investment & Securities, noted LG has patents that can be applied to Microsoft's Xbox game console. Shares in LG Electronics rose as much as 5.2 percent to their highest since May 2006, before closing up 3.4 percent at 73,200 won. The main KOSPI index  .KS11  rose 0.62 percent. Analysts said the flat screen and handset maker's stock had already been gaining on the back of recent broker upgrades, but Thursday's sharp gains were triggered by the Microsoft news. No financial details of the deal were disclosed, but analysts predicted it would bring in more revenues for LG Electronics as Microsoft eyes demand for high-data products and services while the line between consumer gadgets and PCs blurs. "This capped four years of negotiations between LG and Microsoft," LG Electronics spokeswoman Judy Pae said. "The amount Microsoft pays LG is much bigger than what LG pays Microsoft, but I can't go into financial details." Cho Sung-eun, analyst at Mirae Asset Securities said: "I expect the agreement could become a big earnings driver for LG Electronics, especially given Microsoft's plans to expand its home networking business in two or three years. It's potentially a huge market. "Given its prominent position in the appliances business, LG could be a major beneficiary from a home networking deal with Microsoft," he added. Analysts said the deal would positively affect LG's patent negotiations with other technology companies and stem a flurry of patent violation lawsuits common in the industry. Greg Roh, an analyst at Korea Investment & Securities, reckons LG Electronics will post second-quarter net profit of 270 billion won ($291.3 million), reversing last year's 9.7 billion won loss and the first quarter's 122.6 billion won net loss. Lehman Brothers and Citigroup, among others, have recently raised their LG earnings forecasts citing improvements in the mobile phones division.
