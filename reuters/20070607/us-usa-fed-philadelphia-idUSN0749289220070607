 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Economic growth will likely pick up modestly in the second half and then return to near-trend growth in the first half of 2008, according to a survey conducted by the Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank. 

 Still, forecasters in the bank's Livingston survey revised their inflation forecasts for 2007 higher and now look for only a small upward drift in the jobless rate this year. Real GDP growth was pegged at a median 2.6 percent in the second half of 2007 versus an earlier forecast of 3.1 percent. From there, growth should rise to 2.9 percent in the first half of 2008. The consumer price index for 2007 was forecast at 2.6 percent, against the previous forecast of 2.1 percent, falling to 2.3 percent in 2008. The forecasters also projected that producer price inflation in 2007 will be 3.2 percent, far above the 1.4 percent predicted six months ago. The U.S. jobless rate was forecast at 4.7 percent by year-end, barely above May's 4.5 percent, and at 4.8 percent by mid-2008. Some economists have said a meaningful rise in the jobless rate is a prerequisite to any move by the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates. The Livingston survey of 39 financial market, academic and corporate economists is conducted twice a year. Responses to the latest version were received on or before May 30. The forecasters called for the U.S. 10-year Treasury note yield US10YT=RR to end the year at 4.95 percent, down from an earlier forecast of 5.05 percent and Wednesday's 5.10 percent. The three-month Treasury bill yield US3MT=RR was forecast at 4.93 percent by year-end versus an earlier estimate of 4.98 percent. The S&P 500 stock index  .SPX  was forecast at 1,557 points by year-end and at 1,635 points by the end of 2008, helped by a continued rise in corporate profits. Both estimates were raised moderately from the December survey. In late trading on Thursday the S&P was at about 1,500 points, down from last week's record high of 1,540.
