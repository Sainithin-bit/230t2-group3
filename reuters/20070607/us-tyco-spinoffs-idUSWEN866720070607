 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Tyco International Ltd. ( TYC.N ) said on Thursday its board has formally approved its separation into three publicly traded companies through a dividend distribution to shareholders. 

 The company said the distributions will be made on June 29, and that each Tyco shareholder will receive one share of Covidien Ltd. and one share of Tyco Electronics for every four shares of Tyco International. Tyco has said it was spinning off its electronics and health-care divisions into independent, publicly traded companies to allow each business to set its own strategy and provide investors with clearer choices. The break-up has been expected to cost $1.6 billion. Tyco also filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday to withdraw the debt offerings that the three entities registered for in connection with the separation. Tyco spokesman Paul Fitzhenry said there was no need for the debt issuances as the company has "debt financing in place to allow us to complete the spin-offs of Covidien and Electronics. "We're moving forward on that basis to complete the separation as planned," Fitzhenry said. In the company's statement, Tyco Chief Executive Edward Breen said, "We are now in the final stages of completing this complex transaction which will provide these businesses with the focus and flexibility to achieve their long-term growth potential." Immediately following the distributions, Tyco International's shareholders will own all of the common shares of Covidien and Tyco Electronics. Covidien and Tyco Electronics plan to list their shares on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbols "COV" ( COV.N ) and "TEL" ( TEL.N ), respectively.
