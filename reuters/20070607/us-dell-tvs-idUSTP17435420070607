 TAIPEI  (Reuters) - Dell Inc. DELL.O is leaving the LCD television business to focus on its core PC products amid an ongoing company overhaul by founder Michael Dell, Taiwan media reported on Thursday. 

 Dell, the world's No.2 personal computer maker, would cease making Dell-branded LCD televisions this month, the Chinese-language Economic Daily reported, citing unnamed sources. A Dell spokeswoman said the company currently sells LCD TVs in a limited number of markets, including Japan and the United States, but had no comment about the Economic Daily report. Dell entered the LCD television market in late 2003, amid a broader wave that also saw cellphone giant Motorola MOT.N enter the sector in a bid to become more diversified providers of consumer electronics. Most of the newcomers bought their TVs from third-party original equipment manufacturers, who then put on the specific company brand names. But many of the non-traditional players have quietly de-emphasized the business since then in favor of focusing on their core products.
