 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc.'s ( QCOM.O ) chief executive said on Thursday that the company would ask the Bush administration to overturn an order by the U.S. International Trade Commission banning some imported cell phone models containing Qualcomm chips and would also seek an emergency stay from a federal appeals court. 

 Qualcomm CEO Paul Jacobs said in a conference call with reporters that the ITC ban in the patent case was "wrong" and that the trade agency had overstepped its bounds. Another company official said Qualcomm was looking for ways to design around the patent at issue, owned by Broadcom Inc.
