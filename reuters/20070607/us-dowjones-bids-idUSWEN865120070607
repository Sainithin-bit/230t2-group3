 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A "Wall Street group" and an Internet entrepreneur have expressed interest in mounting a counterbid to News Corp. NWSa.N chief Rupert Murdoch's $5 billion offer for Dow Jones & Co. Inc. DJ.N, an adviser to the Dow Jones employee union said on Thursday. 

 Ownership Associates founder and President Christopher Mackin declined to identify the entrepreneur or the members of the group. Mackin, an adviser to the union, also declined to say what kind of group it was. Mackin also said Yucaipa Cos., the investment firm run by Los Angeles billionaire investor Ron Burkle, is working with the union, but "has not committed funding or financing." The union also is open to more than one way to structure a union-led buyout of Dow Jones if the opportunity arose, including an employee stock ownership plan, Mackin said. Dow Jones shares were up 8 cents at $60.24 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
