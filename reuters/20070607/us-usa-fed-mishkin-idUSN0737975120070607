 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Federal Reserve Governor Frederic Mishkin said on Thursday the growing use of credit cards has been accompanied by increasingly complicated terms that are a concern for policy-makers. 

 "The board is keenly aware of concerns over the fairness and transparency of card marketing and account terms," Mishkin said in prepared testimony for delivery to a U.S. House of Representatives' Financial Services subcommittee. Not only is there an issue with low introductory rates that can suddenly accelerate, but there is a perception that "the presence in the market of terms unfavorable to consumers appears to some to indicate that the market is not fully competitive." Mishkin's testimony was entirely about credit cards and included no mention of current U.S. economic conditions or interest-rate policy. The Fed has proposed revisions to credit-card disclosures that Mishkin said should help consumers make better decisions because they will be able to see and understand the terms and prices charged by the lenders more clearly. "When that happens, individual consumers are less likely to fall into 'traps for the unwary' and are more able to choose products that offer the best combination of features and pricing to meet their personal financial needs," he said. The Fed's proposed changes to so-called "Regulation Z" rules on disclosure would, among other things, lengthen the period required for notifying a consumer that rates were increasing to 45 days from the current generally required 15 days. Mishkin said that would give a consumer more time to decide whether cheaper credit was available elsewhere or to decide to pay off any remaining balances before the rates increase.
