 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Broadcom Corp. ( BRCM.O ) said on Thursday it is open to discussions for Qualcomm Inc. ( QCOM.O ) to license its technology patent after a government agency banned the U.S. sale of some phones with Qualcomm chips. 

 The U.S. International Trade Commission on Thursday ordered a ban of the U.S. sale of some cell phone models that run on chips designed by Qualcomm that the ITC found infringed on Broadcom patents.
