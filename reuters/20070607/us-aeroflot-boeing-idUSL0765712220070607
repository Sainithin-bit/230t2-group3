 MOSCOW  (Reuters) - Russia's flagship carrier Aeroflot ( AFLT.MM ) will revive a $2 billion deal to buy 22 Boeing ( BA.N ) 787 jets, Kommersant business daily reported on Thursday, citing industry sources. 

 The deal was frozen in 2006 due to what analysts said was worsening political relations between Moscow and Washington. In March, Aeroflot announced plans to buy 22 planes from rival producer Airbus ( EAD.PA ) despite the fact that the first A350 aircraft may be delivered much later than 2010 - a deadline that Boeing said it would be able to meet. Kommersant cited industry sources as saying the deal with Boeing will be revived at Russia's landmark economic forum in St Petersburg on Saturday with Boeing and Aeroflot signing a deal for the delivery of planes. Boeing will also sign a protocol to expand its cooperation with Russia's Sukhoi corporation. The U.S. firm is already consulting Sukhoi on the design, marketing and production of a Sukhoi Superjet regional airliner and will expand its involvement by agreeing to create personnel training and servicing centers. Kommersant quoted industry experts as saying the reversal of Russia's position toward Boeing was politically motivated and follows Moscow's failure to gain a bigger involvement in EADS. Russian state-controlled bank VTB has a five percent stake in EADS, which controls Airbus. France and Germany are EADS's top shareholders.
