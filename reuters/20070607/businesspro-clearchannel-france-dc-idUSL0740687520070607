 PARIS  (Reuters) - Clear Channel Outdoor ( CCU.N ) wants to 
increase its share of the French outdoor advertising market 
where it competes with domestic leader JCDecaux ( JCDX.PA ), the 
head of Clear Channel France told French daily Les Echos in an 
interview published on Thursday. 

  Clear Channel Outdoor notably wants to lift its share of 
the French street furniture market -- advertising on street 
props such as bus shelters or public toilets -- to 50 percent 
within 5 years from a current 32 percent.  JCDecaux has a 57 percent market share.  "We want to reach a 50-50 situation and this target is 
reachable within five years," Hubert Janvier said.  Clear Channel Outdoor has a 28 percent share of the French 
outdoor advertising market against 32 percent for JCDecaux. It 
generates revenue of 350 million euros in France where it 
employs 1,600 people.  Janvier also said Clear Channel had a "solid case" in its 
legal challenge against the award to JCDecaux of a 10-year 
self-service bicycle and street furniture contract with the 
City of Paris. A court hearing is slated for June 19.
