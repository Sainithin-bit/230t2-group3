 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Carlyle Group LP, the private equity firm with $147 billion in assets under management, is planning to sell a 10 percent stake in its upcoming initial public offering, a source familiar with the matter said on Tuesday. 
 The firm, which is set to start road shows for its IPO shortly, first hinted at the size of the sale in a regulatory filing earlier this month. It is looking for a valuation of between $7.5 billion and $8 billion, the source said. A Carlyle spokesman declined to comment. (Reporting by  Greg Roumeliotis  in New York; Editing by  Gary Hill )
