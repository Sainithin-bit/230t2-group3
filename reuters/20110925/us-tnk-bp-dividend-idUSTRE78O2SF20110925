 MOSCOW  (Reuters) - The board of Russia's third-largest oil producer, TNK-BP TNBP.MM, has approved an additional $1.25 billion dividend payout to shareholders, a TNK-BP spokesman said on Sunday. 

 A source familiar with the situation told Reuters the additional payout for the first half of 2011 was approved at a board meeting on Friday. "On top of $4.2 billion already paid this year, it will bring total payments to $5.5 billion," the source said. BP ( BP.L ) owns half of TNK-BP, and the other half is controlled by the Russia-connected consortium AAR. Another source said former BP Chief Executive Tony Hayward had resigned from the TNK-BP board due to other commitments. Since being forced out of BP in the wake of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill, Hayward has taken on a variety of roles executive and non-executive roles, including founding a $4 billion Kurdistan focused exploration vehicle.
