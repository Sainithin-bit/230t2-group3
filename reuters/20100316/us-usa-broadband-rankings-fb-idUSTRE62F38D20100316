 (Reuters) - Regulators have released a plan for upgrading Internet speeds for all Americans, saying the country urgently needs to improve broadband services to compete with the rest of the world. 

 The Federal Communications Commission wants to increase broadband speeds to 100 megabits per second (mbps) by 2020, from an average of about 4 mbps now, and to make 500 megahertz of spectrum available to boost wireless services. Here is how Internet and mobile services in the United States stack up against that of some other developed economies, according to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and U.S. wireless trade group CTIA. ------------------------------------------------------- HIGH-SPEED INTERNET (Source: OECD -June 2009 research) Broadband penetration: Rank Country Subscribers per 100 people 1 Netherlands 38.1 2 Denmark 37.0 3 Norway 34.5 4 Switzerland 33.8 5 Korea 32.8 6 Iceland 32.8 7 Sweden 31.6 8 Luxembourg 31.3 9 Finland 29.7 10 Canada 29.7 11 Germany 29.3 12 France 29.1 13 Britain 28.9 14 Belgium 28.4 15 USA 26.7 Highest advertised Internet speeds: Country Megabits per second Japan 1,000 Finland 110 South Korea/Iceland/France/Sweden 100 Netherlands 60 USA/Spain/Norway/Denmark/Germany 50 Average monthly broadband service fees: Country For low speeds Country For high speeds (in US dollars) (in US dollars) Italy 11.39 Japan 32.44 Denmark 19.53 Sweden 34.51 Belgium 20.64 Korea 37.17 Finland 21.88 Finland 42.47 Ireland 22.05 France 44.18 Britain 22.07 Germany 60.66 Japan 22.38 Denmark 75.86 Sweden 22.46 Iceland 83.43 Netherlands 22.74 Spain 86.83 New Zealand 23.74 Netherlands 109.92 Portugal 24.01 USA 139.95 USA 24.40 Norway 152.68 ------------------------------------------------------- MOBILE (Source: CTIA) Subscribers, commercially assigned wireless spectrum and subscribers served per megahertz of spectrum: Mobile Commercial Subscribers Country Subscribers Spectrum Served per Mhz (millions) (in Megahertz) USA 270.3 409.5 660,073 Japan 110.6 347 314,985 Germany 107.0 305 350,819 Italy 89.9 311.4 288,696 Mexico 79.4 120 661.666 Britain 76.8 352.8 217,687 France 57.5 374.6 154,497 Spain 53.1 358 148,324 S Korea 46.2 233 198,283 Canada 21.7 205 105,853 Additional wireless spectrum in pipeline: Country Potential new spectrum (Mhz) USA 50 Britain 355 Germany 340 Italy 254 Japan 165 Mexico 120 (Reporting by  Sinead Carew ; Editing by  Tim Dobbyn )
