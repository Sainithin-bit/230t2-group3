 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - European Union finance ministers failed on Tuesday to settle their differences over a new law to control hedge funds, a spokeswoman for the bloc's Spanish presidency said. 

 The rules are intended to curb pay and borrowing at hedge funds and usher in an era of transparency for an industry which some politicians say exacerbated Greece's fiscal problems because it bet on the country's debt. But the EU ministers failed at talks in Brussels to resolve a dispute between Britain -- which wants lighter regulation of an industry important for London's financial center -- and Germany and France, which are pushing for a harsher clamp down. "Spanish Finance Minister Elena Salgado said to ministers that much progress had been reached but that more work needed to be done to reach maximum support," said a spokesman for Spain, which chaired the negotiations. Although many experts say the previously unregulated industry needs strict controls following the financial crisis, London fears the rules could force out foreign hedge funds. The law would also have an impact on private equity. The 27-country EU is planning a shake-up of financial services, spanning a squeeze on banker pay to demanding higher reserves of capital for unexpected losses. This would be delayed if the hedge fund stalemate continues. (Additional reporting by  Jan Strupczewski  and  Julien Toyer ; Editing by Ruth Pitchford)
