 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve held benchmark rates near zero on Tuesday and renewed a promise to keep them exceptionally low for an extended period while pointing to increased momentum in the economy's recovery. 

 KEY POINTS: * The central bank's nod to a firmer rebound from the deepest recession in decades hints that it is moving closer to dropping its promise to hold borrowing costs at rock bottom levels, suggesting rate hikes could come within several months. * For a second consecutive meeting, Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank President Thomas Hoenig dissented, saying the commitment to keep rates exceptionally low for an extended period was no longer warranted. * The Fed said the labor market was "stabilizing," a view that was more upbeat than at the last meeting in late January, when the policy-setting committee said only that deterioration in the labor market was "abating." * The central bank reiterated that it intends to wrap up purchases of mortgage-related assets by the end of March, but would monitor the economic outlook and financial developments to see if more support is necessary. COMMENTS: CHRIS RUPKEY, CHIEF FINANCIAL ECONOMIST, BANK OF TOKYO/MITSUBISHI UFJ, NEW YORK: "There's a bit of a relief trade. People thought, 'Rates are at rock bottom; the news can only be bad.' But the Fed did not confirm that fear. They did not alter the 'extended period' language. It took a few minutes to get going, but we had a relief rally." ZACH PANDL, ECONOMIST, NOMURA SECURITIES INTERNATIONAL INC, NEW YORK: "The financial system has healed so the Fed has rightly begun with its exit strategy in terms of pulling out support to distressed parts of the capital market. That sort of exceptional support is no longer needed. "However, unlike the financial system the economy as a whole has not yet healed, so it still requires extremely easy monetary policy. "So the Fed making no major changes here, continues to see only a moderate recovery, and is slightly more positive about the labor market but more negative on the housing sector, so its keeping its options open with the mortgage purchase program in particular. If anything this statement increases our conviction the Fed will remain on hold for the foreseeable future." PETER BOOCKVAR, EQUITY STRATEGIST, MILLER TABAK + CO, NEW YORK "Most importantly within the FOMC statement, they reiterated that the MBS/agency debt portion of will end by March and that the fed funds rate will remain 'exceptionally low' for an 'extended period' just as should have been expected. The Fed likely wants to see how the market responds by month-end to the finish of QE before they alter the wording. If all goes smooth, I believe this wording will change. "Hoenig again dissented and said the wording should go as the policy 'could lead to the buildup of financial imbalances and increase risks to longer run macroeconomic and financial stability.' In other words, let's not repeat the mistake of too low for too long that helped create the credit bubble. The inflation wording was dovish and the same as has been seen and the economic comments were a touch more positive with the same caveats as the Jan comments. Bottom line, today is a non-event but expect a change in April." TOM FITZPATRICK, CHIEF TECHNICAL STRATEGIST AT CITIGROUP, NEW YORK: "The Fed is keeping its cautious stance, highlighting that rates will remain exceptionally low for some time. Overall the Fed is maintaining the status quo, being somewhat dovish. We may see the dollar come off a bit, while Treasury yields drift a bit lower." GARY THAYER, CHIEF MACROSTRATEGIST, WELLS FARGO ADVISORS, ST.LOUIS, MISSOURI: "The Fed is going to continue to hold rates low for an extended period. Concerns that we might be close to a rate hike are pushed back a little bit. They said the labor market is stabilizing. They're not ready to say it's improving." GREG SALVAGGIO, VICE PRESIDENT OF TRADING, TEMPUS CONSULTING, WASHINGTON: "Two things jump out at me. They are pretty bearish about housing. Also, they say employers remain reluctant to add payrolls. Still, it's interesting that Hoenig keeps dissenting. So perhaps we're starting to see a bit of a hawkish streak start to develop within the Fed. By that I mean they may push up the rate to half a percent sometime this year. But they'll be cautious until we see some payroll growth. The dollar is selling off a little bit here on the dovish commentary about the labor and housing markets. I don't think the market expected them to say housing is still at depressed levels and employers are still reluctant to add to payrolls. But we're not expecting the euro to break out of its $1.35-$1.38 range on the back of this." WAYNE KAUFMAN, CHIEF MARKET ANALYST, JOHN THOMAS FINANCIAL, NEW YORK: "This was completely, 100 percent expected by the market without a hitch. Absolutely zero surprise, and I'd be surprised if anyone was surprised. Everyone knew what was coming, and the only thing people were looking for was to see if there would be a change in some of the wording. "The markets may need to digest some of the gains we've had lately because it's overbought, but I'm not expecting a dip on this. There are no sellers, and no catalyst for a sell-off." ASHRAF LAIDI, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, CMC MARKETS, LONDON. "Both interest rates remain unchanged at the same level of dissent with Hoenig being the sole dissenter against the Fed's dovish view with respect to low interest rates for an extended period. This explains the knee jerk reaction against the U.S. dollar which we only expect to be short-lived, partly due to anticipation of tightening from China in the form of higher interest rates which could come as early as this month." JIM AWAD, MANAGING DIRECTOR AT ZEPHYR MANAGEMENT, NEW YORK: "The markets wanted to be reassured that the Fed would keep rates steady until employment starts to grow, so this is what was expected. The markets should view it as a positive."
