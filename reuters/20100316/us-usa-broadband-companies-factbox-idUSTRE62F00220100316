 (Reuters) - The Federal Communications Commission released its National Broadband Plan, a roadmap to faster and more widespread broadband access over the next decade. The five members of the FCC are due to discuss the plan at an open meeting on Tuesday. 

 The following are some potential winners and losers compiled from analyst reports by Concept Capital and Stifel Nicolaus: UNIVERSAL SERVICE * Large telecommunications companies like Verizon Communications Inc, AT&T Inc and Qwest Communications International Inc could pay less to rural carriers under proposed changes to the Universal Service Fund * Rural carriers such as Windstream Corp, Frontier Communications Corp and CenturyTel Inc that rely on intercarrier compensation for connecting long-distance calls could see lower revenues under the Universal Service Fund proposals SPECTRUM SHIFT * Wireless companies such as Verizon Wireless, AT&T, Sprint Nextel Corp and Deutsche Telekom AG's T-Mobile USA unit are widely expected to benefit from the long-term plan to reallocate of 500 megahertz of spectrum from licensees such as broadcasters * T-Mobile, seeking even more spectrum to compete with its bigger rivals, could benefit further if the FCC places a spectrum cap on the biggest carriers, Verizon and AT&T * Broadcast TV stations could receive money under a plan by the FCC to auction some of their airwaves for wireless companies. Possible beneficiaries include: CBS Corp, Sinclair Broadcast Group Inc, LIN TV Corp, Gray Television Inc, Belo Corp, Media General Inc Keywords: USA BROADBAND/COMPANIES WIRELESS INFRASTRUCTURE * Spectrum sharing would require complex engineering that could benefit: Alcatel-Lucent, a French-American maker of telecommunications gear CommScope Inc, a communications cable maker Ciena Corp, a telecommunications network equipment maker Tellabs Inc, a telecommunications equipment supplier to major phone companies Alvarion Ltd, an Israeli maker of WiMax and wireless broadband equipment Qualcomm Inc, a wireless chip maker SBA Communications, Crown Castle International Corp and American Tower Corp, wireless tower operators Keywords: USA BROADBAND/COMPANIES
