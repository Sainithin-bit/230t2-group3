 DETROIT  (Reuters) - The United Auto Workers union is looking for "the same things" in its new labor contract with Ford Motor Co. ( F.N ) as it did with General Motors Corp ( GM.N ) and Chrysler LLC, the UAW's chief negotiator for Ford said on Monday. 

 "We are looking for the same things," Bob King told Reuters on the sidelines of an event that celebrated the launch of the redesigned Ford Focus car. "We are looking for investment in product, healthcare for retirees," King said.
