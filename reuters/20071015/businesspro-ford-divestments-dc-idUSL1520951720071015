 MADRID  (Reuters) - Ford ( F.N ) expects to sell its Jaguar 
and Land Rover UK premium brands in the next two months but 
does not expect to sell them separately, the head of Ford 
Europe, John Fleming, was quoted as saying on Monday. 

  "We are well on and in two months at the most we'll know 
which of the groups interested in the brands will be their new 
owner," Fleming told Spanish newspaper El Mundo.  Fleming also said Ford was still analyzing how the sale of 
its Volvo brand might affect the firm.  Ford has been exploring the possible sale of Land Rover and 
Jaguar since June as it continues the strategic review of its 
global operations. It sold Aston Martin in March.  Last week, people familiar with the matter said bids for 
the luxury brands could land around the end of October or the 
beginning of November. Potential bidders include buyout firms 
One Equity Partners, Ripplewood, Terra Firma and TPG TPG.UL, 
as well as Indian carmaker Tata Motors ( TAMO.BO ).  Asked if the two brands could be sold to two bidders, the 
newspaper quoted Fleming as saying: "No, not really. They are 
both very integrated and it would be difficult to sell them 
separately."  Fleming said Ford was still in the process of a strategic 
review of what it should do with Swedish brand Volvo.  "Volvo is a fundamental partner in the development of 
safety and environmental technology. It would be very dangerous 
to hand it over to a competitor," he said.
