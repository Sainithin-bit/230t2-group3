 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The consortium that agreed to buy student lender Sallie Mae SLM.N for $25 billion said on Monday it has offered to terminate the transaction. 

 The buyer group led by private equity firm J.C. Flowers & Co said it has asked a court to declare that it is not obligated to proceed with the deal. The consortium released a letter sent to Vice Chancellor Leo E. Strine, Jr. of Delaware Chancery Court offering to terminate the $60-a-share leveraged buyout of Sallie Mae, formally known as SLM Corp. Sallie Mae shares were down $2.47 or about 5 percent to $45.98 in Monday afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The group said its move was in response to a letter that Sallie Mae sent to the court on Friday asking for an expedited trial. The consortium said it offered to terminate the merger agreement in response to Sallie Mae's assertion on Friday that the agreement is impeding the student lender's ability to run its business. "The letter explains that by entering into an agreement to terminate the merger agreement, Sallie Mae would be free from the restrictions that it is complaining about," the consortium said in a statement. Sallie Mae has filed a lawsuit seeking a breakup fee of $900 million from the consortium of private equity firms J.C. Flowers and Friedman Fleischer and Lowe and major banks JPMorgan Chase & Co ( JPM.N ) and Bank of America Corp ( BAC.N ). COUNTERCLAIMS The buyer group said it also filed its counterclaims with the Delaware Chancery Court. The consortium argues Sallie Mae has suffered a "material adverse change" to its business due to a serious credit market squeeze and legislation that slashes subsidies to student lenders, but Sallie Mae disagrees. "The buyer's filings are simply another effort to confuse events," said a spokesman for Sallie Mae on Monday. "Consistent with our recent statements and court filings, there has been no material adverse effect. "The buyer group's misstatements attempt to mask a simple fact -- that the buyer's group is obligated to honor the contract they signed, and pay $60 per share. If they fail to do so, they will be liable for the termination fee." The student lender's lawsuit seeks a declaration that the buyer group has reneged on the original merger agreement; that no material adverse change has occurred; and that Sallie Mae may terminate the takeover and collect the $900 million. The original buyout has a $900 million breakup fee. But if the consortium could prove Sallie Mae suffered a material adverse change, it would not have to pay the fee. The consortium agreed in April to pay $60 a share for Sallie Mae, but later proposed to cut its price to $50 a share plus extra payments depending on how the company performed, citing the credit market squeeze and the legislation. Sallie Mae has said that the buyers should stick to the original agreement and that the revised $50-a-share proposal has since expired.
