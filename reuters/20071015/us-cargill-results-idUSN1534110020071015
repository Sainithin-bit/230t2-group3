 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - U.S. agribusiness Cargill Inc CARG.UL on Monday said first-quarter net earnings rose 83 percent, led by its origination and processing segment which processes, markets and distributes agricultural commodities. 

 Minneapolis-based Cargill, a private company that provides food, agricultural and trading services, said net earnings in the quarter ended August 31 rose to $917 million from $500 million a year earlier. "June through August was an extraordinary period, with growing demand for agricultural commodities against tightening supplies and a long-anticipated but dramatic reduction in liquidity and leverage in financial markets," Cargill CEO Greg Page said in a statement. Cargill's food ingredients and applications and industrial segments also outperformed last year's earnings. Results at the agricultural services segment were slightly ahead of year-ago figures while results at the risk-management and financial segment were below year-ago levels. During the quarter Cargill began purchasing the remaining shares of Agrograin, a Hungarian grain company in which it bought a minority interest and formed a joint venture in 1995. Cargill also announced plans to double the capacity of its canola processing plant in Clavet, Saskatchewan.
