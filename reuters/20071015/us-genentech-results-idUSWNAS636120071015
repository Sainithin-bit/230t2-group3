 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Genentech Inc DNA.N reported higher third-quarter profit on Monday, helped by increased sales of its Avastin cancer medicine and other drugs. 

 The world's second-largest biotechnology company by sales posted a net profit of $685 million, or 64 cents per share, compared with a profit of $568 million, or 53 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, Genentech earned 73 cents per share, slightly beating analysts' average expectation of 72 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Shares in the company, which in July said it expected full-year earnings per share to grow 28 percent to 32 percent, have fallen more than 4 percent this year. By comparison, the American Stock Exchange Biotech Index .BTK is up about 13 percent for the year. (Reporting by  Bill Berkrot )
