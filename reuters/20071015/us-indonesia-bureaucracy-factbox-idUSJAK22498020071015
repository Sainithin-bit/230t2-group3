 (Reuters) - The World Bank has urged Indonesia to cut red tape and tackle corruption and labor laws to attract foreign direct investment which would create more jobs and accelerate economic growth in Southeast Asia's biggest economy. 

 Below are details about doing business in Indonesia: - Indonesia ranks 123rd out of 178 countries in the latest World Bank survey in terms of ease of doing business. Its overall ranking has improved since the previous year, when it was 135th out of 175, thanks to faster processing of certain types of permits and improved protection for investors. - Indonesia ranks worst in Asia in terms of how long it takes to start up a business. It takes 105 days, longer than in the previous year when it took 97 days, and considerably longer than Singapore, where it takes just five days. - Key areas that Jakarta needs to address include allowing companies to apply for permits and licenses simultaneously rather than one after the other, which takes longer, and streamlining the various redundant or overlapping licenses, the World Bank says. - Jakarta needs to pass a cyberlaw to allow paperless approvals and licensing, as well as a law on special economic zones, the World Bank adds.
