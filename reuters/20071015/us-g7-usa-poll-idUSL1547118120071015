 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Economists see a 30 percent chance of a U.S. recession next year thanks to persistent weakness in housing that will probably push the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates again this year, according to a Reuters poll. 

 However, a survey taken Oct 9-12 showed a slight upgrade in growth forecasts for this year compared with a month ago and only 50 basis points more left for the Fed to cut after slashing rates to 4.75 percent in September. The chances of recession have barely moved over the past month, at about 30 percent, and fare significantly better than former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's recent public prognostications that the odds are less than 50-50. U.S. policymakers will need to keep one eye on sluggish growth and the soft labor market while also watching for any pick-up in price pressures as a result of the falling dollar, economists said. "The weak dollar and elevated food and energy prices will add to inflation pressures," said Scott Brown at Raymond James & Associates in St. Petersburg, Florida. "However, overall economic growth will remain below potential in the near term, keeping overall inflation pressures balanced, which should allow the Fed to lower rates in December," he said. The Fed cut its benchmark interest rate by a half-percentage point last month, to 4.75 percent, to lessen the impact on the economy from rising mortgage defaults, falling house prices and tight lending conditions in global money markets. A crisis that began in the market for mortgages to risky borrowers this summer has since spread to other areas of financial markets, hurting companies' ability to raise short-term capital for everyday transactions. "A deepening credit crunch will likely keep GDP growth below trend, with recession a significant risk," said Ethan Harris with Lehman Brothers in New York. In the poll, economists expect growth to ease to 1.7 percent in the fourth quarter, according to the median of 75 forecasts, but then recover to 2.8 percent in the final quarter of 2008. They saw full-year GDP growth at 2.2 percent this year and 2.4 percent in 2008. The 2007 forecast is up one tenth of a percentage point since a similar monthly poll in September, while the 2008 forecast is revised down by the same amount. The U.S. economy grew at a 4 percent annualized rate in the second quarter of this year. NOT MUCH LEFT TO CUT The Fed is seen cutting rates by a quarter-percentage point to 4.50 percent by the end of 2007 and then once again to 4.25 percent by the end of the first quarter of 2008, the poll showed, only to raise them to 4.50 percent by end 2008. Sixty five of 107 economists forecast rates at 4.50 percent by end-year, with 27 saying rates will fall to 4.25 percent or lower and the remaining 15 saying they will remain steady. For end-March, 41 of 107 said rates would be at 4.50 percent, 41 said they would be at 4.25 percent, with 14 forecasting rates at 4.0 percent or lower. Eleven economists said rates would be at their current 4.75 percent. The threat of rising prices will probably be a thorn in the side of the U.S. central bank, with underlying inflation remaining just above 2 percent, which is considered to be the upper end of the comfort zone of some Fed officials. Core inflation, which the Fed tends to focus on because it excludes volatile food and energy costs, will be 2.3 percent in 2007 and then ease a bit to 2.1 percent in 2008, according to the median of the Reuters poll. That is unchanged from the September poll. Though the U.S. employment picture improved somewhat since the September jobs report showed employers added 110,000 new workers to their payrolls, economists still expect the unemployment rate to pick up from 4.6 percent in 2007 to 5.0 percent in 2008.
