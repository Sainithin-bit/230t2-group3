 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - British entrepreneur Richard Branson, founder of the Virgin Group known for its airline and music stores, launched a U.S. company on Monday that manages consumer loans between friends and family. 

 Virgin Money USA is opening when U.S. credit markets are turbulent and borrowers are having a harder time getting loans approved by banks and other financial institutions. "This is very timely because of what's happening in the U.S. credit markets," Asheesh Advani, chief executive of Virgin Money USA, told Reuters. "Banks in general are tightening up, so this is a wonderful alternative for people who are looking to seek a loan." A U.S. credit crisis emanating from subprime mortgages rippled through financial markets this summer. Banks and other institutions have become much more stringent in doling out loans as defaults and foreclosures mount. Virgin Money, the parent company's financial services arm, already operates in the U.K, Australia and South Africa. Branson "is motivated by shaking things up and finding a better deal for the consumer," Advani said. "The Virgin Money proposition will be very much about creating loans and mortgages that fit you and that help you keep money in the family as opposed to giving it to a bank." Virgin in August exported Virgin America Inc. and spurred a domestic fare war in the long embattled U.S. air industry. Thursday, Virgin Mobile USA Inc VM.N, a joint venture of Virgin Group VA.UL and Sprint Nextel Corp ( S.N ), raised $412.5 million in an initial public offering. The pay-as-you-go mobile service provider focuses on the youth market. Waltham, Massachusetts-based Virgin Money USA manages loans between relatives and friends for a one-time start fee, such as $699 for a mortgage or $100 for various consumer loans, and then $9.99 each month. Virgin USA, Branson's North American investment group, in May acquired a majority stake in CircleLending Inc., which managed loans between friends and family. Advani was CEO of CircleLending, which has now become Virgin Money USA. Advani said "they've capitalized the company with quite a bit more money, more money than we've raised in the past, and we'll be using that to create new financial products." A student loan product is in the 2008 queue, he said. Specific terms of the Virgin deal with CircleLending are not being disclosed, a Virgin Money USA spokeswoman said. A consortium led by Virgin Group aims to rescue troubled mortgage bank Northern Rock NRK.L, which a month ago received emergency funding by the Bank of England, Branson's company said on Friday.
