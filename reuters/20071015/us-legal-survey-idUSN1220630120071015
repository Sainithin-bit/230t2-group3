 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. companies are getting hit with fewer new lawsuits and initiating less litigation, according to a survey released on Monday. 

 The poll of in-house law departments suggests corporate litigation may have slowed, although big companies still find themselves juggling plenty of court cases, particularly patent and product liability disputes. The fourth annual survey of in-house counsel at 250 major U.S. companies, was commissioned by law firm Fulbright & Jaworski LLP. The survey found 17 percent of respondents said their companies have not had to defend against any new lawsuits this year -- such as those filed by employees, consumers, shareholders, competitors or enforcement agencies -- up from 11 percent a year earlier that did not face a single new suit. Sixty-five percent of respondents said their company had initiated at least one lawsuit in the past year, down from more than 70 percent a year ago and 88 percent in 2004. Twenty-two percent said they expect to see the number of legal disputes their companies face increase over the next 12 months, compared with 33 percent last year, the survey found. The data "point to a pronounced drop in new case filings -- both against, and by American companies, a reversal of the upward trajectory in the number of new lawsuits from our previous three surveys," said Stephen Dillard, chair of Fulbright's global litigation practice. Sixty-four percent of the companies in the survey were publicly held. Internal investigations into matters such as stock options award practices are still preoccupying many companies -- though not as much as last year, the poll found. Fifty-four percent of respondents said their companies have launched an internal probe during the year requiring help from outside lawyers, down from a year earlier, when 63 percent of in-house counsel reported opening such an investigation. Dillard said stable economic conditions in the first half of 2007 likely reduced the number of disputes involving public companies, including securities class actions and other types of investor lawsuits. Other recent studies also suggest the number of new securities class-action filings is on the decline. Academic experts say there is no clear reason for the trend. Not all litigation is declining. Patent cases and product liability lawsuits, for example, are a growing issue, particularly at large companies, the survey found. For U.S. companies with $1 billion or more in annual revenue, patent and intellectual property disputes were cited as the top near-term litigation concern. The survey also found that a third of corporate law departments count more than 25 lawsuits facing their companies at any one time, with 18 percent dealing with at least 100 simultaneous legal actions in U.S. courts.
