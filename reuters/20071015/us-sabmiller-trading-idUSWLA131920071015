 LONDON  (Reuters) - Global brewing giant SABMiller Plc said on Monday its half-year worldwide underlying beer volumes rose 11 percent, but it showed a sharp slowdown in one of its most profitable regions, Latin America. 

 The world's number two brewer and maker of Miller Lite, Peroni, Castle and Chinese Snow beers said growth in its half year (April-Sept) was similar to the 11 percent in the five months to end-August, but down from its first first-quarter (April-June) rise of 13 percent. SABMiller, which last week agreed with Molson Coors to combine their U.S. operations in a venture to be called MillerCoors, added growth in revenue was partially offset by higher input costs, such as barley, glass and aluminum, and increases in investment across the business. "Although overall growth remains strong there has been quite a sharp slowdown in some of the more profitable regions (notably Latin America), and the issue of rising input costs and higher investment levels persists," said Cazenove analyst Matthew Webb. Latin America, which earns a quarter of group profits after the company bought Bavaria in October 2005, reported half-year volumes rose 8 percent, after a first-quarter 12 percent rise, implying 4 percent growth in the second quarter, analysts said. Its biggest Latin American market, Colombia, saw volumes up 7 percent with slower growth in the latter part of the half-year, while in its second largest regional market, Peru, volumes were up 10 percent, hit by cold weather and an earthquake this year. Europe also showed a slowdown with half-year volumes up 12 percent driven by Russia, Poland and Romania after a 17 percent first-quarter rise. Europe makes a fifth of group profits from beers such as Polish Tyskie and Romanian Ursus. In North America, Miller showed further signs of recovery with half-year sales to retailers up 1.4 percent after a 1.3 percent rise in the five months to end-August and a 0.7 percent first-quarter fall. Miller Lite sales were up 2.1 percent. Its Africa and Asia beer volumes rose 20 percent after a first-quarter rise of 23 percent, while in South Africa -- its biggest profit centre with 33 percent of group earnings -- volumes rose 2 percent after a first-quarter rise of 4 percent. The London-based brewer and added its financial performance was in line with its own expectations.
