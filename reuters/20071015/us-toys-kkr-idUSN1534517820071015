 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Toys "R" Us co-owner Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co faced a protest by about two dozen people outside its office here on Monday, urging the private equity giant to get rid of lead-tainted toys. 

 The protest at the start of the key holiday season came as the U.S. toy industry faces scrutiny after global recalls of over 20 million toys made in China over the past three months for excessive lead paint levels that sparked safety concerns. Private equity firms have also come under pressure from union groups and activists in the United States and Europe over concerns that the industry's two-year takeover wave came at the cost of domestic jobs. The KKR protest centered on products, with protesters, including mothers, watchdog groups and city officials, questioning why recalls were still persisting. "Why is it that it's October and last week another toy was recalled from the shelves of Toys "R" Us?" said Emily McKhann, chief executive of The Motherhood, a nonprofit organization for mothers. Nonprofit group Center for Environmental Health last week found a Curious George doll bought from Toys "R" Us to be tainted with 10 times the legally allowed level of lead. The protest group tried to enter KKR's Manhattan office building to give the company a written code to improve product safety. Security guards turned the demonstrators away without incident. KKR and Toys "R" Us did not immediately return calls seeking comment. Editor-in-chief of Toy Wishes magazine Jim Silver expects no major outcome from the demonstration. "Safety standards have already been put in place. Even more are being put in place. I don't think a protest like this is going to affect what is already being done," Silver said. Toys "R" Us has already said it would step up the frequency of its safety checks on products, and expand efforts to inform shoppers of the latest recalls. KKR, along with Bain Capital and Vornado Realty Trust, owns Toys "R" Us, and recently acquired Dollar General. Both retail companies have recalled different products such as vinyl bibs and key chains this year. Protesters blamed KKR of putting profits ahead of safety. "(Our children's) health is not for sale," said New York City council member Melissa Mark-Viverito. "This is not about a bottom-line. This is not about an additional dollar for the shareholder." Also under pressure is the world's largest toy company, Mattel Inc, which missed Wall Street's earnings estimates on Monday after taking charges from the recent toy recalls. Monday's complaints came ahead of a critical sales period for consumer and retail companies that poses safety worries for parents. "You don't want to know that the gift that grandma gave you all of a sudden got recalled," said Flora Huang, a mother who was part of the protest.
