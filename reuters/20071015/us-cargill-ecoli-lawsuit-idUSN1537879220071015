 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - U.S. agribusiness Cargill Inc is being sued by a Minnesota family whose two children suffered E. coli infections after consuming the company's frozen ground beef products, the family's attorney, William Marler, said on Monday. 

 Cargill said it had no comment on the lawsuit at this time, said spokesman Mark Klein. Earlier this month, Cargill recalled 844,812 lbs of frozen beef patties due to possible E. coli contamination after investigators found four cases of illness linked to meat prepared by Cargill and sold by a division of Wal-Mart Stores Inc in Minnesota.  Symptoms of E. coli 0157:H7 illness -- the strain associated with the recall -- include potentially severe stomach cramps and diarrhea.
