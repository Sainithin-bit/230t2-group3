 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Industrial conglomerate Danaher Corp ( DHR.N ) said on Monday it agreed to buy electronic testing company Tektronix Inc TEK.N for $2.8 billion to expand its product line. 

 Danaher, which also raised its third-quarter profit forecast, said it would pay $38 a share for Tektronix, a premium of 34 percent to Friday's closing price of $28.34 on the New York Stock Exchange. The deal, approved by Tektronix's board, is expected to close in the current quarter. The deal would constitute a "fundamental change" under the terms of some Tektronix notes, allowing note holders to convert their notes into cash, the companies said. Tektronix's shares surged almost 33 percent, while Danaher's stock was off over 1 percent in late morning trading. "It makes good sense for Danaher because it gives them increased exposure to the Asia Pacific market, which is rapidly growing," Morningstar analyst Tom D'Amore said, citing the marriage of Tektronix's top technology with Danaher's manufacturing efficiency. D'Amore said the premium Danaher paid for Beaverton, Oregon-based Tektronix was significant, but not exorbitant. Tektronix, with annual revenue of $1.1 billion, would become part of Danaher's electronic test platform, joining Danaher's Fluke and Fluke Networks businesses, and nearly doubling that area's revenue. Tektronix focuses on equipment for engineers in such industries as communications, computers, consumer electronics and education. Danaher Chief Executive Lawrence Culp called Tektronix "just a great fit" and said it would double the company's electronic testing presence in China and India. "Tek has the No. 1 position in over 80 percent of its revenue base," Culp told analysts on a conference call. Washington-based Danaher expects the deal to have no material effect on 2008 earnings, excluding one-time items. It expects Tektronix to boost earnings per share 8 to 10 cents in 2009 and 15 to 20 cents in 2010. Danaher -- with a portfolio also including tools, dental equipment and product-identification technology -- expects to see $40 million in savings from the deal in the first year through cost cuts, lower buying costs and higher manufacturing efficiency at Tektronix. Danaher expects third-quarter earnings before one-time items to be at or slightly above the high end of its previous forecast of 92 to 97 cents a share. Analysts have been expecting 97 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Danaher's forecast excludes about 4 cents a share from favorable tax items and an expected lower tax rate. Tektronix's stock was up $9.31 at $37.65, while Danaher was off 97 cents at $81.50 in New York Stock Exchange trading. (Additional reporting by  Dane Hamilton  in New York, editing by Gerald E.
