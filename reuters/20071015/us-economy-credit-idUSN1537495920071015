 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Top Wall Street banks said on Monday they were creating a huge fund to prevent a fire sale of billions of dollars of shaky debt assets, which helped ease money market rates. 

 The consortium of banks, which includes Citigroup ( C.N ), Bank of America Corp ( BAC.N ) and JPMorgan Chase ( JPM.N ), may pool about $80 billion to buy complex investment vehicles that have had trouble refinancing their debt. The so-called structured investment vehicles (SIVs) owned bonds linked to subprime mortgages and other types of debt. The plan aims to prevent the funds from a forced-sale of assets that could cause billions of dollars in losses on mortgage-related securities and send chills through the financial markets. In the high-yield market, bankers continued to work through a logjam of more than $300 billion in unsold debt for leveraged buyouts announced earlier this year. TXU Corp., First Data Corp. and Bausch & Lomb BOL.N were all marketing bonds on Monday to help finance LBOs, taking advantage of a recent recovery in appetite for high-yield debt. Another LBO, however, was in doubt as the consortium that agreed to buy student lender Sallie Mae SLM.N for $25 billion said it has offered to terminate the transaction. Dealing with a backlog of pending LBO debt is crucial for banks such as Citigroup, which reported a 57 percent drop in third-quarter profit on Monday as its losses from leveraged loans and subprime mortgages mounted. Citigroup and other banks that committed financings for LBOs have had to sell debt at a loss after the credit crunch dried up investor demand for riskier securities. Citigroup is an underwriter for the First Data, TXU and Bausch & Lomb financings. Citigroup-sponsored vehicles were major players in the SIV market, holding some $100 billion of SIV assets at the end of August. SIVs bought assets such as mortgage securities from banks and financed their purchases with medium-term notes and commercial paper. Refinancing commercial paper became more difficult in recent months when the credit squeeze spilled over to that market. News that U.S. banks were joining to prop up the battered SIV and commercial paper markets helped money markets continue to stabilize in Europe, pushing euro-zone lending rates to two-month lows. London interbank deposit rates for three-month euros were fixed at 4.65438 percent compared with 4.68375 percent on Friday. Borrowing rates in the U.S. short-term debt markets remain broadly high, however, given where the Federal Reserve has set short-term rates. The gap between the target federal funds rate and the three-month London interbank offered rate is running just below half a percentage point, down from more than 0.96 at the peak of the credit crunch in August. Before the crisis, the spread between fed funds and Libor had ranged from 0.08 to 0.2 percentage point. The Federal Reserve on Monday continued to add liquidity to the banking system, pumping $14.75 billion in temporary reserves through overnight repurchase agreements. Sallie Mae's struggling deal, meanwhile, provided fresh evidence that the buyout market has not returned to health. Sallie Mae's buyer group, led by private equity firm J.C. Flowers & Co., said it has asked a court to declare it is not obligated to proceed with the deal. The buyer group had agreed in April to pay $60 a share for Sallie Mae but later proposed cutting the price in the wake of the credit squeeze and legislation trimming subsidies to student lenders. Sallie Mae has filed a lawsuit seeking a breakup fee of $900 million from the consortium of private equity firms J.C. Flowers and Friedman Fleischer and Lowe and major banks JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America Corp.
