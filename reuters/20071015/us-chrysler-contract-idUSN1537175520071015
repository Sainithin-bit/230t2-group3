 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Local leaders of the United Auto Workers union on Monday voted to recommend approval of a new four-year contract with automaker Chrysler LLC, although the support was not unanimous. 

 The union said its Chrysler Council, which represents union locals across the United States, had voted "overwhelmingly" to recommend that 48,000 active workers approve the deal. UAW local leaders representing General Motors Corp. ( GM.N ) had earlier voted unanimously to recommend approval of that contract, and the union's statement on Chrysler acknowledged some union leaders were unhappy with aspects of the contract. "We're a democratic union," UAW President Ron Gettelfinger told reporters after a morning meeting in Detroit to brief union local leaders on the tentative agreement reached last week with Chrysler. Gettelfinger said the union would begin ratification meetings at union locals this week.
