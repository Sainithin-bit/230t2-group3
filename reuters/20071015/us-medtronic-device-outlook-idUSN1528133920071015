 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Medtronic Inc ( MDT.N ) said on Monday that its move to suspend sales of a heart device would hurt revenue by $150 million to $250 million in the second quarter. 

 The company, commenting on a conference call with investors, also forecast inventory write-offs of about $15 million to $20 million and $10 million to $20 million in other costs tied to the suspension of distribution of the Sprint Fidelis family of defibrillator leads.
