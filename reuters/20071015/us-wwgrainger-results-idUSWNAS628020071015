 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Building maintenance company W.W. Grainger Inc ( GWW.N ) said on Monday that quarterly net profit rose on higher sales in its international branch-based business and growth initiatives in the United States. 

 The Chicago-based company also raised its full-year earnings outlook, with Chief Executive Richard Keyser citing its "strong performance to date" in 2007. Third-quarter net income rose to $109.2 million, or $1.29 a share, from $104.5 million, or $1.16 a share, a year earlier. Wall Street analysts, on average, had expected earnings of $1.26 per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Sales at Grainger's branch-based business in the United States, Mexico and China rose 9 percent. The company said an estimated 4 percentage points came from two growth initiatives in the United States, market expansion and product line expansion. Grainger also said sales growth had been reduced by approximately one percentage point due as the company continues to exit remaining low-margin contracts. Sales rose to $1.66 billion from $1.52 billion a year earlier. Analysts had expected revenue to reach $1.64 billion. For the full-year, Grainger said it expected earnings of $4.85 to $4.95 per share, up from its previous forecast of $4.75 to $4.90. Analysts were expecting $4.91. In very light trading before the market opened, Grainger shares rose 3 percent to $97 from their New York Stock Exchange close of $94.22. (Reporting by  Nick Carey )
