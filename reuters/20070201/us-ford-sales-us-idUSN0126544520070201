 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co. ( F.N ) on Thursday said U.S. January vehicle sales fell 19 percent from a year earlier because of reduced sales to daily-rental companies. 


 The second-largest U.S. automaker said it sold 166,835 vehicles in the United States last month, compared with 205,671 vehicles a year earlier. Sales to daily-rental companies were down 65 percent, while sales to retail customers were down 5 percent, the company said. Results for Ford include its import brands and some medium- and heavy-duty trucks and are not adjusted for the extra selling day in January 2007.
