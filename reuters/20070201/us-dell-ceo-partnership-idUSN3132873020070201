 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - The return of Michael Dell as chief executive of the company he founded ends a decade-long partnership and unusual shared leadership structure between Dell and the man he replaced, Kevin Rollins. 


 The shake-up on Wednesday also puts the founder squarely back into the limelight as pressure grows for him to innovate his way back to the top of the heap in personal computers. Dell famously began computer maker Dell Inc. in his college dorm room in 1984, but for about the last decade he and Rollins ran the Round Rock, Texas-based company as a team. "Our leadership approach works because we see our roles as partners, we execute our responsibilities as friends, and we share a dedication to making Dell the best company in the world," Dell said when he handed over the top management role to Rollins in 2004. "To a great extent, we've learned together along the way," Rollins once told the Austin Statesman. The two famously had offices on either side of a glass wall with an always-open door, and Rollins said they had negotiated his first contract while jogging together in Paris. Rollins, 54, joined Dell in 1996 from management consultancy Bain & Co., and the 41-year-old Dell called him a "great business partner and friend" in a statement announcing Rollins' departure. But Dell has always overshadowed his older protege. He wrote the business guide "Direct from Dell" and has always stayed chairman of the company. The statement announcing Rollins would go lauded Michael Dell's vision as "critical to building Dell's leadership." Rollins, by contrast, even lacks his own entry in online encyclopedia Wikipedia. While investors were clearly cheered by the return of Dell, sending the stock up nearly 5 percent in after-hours trade, some analysts were more wary. While rival Hewlett-Packard Co. has seized the No. 1 global PC maker title, selling machines on the Internet and through retailers around the world, Dell has stuck to its model of selling directly and takes flak over poor customer service. "From our perspective, the things that they did to get them here may not be the things they need to get them to grow double-digits for the next 10 years. It will depend on how successfully Michael Dell innovates," said Robert W. Baird analyst Daniel Renouard. "Will he be willing to do things differently?"
