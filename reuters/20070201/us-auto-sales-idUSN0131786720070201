 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp. ( 7203.T ) posted a rise in January U.S. auto sales on Thursday, claiming the No. 2 spot in the world's largest market for cars and trucks, as sales by rival Ford Motor Co. ( F.N ) fell sharply. 


 Top carmaker General Motors Corp. ( GM.N ), meanwhile, posted a sales decline at the low end of analysts' expectations and trimmed its first-quarter production plans in response. The shifting fortunes of Toyota and its largest American rivals had been widely expected, given Toyota's momentum with a line-up of fuel-efficient cars and the sweeping restructuring efforts underway at Ford and GM. It was not the first month that Toyota had surpassed Ford but gave the Japanese automaker a lead in a year in which many analysts expect it will top Ford in annual U.S. sales and overtake GM on a global basis. Toyota's U.S. sales rose 9.5 percent in January before adjusting for the number of selling days in the month. On the same basis, Ford's sales dropped 19 percent. GM, which remains the industry sales leader, posted a 16.4 percent sales decline on an unadjusted basis, or 20 percent on an adjusted basis. Final sales numbers were not immediately available but analysts said they expected industrywide sales to have dropped by 5 percent or more, reflecting less aggressive discounting, a weaker U.S. housing market and relatively high interest rates. "We've hit a point where the consumer is strained and I think we're in a position where the industry is going to downshift and stay there," said Global Insight analyst George Magliano. Other major automakers reported sales gains for January. DaimlerChrysler AG'sDCXGn.DE DCX.N U.S. sales were up 3 percent on an unadjusted basis, including a 1 percent gain for Chrysler Group. Nissan Motor Co. Ltd.'s ( 7201.T ) sales rose 8.9 percent before adjusting for sales days. Honda Motor Co. Ltd. ( 7267.T ) posted a 2.4 percent gain on the same basis. January had 25 sales days, one more than the same month a year earlier. As a result, adjusted sales results were about 4 percentage points lower than the simple change in unit sales reported by the automakers. TOYOTA ALONE 'ON AN ISLAND' Toyota's sales rise marked its 20th consecutive monthly sales gain and reflected strong sales of its passenger cars, including the Camry sedan and luxury Lexus models, such as the ES350 and the LS 460. "Toyota is the outlier in an industry that is a bit weak," said GM sales analyst Paul Ballew. "They sit out there on an island right now." GM and Ford attributed their sales declines to earlier announced decisions to cut back on low-margin sales to car rental agencies and focus on more profitable sales to retail customers. But analysts said the underlying trend at showrooms also looked weak, raising the prospect of more aggressive incentive spending and lower margins for an industry struggling with chronic overcapacity. Edmunds.com analyst Jesse Toprak estimated overall incentive spending dropped 6 percent to some $2.6 billion in January, but said the pricing pressure could intensify in the months ahead. "If you're an automaker, you can't roll out new product in the short term so one of the only options you have is to step up incentives," he said. Chrysler's sales results were stronger than analysts had expected, but in contrast to Ford and GM it did not detail the share of its sales to fleet customers. The automaker, which is scheduled to announce a restructuring plan later this month, will cut first quarter production by a "significant" margin, spokesman Jason Vines said. Chrysler, which led the industry in estimated incentive spending in January, on Thursday rolled a new program of "value coupons" for dealers to offer buyers in addition to cash rebates on many of its models including the Dodge Charger and Magnum. GM also indicated that it would offer deeper discounts on some models this month and next. "We're going to maintain our competitiveness," Ballew said. "You'll see somewhat more aggressiveness...but we're not going to go down the path in which we just throw incentive dollar after incentive dollar." Ford, which is racing to cut jobs and shutter plants as its market share declines, said its retail sales had declined by about 5 percent in the month. Sales of its market-leading F-series pickup trucks were down 15 percent. "We are focused on getting this business back to profitability, full stop," Ford's chief sales analyst George Pipas said. "Where we are in sales races and rankings or where people forecast we are going to be is a distraction we are not going to be bothered with."
