 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. blue-chip stocks advanced on Thursday on optimism about strong profits from companies including Exxon Mobil Corp. ( XOM.N ) while the Nasdaq was flat. 


 Exxon Mobil shares added 1.2 percent to $74.99 and ranked among the biggest gainers in both the blue-chip Dow average and the S&P 500 after the oil company reported the highest full-year profit in U.S. corporate history. Boeing Co. ( BA.N ), the aircraft manufacturer and No. 2 U.S. defense contractor, led the Dow higher for the second day in a row. Analysts at Banc of America Securities and Citigroup increased their price targets on the stock a day after the company reporting stronger-than-expected earnings. Boeing shares rose 1.7 percent to $91.07 and hit a new lifetime high. The Nasdaq was little changed, with shares of Web search leader Google Inc. ( GOOG.O ) weighing on the index. Google dropped 2.4 percent to $489.50. Google reported a 67 percent jump in gross revenue, which beat a Wall Street consensus for growth of 64 percent, but analysts said the results still failed to live up to some investors' expectations. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  was up 24.27 points, or 0.19 percent, at 12,645.96. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  was up 4.97 points, or 0.35 percent, at 1,443.21. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  was down 0.16 points, or 0.01 percent, at 2,463.77.
