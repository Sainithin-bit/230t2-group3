 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A gauge of U.S. labor demand edged up 
in January, rebounding from December's sharp decline, as 
hirings picked up in some service sectors, Monster, the global 
online careers and recruiting firm, said on Thursday. 


  Monster said its Employment Index, which surveys online job 
sites, moved up to 168 points in January from 167 in December 
and 151 a year earlier.  "The labor market is expanding but at a moderated pace from 
what we saw in the early months of 2005 and 2006," said Steve 
Pogorzelski, group president of Monster Worldwide Inc. 
( MNST.O ), parent company of Monster.  A strong stock market and booming international trade 
boosted online recruiting of managers and positions in 
transportation and warehousing. Online hiring was also strong 
in the legal and food preparation fields, Monster said.  On the other hand, chilly weather and a cooling housing 
market continued to depress job demand in construction in 
January, according to Monster.  Overall, 12 of the 20 industries and five of the 23 
occupational categories tracked by the Monster index increased 
their online recruitment activity in January.  Online job demand in the nine U.S. regions tracked by 
Monster were flat to lower last month.  The Monster Employment index is a monthly analysis based on 
a review of more than 1,500 career sites, job boards and other 
Web sites. the margin of error is plus or minus 1 percent.
