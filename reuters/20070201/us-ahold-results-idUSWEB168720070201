 AMSTERDAM  (Reuters) - Dutch retailer Ahold ( AHLN.AS ) reported a 3 percent drop in fourth-quarter sales on Thursday, hurt by its sluggish U.S. retail operations and with margins hit by restructuring costs but investors shrugged off the bad news. 


 The world's fourth-biggest food retail and foodservice group by sales AHO.N said turnover was 10.4 billion euros ($13.46 billion), at the bottom end of a Reuters poll of 16 analysts with an average forecast of 10.5 billion euros. Ahold shares climbed 0.8 percent to 7.76 euros by 0830 GMT against a 0.6 percent rise in the DJ Stoxx retail index .SXRP. "The fact that Ahold is not doing great in the United States is not news. The stock has reached some kind of support level based on a sum-of-the-parts valuation range of 8.5 to 11 euros by analysts," said fund manager Lex Werkheim at asset management firm Eureffect, which holds Ahold shares. Fourth-quarter sales were up 3 percent at constant exchange rates. Ahold owns the Netherlands' biggest supermarket chain but generates more than 70 percent of its turnover in the United States. "Market conditions remained unchanged. Stop & Shop and Giant-Landover margins were impacted by price investments related to the further roll out of the value improvement program," Ahold said in a statement. In December, the retailer had warned of a challenging fourth quarter after rising competition and weaker economic conditions hurt its U.S. retail operations in the third quarter. Ahold is revamping its Stop & Shop, Giant-Landover and Giant-Carlisle supermarkets in the United States, hoping to lure shoppers with consistently lower prices, cheaper private-label products and more fresh produce. The strategy has worked well for Albert Heijn Arena in the Netherlands, which had sales of 1.8 billion euros in the fourth quarter, up 11 percent. Stop & Shop and Giant-Landover had 2.98 billion euros in turnover, down 7.9 percent, against a 10.5 percent drop for Giant-Carlisle/Tops to about 1 billion euros. HEDGE FUND PRESSURE Analysts had said continued weakness in U.S. retail operations could prompt hedge funds Centaurus Capital and Paulson & Co to renew their call for the sale of the activities. The hedge funds, which own a combined 6.4 percent of Ahold, said in August they wanted the retailer to sell all its U.S. assets and focus on Europe, arguing a sale would boost its shares to 9 euros. "The U.S. activities are a bit disappointing but the worse it gets there, the bigger the chances for more changes. Investors could appreciate this, as some have been pressing for change," Delta Lloyd trader Lex Bouwmeester said. Catering supplies unit U.S. Foodservice, which Ahold has put up for sale, had turnover of 3.4 billion euros, down 3.3 percent. Ahold did not make any comment about how the sale process was going. Ahold shares trade at about 15 times forecast 2006 earnings against 17 times for France's Carrefour ( CARR.PA ) and UK retailer Tesco's ( TSCO.L ) 19 times, according to Reuters data.
