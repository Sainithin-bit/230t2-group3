 SYDNEY  (Reuters) - Airline Partners Australia (APA), a consortium bidding for Australia's Qantas Airways ( QAN.AX ), said on Friday it would not increase its $8.7 billion buyout offer for the airline. 


 "The offer price of A$5.60 cannot, and will not, be increased in the absence of an alternative proposal being announced," APA said in its bidder's statement to Qantas shareholders. Qantas last month agreed to a takeover offer from APA, a consortium led by Macquarie Bank Ltd. MBL.AX and private equity firm Texas Pacific Group in the world's biggest airline takeover. APA said the bidders had agreed to provide senior debt facilities of at least US$7.87 billion and 375 million euros ($488.3 million).
