 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Pending sales of existing U.S. homes advanced a stronger-than-expected 4.9 percent in December, the biggest monthly gain since 2004, a real estate agents' trade association said on Thursday in a report showing some stability in the housing market. 


 The National Association of Realtors said its Pending Home Sales Index, based on contracts signed in December, rose to 112.4 from an upwardly revised level of 107.2 in November. The monthly gain was the biggest since a 6.9 percent advance in the index logged in March 2004. But, for all of 2006, pending sales were down 4.4 percent from 2005. Wall Street analysts polled ahead of the realtor report were expecting the index to come in at 107.0.
