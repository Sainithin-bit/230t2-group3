  WASHINGTON (Reuters)- U.S. incomes and spending rose as 
expected in December, while core consumer prices gained less 
than anticipated, a government report showed on Thursday. 


  But the U.S. savings rate for all of 2006, a negative 1 
percent, was the lowest since a negative 1.5 percent rate in 
1933, during the time of one of the worst economic depressions 
in U.S. history.  Incomes rose 0.5 percent in December after a 0.3 percent 
gain in November while spending climbed 0.7 percent after a 0.5 
percent rise in November, a Commerce Department report showed.  Core consumer prices, which exclude volatile energy and 
food costs, rose 0.1 percent in December after being unchanged 
in November. Analysts polled by Reuters were expecting a 0.2 
percent rise.  Core prices rose 2.2 percent from December a year ago, the 
same pace as the 12-month rise in November. Officials at the 
Federal Reserve have said they prefer the 12-month rise in core 
prices to remain between 1 percent and 2 percent.  The savings rate slipped to a negative 1.2 percent in 
December, the lowest since August. The savings rate has been 
negative since April 2005, 21 consecutive months.
