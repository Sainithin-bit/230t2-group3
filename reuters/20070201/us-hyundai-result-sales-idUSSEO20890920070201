 SEOUL  (Reuters) - Hyundai Motor Co. ( 005380.KS ), South Korea's top auto maker, said on Thursday its January sales fell 2.2 percent, hit by a bonuses dispute with its labor union. 


 Hyundai, the world's sixth-largest auto maker by sales volume along with its affiliate Kia Motors Corp. ( 000270.KS ), sold 201,865 vehicles in January, compared with 206,377 sold a year ago, Hyundai said in a filing with the Korea Exchange. The maker of the Santa Fe utility vehicle said it sold 156,552 units abroad last month, down 3.0 percent from 161,355 sold in January 2006. That compared to data from the commerce ministry showing South Korean auto makers' exports rose an estimated 12.5 percent in value from a year ago. But Hyundai's domestic sales gained 0.6 percent from a year ago to 45,313 units. "We expect a rebound in sales from this month since supplies (have) recovered to a normal phase with the strike over," Hyundai spokesman Jake Jang said by telephone. Hyundai said a partial strike and overtime boycott by its unionised workers from January 3 to January 17 in a bonus dispute cost the company 18,513 vehicles or 266.8 billion won ($284.6 million) in lost output. Among exports, sales from Hyundai's overseas plants, which were not interrupted by labor action, rose 15.6 percent to 74,914 vehicles in January from a year before, while exports from local plants fell 15.5 percent. Hyundai has factories in the United States, China, India and Turkey. Hyundai's January total sales fell 18.4 percent from revised sales of 247,252 units in December 2006, with January exports down 16.3 percent from 187,076 in the previous month. Domestic sales declined 24.7 percent in January from 60,176 in December. Shares in Hyundai rose 2.09 percent at 68,500 won, compared to the wider market's  .KS11  1.43 percent gain.
