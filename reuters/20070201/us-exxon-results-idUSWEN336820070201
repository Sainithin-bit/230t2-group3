 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp. ( XOM.N ) posted lower fourth-quarter earnings on Thursday on weaker natural gas prices and shrinking gasoline profits, but earnings for the full year 2006 were an eye-popping $39.5 billion, the highest in U.S. history. 


 The decline in quarterly profit was the first for Exxon Mobil since the January-March period of 2004. In the interim, it enjoyed huge profits thanks to a wild bull market in crude oil; oil prices more than doubled and the company reaped profits of over $85 billion. Its full year revenue was about $377.64 billion, larger than the economy of Switzerland, the seventeenth largest economy in the world in 2005. Exxon Mobil also held the old U.S. record for annual corporate earnings -- $36.13 billion in 2005. Exxon Mobil and other U.S. oil companies have been at the center of a firestorm in Washington due to their massive profits over the past two years. After taking over Congress this year, Democrats have quickly moved to roll back industry tax breaks and aim to force the companies to pay more drilling royalties. "Exxon Mobil's outlandish profits are the direct result of a Bush energy policy that for seven years has used every lever of the American government to tilt the scales toward satisfying the special interest demands of a single industry," said U.S. Representative Edward Markey, a Democrat from Massachusetts. But the company said its earnings were not out of line given the billions of dollars it invests around the globe. "Our revenues are large and they need to be to support the huge investments we make to produce the energy our country and the world needs. Our profit margin for 2006 was about 10 percent. We keep a dime on every dollar of revenue," said Ken Cohen, the company's vice president of public affairs. INCOME DROP Net income in the fourth quarter dropped to $10.25 billion from $10.71 billion a year earlier. Per-share earnings rose to $1.76 from $1.71 because of a decrease in shares outstanding. The company has been using extra cash to buy back shares. Excluding one-time items, Exxon Mobil, the world's largest publicly traded company, earned $1.69 a share. The average earnings forecast of analysts polled by Reuters Estimates was $1.51 a share. The decline in Exxon's earnings mirror similar fourth-quarter drops at U.S. rivals ConocoPhillips ( COP.N ), Marathon Oil Corp. ( MRO.N ) and Hess Corp. ( HES.N ), a trend analysts say could mean the companies have passed a peak in the earnings cycle, at least in the near-term. Royal Dutch Shell ( RDSa.L ), the second-largest Western oil company, posted an 11 percent increase in quarterly earnings on Thursday on higher production, strong oil prices, and profit from asset sales. Exxon and other U.S. oil companies have been at the center of a firestorm in Washington due to their massive profits over the past two years. After taking over Congress this year, Democrats have quickly moved to roll back industry tax breaks and aim to force the companies to pay more drilling royalties. REVENUE ALSO DOWN Oil and gas production decreased by 1 percent in the quarter compared with a year earlier. Excluding the impact of sales of producing properties and other special factors, production increased 2 percent. "The oil and gas production numbers are not good," said Benchmark Co. analyst Mark Gilman. "This is very much looking like a quarter that is not going to change our assessment of the company going forward too much. I'm not bullish on the sector, and Exxon is one of the priciest names on a valuation basis in the sector." Revenue in the fourth quarter fell 9.4 percent from a year earlier to $90.03 billion. Earnings from exploration and production activities were $6.22 billion, down $818 million due to the natural gas price drop and decreased volumes as a result of lower demand in Europe. The company said it produced about 4.2 million barrels of oil equivalent per day in the quarter, down from about 4.3 million barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2005. It said its average price for crude oil in the U.S. was $51.26 a barrel, down from $52.23 a barrel in the fourth quarter of 2005. Its average non-U.S. crude oil price rose to $56.36 a barrel from $53.02 a barrel a year earlier. Exxon's average price for natural gas it sold in the U.S was $6.22 per thousand cubic feet in the quarter, down from $11.34 per thousand cubic feet in 2005. Its average price for European natural gas was $8.57 per thousand cubic feet in the fourth quarter of 2006, up from $7.11 a year earlier. Earnings from refining and marketing operations totaled $1.86 billion, down $430 million due to lower margins. On a conference call with investors, Exxon Mobil said its refinery maintenance schedule was a little bit heavier than usual in 2006 and expects to do a similar amount of work in 2007. The company's fourth quarter profit at its chemicals business rose to $1.24 billion, an increase of $407 million on better margins and volumes. Exxon Mobil shares closed at $75.08, up 98 cents or 1.3 percent, on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday. Since the end of the 2006 third quarter, the shares are up more than 12 percent, outperforming the Chicago Board Options Exchange's oil index .OIX, which has risen 8.8 percent.
