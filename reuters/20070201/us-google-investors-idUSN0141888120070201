 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Google Inc.'s ( GOOG.O ) strong revenue growth prompted analysts to raise targets for the share on Thursday, but a drop in the stock showed that some investors question its potential for further rises in the near term. 


 Shares in Google fell 3 percent even though the company, in its quarterly earnings report late on Wednesday, posted a 67 percent jump in gross revenue -- or more than 70 percent excluding the financial cut for Web affiliates that show Google advertising. While that beat a Wall Street consensus of 64 percent growth, investors had built up expectations of a steeper rise in recent weeks, sending the stock down to about $487. "This is plain and simple a sentiment issue," said Michael Church, analyst at Church Capital Management. "Analysts are obviously very pleased with the quarter ... investors were expecting a whole fireworks show." "People are now looking at this $500 stock and saying what's the upside here? If it goes to $600 is that really the pop that traders are looking for?" he said. At least eight analysts raised their price targets for Google shares on Thursday, including analysts at Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch, UBS, RBC Capital Markets and Prudential. Some of the price increases brought their view of Google shares closer to, or above, a $600 milestone mark. The higher expectations stemmed from recent data showing that Google had captured an even greater share of Internet search queries, boosting hopes it was also improving upon its ability to turn those queries into advertising dollars. "Expectations for revenue got ahead of themselves ... and the company is also investing in the business as it should," said Stifel Nicolaus analyst Scott Devitt. "For a short-term trader that could be viewed negatively. From a long-term investor standpoint, it's all good." Google is trading at a multiple of 26 times estimated 2008 earnings, according to Devitt. That estimate is in line with the average of analysts' views compiled by Reuters Estimates. Rival Yahoo trades at a multiple of about 40. Devitt also raised his price target on the share to $585 from $554. Google shares fell $15.50 to $486 on the Nasdaq after trading as low as $485 earlier in the session. The stock is up 13 percent from a year ago, nearly in line with a 12.6 percent rise in the Standard & Poor's 500 Index in that time. LONG TERM VERSUS SHORT TERM UBS analyst Benjamin Schachter wrote in a research note that his view of the share was "incrementally more positive" in light of the results. "Google continues to invest for the long term, and while that may temper results in the near term, we believe it is the right thing to do for the business," he said. Schachter rates the share a "buy" and raised his price target on the stock to $560 from $535. Shares of Google staged a spectacular rise from its August 2004 IPO, but fell hard a year ago, losing nearly 30 percent of their value during the first half of 2006 on concerns it faced mounting competition in its core Web search market. The company has posted steady market share gains for most of the past year in Web search and is expanding into a variety of new markets. For 2007, the consensus revenue forecast calls for about 49 percent growth, according to Reuters Estimates. Google is growing two-to-three times faster than competitors eBay Inc. ( EBAY.O ), IAC/InterActivecorp ( IACI.O ), Microsoft Corp. ( MSFT.O ) and Yahoo Inc. ( YHOO.O ) Google executives said future growth would be bolstered by a high rate of capital investment and new formats beyond its textual ads that appear in Internet searches. Analysts said they expected those efforts would pay off. "I am very reluctant to consider 70 percent growth mature," said Devitt. "Particularly when you have opportunities such as radio, mobile (search), TV and payment processing."
