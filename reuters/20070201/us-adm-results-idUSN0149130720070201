 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Archer Daniels Midland Co. ( ADM.N ) on Thursday posted record quarterly profit on higher selling prices for ethanol and corn sweetener, beating Wall Street expectations and sending its stock up more than 9 percent. 


 But ADM, the largest U.S. food processor and ethanol producer, expects ethanol prices to be flat through March, which analysts said could squeeze margins given recent rises in the price of corn, which ADM processes into the fuel additive. Corn futures at the Chicago Board of Trade <0#C:> hit a 10-year high in November at about $3.45 a bushel and rose above $4 in January. "They had a great quarter, but I think there's a lot of speculation about whether that's sustainable," said Morningstar analyst Ann Gilpin. ADM earnings rose 20 percent to $441 million, or 67 cents per share, in the fiscal second quarter, ended December 31, compared with $368 million, or 56 cents per share, a year earlier. Analysts, on average, were expecting 60 cents per share before one-time items, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue rose 18 percent to $10.98 billion -- the first time sales exceeded $10 billion. The average forecast from analysts polled by Reuters was $9.61 billion. But the forecast for flat ethanol prices was "a red flag," Gilpin said. "Corn prices are really high and oil prices are coming down, which means ethanol production may be less profitable," Gilpin said. Corn futures have remained about $4, helped by President Bush setting a goal of a five-fold increase in alternative fuels usage during the next 10 years -- most of which is expected to come from corn-based ethanol. ADM does not disclose its profit margins on ethanol or even break out ethanol as one of its business segments. It is part of its bioproducts division, which also includes animal feed and food additives. Profit from bioproducts rose 55 percent to $189.3 million, up from $122.5 million a year ago. Corn processing profit, which includes bioproducts, rose 42 percent to $335.5 million. Increased ethanol and sweetener selling prices partially offset higher corn costs. ADM said corn sweetener selling prices should rise 20 percent in 2007. ADM's ethanol capacity is at 1 billion gallons, with plans in place to add another 550 million gallons. Total U.S. ethanol production was 5 billion gallons last year. "We remain very confident about our strategic direction," said ADM Chief Executive Patricia Woertz. "We're always talking about the long term and not trying to give guidance in the short term, but I think we have confidence in the ability to manage through this." In ADM's other divisions, oilseed processing profits rose 50 percent to $192 million due to improved margins in all regions, the company said. ADM had previously announced it was expanding seven oilseed processing plants in the United States and Canada to support its biodiesel facilities. Agricultural services profit rose to $122.8 million, up from $93.6 million the year before. Other segment profit rose to $116.7 million, up from $65.7 million a year earlier, the company said. ADM shares were up 9.4 percent at $35 on the New York Stock Exchange, but are still far from the stock's all-time high of $46.70 in May. ADM shares have underperformed the food processing sector this year, rising 9.5 percent through Wednesday compared with a 15.9 percent gain in the Dow Jones U.S. Food Producers Index. .DJUSFO.
