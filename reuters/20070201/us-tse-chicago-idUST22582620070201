 TOKYO  (Reuters) - The Tokyo Stock Exchange TSE.UL and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) CME.N will begin talks on a possible business tie-up, the Nikkei business daily reported in its evening edition on Thursday. 


 The paper said the Chicago exchange, the U.S.'s biggest futures trading market, proposed the alliance plan, which would include the mutual listing of futures, options and other financial derivatives. TSE spokesman Toru Onoda said president Taizo Nishimuro is visiting the city of Chicago on Thursday but he did not know his detailed schedule. Onoda said the TSE and the CME agreed in 2000 to discuss an alliance, although they had not set up concrete plans. The world's stock exchanges have been increasingly joining hands in alliances and mergers to share the heavy burden of investing in next-generation systems, as well as keep up with competition and the globalization of information and trading. The TSE, Asia's biggest bourse, and NYSE Group Inc. NYX.N said on Wednesday they would form a strategic alliance. The two exchanges will develop and study opportunities in trading systems and technology, investment products and governance. The TSE is also in talks with the London Stock Exchange ( LSE.L ) about an alliance.
