 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. manufacturing unexpectedly contracted in January to its slowest pace since April 2003 as new orders, inventories and production fell, according to a survey published on Thursday. 


 The Institute for Supply Management said its index of national factory activity eased to 49.3 from 51.4 in December, below economists' median forecast for a slight rise to 51.9. A reading below 50 indicates shrinkage in the sector. U.S. Treasuries US10YT=RR briefly extended gains while the dollar .DXY weakened immediately after the ISM survey. "The ISM manufacturing index was weaker than expected and dovetails with our assessment that the manufacturing sector is really very weak and on the brink of recession," said Richard Iley, economist at BNP Paribas in New York. "There are considerable downside risks to growth underlined by this survey ... consistent with an economy growing below trend and which may still require a (monetary) policy ease," he added. New orders, a gauge of future growth, fell to 50.3 from 51.9 the previous month, while the employment index edged up to 49.5 from 49.4. The production component of the overall index fell to 49.6 from 52.4 in December. The ISM's inventory index fell to its lowest since February 2002 at 39.9 from December's 48.5, analysts from Societe Generale and HFE Economics said.
