 LONDON  (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell Plc ( RDSa.L ) said on Thursday its growth plans were based mainly on organic growth rather than acquisitions, despite increasing speculation about industry consolidation. 


 Chief Executive Jeroen van der Veer said acquisitions could only be justified if one could extract big synergies. "One can only expect a lot of synergies ... if there's a very good fit and then its unlikely to be very big," he told reporters on a conference call. "Our path forward is mainly organic growth," van der Veer added. Separately, Shell's head of refining, Rob Routs gave a pessimistic outlook for his subsector. "The refining business and the chemical business have been extremely cyclical over the years and we better enjoy the good times now," Routs said. "We know that with a number of refining expansions out there, especially east of Suez, refining margins will go south again in time".
