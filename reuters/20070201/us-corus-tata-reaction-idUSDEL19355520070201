 NEW DELHI (Reuters). "India's High Noon" ... "Empire Strikes Back" ... "India Inc set a new global standard". 


 Tata Steel's ( TISC.BO ) winning $12.2 billion bid for an Anglo Dutch company, India's biggest-ever foreign takeover, sparked a media frenzy on Thursday and celebrations from businessmen saying the victory heralded India's strengthening global economic punch. Newspapers splashed the news across front pages in coverage that dwarfed the last national media obsession -- when Bollywood star Shilpa Shetty won British TV's Big Brother reality show amid allegations she had been racially taunted by contestants. "It reaffirms the arrival of India as a big player in the globalization game, one that looks upon companies and markets of the world as its playground," wrote the Times of India, one of the country's most respected newspapers, in an editorial. Tata Steel's bid for Corus CS.L CS.AS beat another offer from Brazil's CSN ( SID.N ), formerly known as Companhia Siderurgica Nacional ( CSNA3.SA ), after what for many had been a nail-biting nine-round auction. It had all the ingredients of a good yarn. A nascent economic power; a company led by the elderly patriarch of one of India's best known business families; and memories of an Indian firm that battled British colonialism to emerge as a giant. Many observers contrasted the new confidence on the global stage of Indian companies like Tata with calls only 15 years ago from many firms -- fearing competition as reforms tentatively opened the economy -- for protection against globalization. STEEPED IN HISTORY For many Indians, Tata is also not just any old company. Founded by Jamsetji Tata in the mid-19th century, it had to fight public put-downs by British officials and initial attempts by colonial authorities to shackle its expansion -- a fact not forgotten by one newspaper that splashed "Empire Strikes Back" on its front page. "This is truly a shot in the arm for Indian companies with global ambitions ... (India) now stands on the verge of becoming a great economic and industrial power," Lakshmi Mittal, chairman of the world's largest steelmaker Arcelor Mittal and India's most celebrated businessman, wrote in the Economic Times. Mittal's takeover of European steel firm Arcelor last year was celebrated by Indian businessmen after they labeled stiff opposition from several European governments as xenophobic. Tata's winning bid on Wednesday was hailed as another shot across the bows of European and U.S. companies that face increased competition from Asian giants. "With this deal we are witnessing the emergence of India's first global brand. I tell my non-Indian friends to remember the name Tata: soon it will be as ubiquitous as Citibank or General Electric," wrote former U.S. diplomat William Avery in the Times of India. Despite the upbeat mood, there was room in the column inches for skepticism about the price Tata paid for the company. Tata Steel shares dropped about 11 percent on Wednesday on news of the high offer and fell further on Thursday. Out on the street, where most of the one billion population struggle to make ends meet, many people were indifferent to the high drama of corporate dealings. "It might be interesting news for those people dealing in steel, but for the layman in the street it doesn't really matter to them," Mohit Guglani, 26, an insurance worker, said as he walked in a business district with two similarly uninterested colleagues.
