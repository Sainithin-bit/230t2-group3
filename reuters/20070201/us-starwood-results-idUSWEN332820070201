 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide Inc. ( HOT.N ), whose chains include St. Regis, Westin and Sheraton, posted a greater-than-expected fourth-quarter profit on Thursday, helped by higher room rates. 


 Starwood also forecast profit for the first quarter and full year 2007 above Wall Street's expectations, saying it continued to expect increases in room revenue. The results, coming a day after an upbeat outlook by Hilton Hotels Corp. HLT.N, signal that the hotel industry expects good times to continue despite fears about the effects of a slowing U.S. economy on travel. "It's consistent with continued strength in lodging industry fundamentals," Susquehanna Financial Group analyst Robert LaFleur said. "There has been some concern about that lately." Starwood said net income in the fourth quarter increased 27.6 percent to $203 million, or 93 cents per share, from $159 million, or 70 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, the company said it earned 92 cents a share. Excluding a restructuring charge, loss on gain of asset dispositions, gains on sale of notes receivables and tax credits, the company earned 81 cents per share, compared with analysts' expectation of 73 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. The White Plains, New York-based company, along with most of the U.S. lodging industry, has been enjoying strong travel demand and limited growth in supply, allowing for steady increases in room rates. Starwood's fourth-quarter revenue rose 3.7 percent to $1.57 billion. Management and franchise revenues increased 54.8 percent over last year. Revenue per available room, a key industry measure of the chain's health, increased 9.1 percent from a year earlier at comparable hotels in North America and 11.4 percent worldwide. Margins at comparable owned hotels worldwide and in North America improved 280 and 153 basis points, respectively. Starwood said it expected revenue per available room at comparable owned hotels in North America to rise between 7 percent and 9 percent in 2007. It forecast full-year earnings per share of about $2.50 before special items, compared with analysts' expectation of $2.47. For the first quarter, the company forecast a profit of 38 cents per share and revpar at comparable owned hotels in North America to increase 8 percent to 10 percent. Analysts expect the company to post a profit of 34 cents per share in the first quarter.
