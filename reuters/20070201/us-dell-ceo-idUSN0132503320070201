 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Michael Dell's return as chief executive of the computer maker he founded 23 years ago is unlikely to fix a company quickly that stumbled under ex-CEO Kevin Rollins, analysts said on Thursday. 


 Dell, 41, retook the reins of Dell Inc. DELL.O, the world's No. 2 personal computer maker, on Wednesday after 18 months of missteps by Rollins, 54, who had been under pressure by investors to resign. The company said fourth-quarter revenue and earnings were probably below analysts' estimates. Michael Dell gave no specific plans to turn around the company. In a statement announcing his return as CEO, he said he was "enthusiastic about Dell 2.0," a series of initiatives to improve customer service and enhance Dell's products. "It remains to be seen whether he's going to change things," said Shaw Wu, an analyst at American Technology Research who has a "neutral' rating on Dell shares. "The advantages that Dell had when he ran the company have been greatly narrowed in the last two years." Shares of Dell on Thursday retraced earlier gains as investors and analysts questioned whether Michael Dell's return as CEO would rekindle growth that slowed from 21 percent in 2004 to 3.4 percent in the three months ended in November. Dell on Wednesday said it expected fourth-quarter results below analysts' average estimates, which called for earnings per share of 32 cents on revenue of $15.3 billion. Dell last year lost the No. 1 PC market share post to Hewlett-Packard Co. ( HPQ.N ) in a difficult year for the company. The company in August recalled laptop batteries made by Sony Corp. ( 6758.T ) in the biggest-ever U.S. consumer electronics recall. It has also had complaints of poor after-sales service, a problem it is trying to address by spending more than $150 million to hire more customer service representatives and better train them. The stock earlier on Thursday rose as much as 5.1 percent to $25.50 on Nasdaq and was trading up 34 cents, or 1.4 percent, at $24.59 in midday trading. The shares rose almost 5 percent in after-hours trading on Thursday following Dell's ouster of Rollins. CHANGE, CHANGE, CHANGE Still, some analysts cheered the news that Dell, a charismatic entrepreneur who in 1992 became the youngest CEO ever of a Fortune 500 company, was returning to the top post at the company. Dell will continue to be chairman, a title he has held since founding the company in his University of Texas dormroom in 1984. "The return of Michael Dell gives us greater confidence that more significant changes will occur," said a research note from J.P. Morgan, which upgraded its opinion on Dell shares to "neutral" from "underweight." Merrill Lynch analyst Richard Farmer lifted his rating of the stock to "buy" from "neutral," saying the move indicates "a new level of board commitment to serious change at the company." "We expect more aggressive efforts to lower the cost structure ahead," Farmer said in an investor note. "Dell's high exposure to the corporate PC market should swing from a fundamental negative to a positive as the corporate PC market slowly shifts out of a multiyear slump into a Vista-led upgrade cycle." The founder, whose 10 percent stake in Dell is worth about $5.5 billion, pioneered a "build-to-order" model in the personal computer industry that eventually made Dell the leading computer maker.
