 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - CVS Corp. ( CVS.N ), the No. 2 U.S. drugstore chain, posted a 2.7 percent rise in quarterly profit on Thursday, driven by strong sales of prescription medications and greater use of generic drugs, which are more profitable for pharmacies. 


 Shares of CVS, which hopes to buy pharmacy benefits manager Caremark Rx Inc. CMX.N, rose 1 percent in early electronic trading. Fourth-quarter profit rose to $417.2 million, or 49 cents per share, from $406.4 million, or 48 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding a benefit from an accounting adjustment, CVS earned 46 cents per share, topping analysts' average forecast of 44 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. CVS said the impact of the June acquisition of 701 Sav-on and Osco stores trimmed earnings about 5 cents per share. The company also said that sales at stores open at least a year rose 8.6 percent in January. Total January sales soared 24.2 percent to $3.7 billion, benefiting from the addition of the Sav-on and Osco stores. Pharmacy same-store sales rose 8.7 percent in January, while sales of "front-end," or general merchandise, rose 8.2 percent. CVS, based in Woonsocket, Rhode Island, previously reported that quarterly sales jumped 24 percent to $12.1 billion, with sales at stores open more than one year up 8.7 percent. Sales rose despite worries late last year that Wal-Mart Stores Inc.'s ( WMT.N ) $4 generic drug plan would pressure the drugstore industry. While generic medicines are cheaper, they are more profitable for pharmacies since the prices of branded drugs are tightly controlled by the major drug companies that manufacture and sell them. Caremark accepted CVS's all-stock bid in November. A Caremark rival, Express Scripts Inc. ( ESRX.O ), entered the fray in December with an unsolicited cash-and-stock offer, but Caremark still favors the CVS takeover. In January, CVS sweetened its offer with plans to pay a special $2-per-share dividend to Caremark shareholders once the deal closes. Shares of CVS rose to $34 in early electronic trading, up from Wednesday's closing price of $33.65.
