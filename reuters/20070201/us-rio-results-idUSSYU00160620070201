 SYDNEY  (Reuters) - Rio Tinto ( RIO.AX ) posted a 25 percent rise in second-half net profit, driven by high prices for commodities such as aluminum, copper and iron ore, and said it had little or no spare capacity amid strong demand. 


 Rio ( RIO.L ), which mines and refines materials used in everything from bathroom taps to skyscrapers, has benefited from booming commodity prices in recent years fueled by supply shortages tied in large part to China's rapid economic growth. The mining giant's underlying net profit for the six months to end-December rose to $3.59 billion, it said on Thursday, at the low end of market forecasts. Full-year profit rose 48 percent to $7.34 billion. Rio, listed in London and Australia, is paying a final dividend of 64 cents. That will make the total dividend 30 percent higher at 104 cents, above analysts' expectations and seen as a sign of confidence by Rio. Cazenove analysts said the dividend payout was "a positive message regarding Rio's confidence in the cycle". Looking ahead to 2007, Chairman Paul Skinner told reporters: "We think we are looking at some moderation in global growth. But it is still expected to remain strong at more than 4 percent which will support solid demand for most metals and minerals." Rio shares, which closed 2.2 percent higher at A$78.29 in Sydney before its results were published, were 0.8 percent lower at 2,694 pence in London at 1015 GMT. While the company saw the overall outlook for commodities as positive in 2007 with prices remaining well above long-run averages, analysts said the outlook was more mixed. "We see aluminum as one of the better performers in base metals this year, which should help Rio," said Australia & New Zealand Bank analyst Andrew Harrington. "But we are much less positive on copper, which is more important to the company." Copper prices MCU3 zoomed to a record $8,800 a ton in London Metal Exchange trading in May, but have mostly been in decline since, ending 2006 at $6,630. The price has since dropped by about a further $1,000. Copper was the company's top profit source in 2006, generating earnings of $3.56 billion, with iron ore second at $2.28 billion. NO NEW BUYBACK Last year's plan to return $4 billion to shareholders was completed a year ahead of schedule, and Rio did not announce any new shareholder reward initiatives, suggesting rising project costs were biting into stronger cash flows from high commodity prices. "Shareholders have been getting used to buybacks. But how long this can go on is a question companies such as Rio are asking themselves," Fat Prophets analyst Gavin Wendt said. UBS analysts, who have a "Buy" rating on Rio shares and a 4,000 pence price target, said: "The 30 percent increase in the ordinary dividend should be seen as a rebasing and is a positive step. We believe Rio can afford to increase again in 2008." In a conference call, Rio executives said it has little or no spare capacity as it tries to meet demand, and all its projects were on schedule and budget. "Supply is generally still constrained and our operations are running pretty much flat out to meet demand, with little or no spare capacity available," Skinner said. Rio said while it saw record production runs in a number of its mineral commodities, shortages in key mining supplies and in skilled staff were causing cost pressures and delays. Higher costs cut annual earnings by $741 million, it said. "We remain focused on meeting these challenges through improved productivity and the spread of best practice across the group," Chief Executive Leigh Clifford said, adding he was being careful not to lock in today's cost levels for the future. Price changes in major commodities in 2006 boosted full-year earnings by $3.1 billion, Rio said. But production hiccups at two key subsidiaries -- Coal and Allied Industries Ltd. CNA.AX and Energy Australia Ltd. ( ERA.AX ) -- weighed on 2006 profits. Significantly lower output from its part-owned Grasberg mine in Indonesia due to mining of lower grade ore cut earnings by $355 million, the company said. The company's diamond mining business also was strained, with lower sales from the Argyle mine in Australia -- the world's biggest -- due to a build-up of diamond inventories as markets softened. Rio's stock fell 4.5 percent in the second half of 2006, in step with mixed pricing for minerals commodities, compared with an 11.7 percent rise in the Australian S&P/ASX 200 Index.
