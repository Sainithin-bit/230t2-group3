 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Anheuser-Busch Cos. Inc. ( BUD.N ) posted a higher quarterly profit on Thursday, driven by stronger U.S. shipments of beer, higher prices and demand for its imports. 


 Fourth-quarter net income for the largest U.S. brewer was $190.7 million, or 25 cents per share, compared with $145.6 million, or 19 cents per share, a year ago. Analysts, on average, were expecting 26 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Shares of Anheuser-Busch rose 13 cents or 0.26 percent to $51.10 per share on the New York Stock Exchange. Anheuser-Busch, maker of Budweiser and Bud Light, said net sales for the quarter were $3.42 billion, up from $3.37 billion million a year ago. Analysts on average expected quarterly sales of $3.39 billion. Domestic beer segment sales fell 1 percent due to 3.6 percent lower beer sales volume, while reported beer volume rose 0.8 percent and revenue per barrel rose 2 percent, as Anheuser raised prices in some markets during the summer. Last year, the company took price cuts amid sluggish growth in the U.S. beer market, forcing competitors like Miller Brewing Co., a unit of SABMiller Plc ( SAB.L ), to follow suit. Anheuser-Busch, whose Bud Light is the top-selling brand in the United States, controls about half the U.S. beer market. But Bud Light's dominance is being challenged by imported light beers, such as Heineken Premium Light and Corona Light. The St. Louis-based company did not provide quarterly outlook in a press release but said its long-term target is to increase profit by 7 to 10 percent per year.
