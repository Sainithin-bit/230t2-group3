 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Vornado Realty Trust ( VNO.N ) said on Thursday it raised its takeover offer for Equity Office Properties Trust EOP.N to $56 per share, above a rival bid of $54 per share from private equity firm Blackstone Group that Equity Office has already accepted. 


 Vornado's new $23.24 billion cash-and-stock offer was below some analysts' expectations and Blackstone responded quickly by saying it has no intention of increasing its all-cash $22.4 billion offer. Equity Office, the largest U.S. office landlord, said it would evaluate the new Vornado proposal "in due course" and that its trustees continue to recommend the Blackstone deal, on which Equity Office shareholders will vote in just four days time. Vornado's proposal could take several months to close. Analysts appeared divided on which offer is more attractive, but Equity Office's biggest institutional shareholder, asset manager Cohen & Steers, said it still favored the Vornado offer. "I am puzzled at the assertion that Blackstone's $54 offer is better than Vornado's $56," said Martin Cohen, co-chief executive of Cohen & Steers, which controls 8 percent of Equity Office stock. "I think Vornado's offer assures shareholders that they will get no less than $56, and also have a call on the upside of Vornado's stock. Why would I accept $54?" The competing offers represent the largest-ever battle for a real estate investment trust (REIT) and one that involves big personalities in the real estate and private equity industries. Equity Office was founded more than 30 years ago by real estate magnate Sam Zell. Vornado's new offer puts its chief executive, Steven Roth, up against Blackstone CEO Stephen Schwarzman, whose private equity firm has played a central role in a wave of real estate deals. DEBT In a statement, Blackstone stood firm behind its offer. "We do not believe that the true value of Vornado's proposal is anywhere near $56 per share and Blackstone has no intention of increasing its all cash price," said Blackstone spokesman John Ford. "The true value of Vornado's offer should reflect a discount for stock, the 3-4 month time delay before receiving it and the risk of Vornado's share price declining below $115 per share." Vornado's offer ensures the overall value of its bid remains $56 per share as long as the Vornado share price remains between $115 and $135. A special meeting of Equity Office shareholders to vote on the Blackstone deal remains scheduled for February 5 and completion of the deal is expected on or about February 8, subject to shareholder approval. "People think the board is going to elect to go with the $54 bid," said Michael Knott, office REIT analyst at Green Street Advisors. "There's risk of a longer time frame (with Vornado). There's a lot that could go wrong in that time frame." But Jay Rosenberg, co-manager of the First American Real Estate Securities Fund, pointed out some Equity Office shareholders may not be opposed to receiving some Vornado stock rather than all cash. "There are probably some dedicated real estate investors that have large holdings in Equity Office that are a little bit nervous to reinvest all that cash and the Vornado deal does offer some positives in terms of not having to invest the (cash) because you're getting a bunch of Vornado stock," said Rosenberg. Vornado shares were up $2.89 at $125.24 and Equity Office stock fell 50 cents to $55.05. Including debt, Blackstone's offer is valued at $38.3 billion, which would make it one of the biggest leveraged buyouts ever. Vornado's new offer has a total value of $41 billion, including debt and "all potential transaction costs." Vornado said it obtained up to $30.5 billion of debt finance commitment from Lehman Brothers, JP Morgan, Barclays Capital, RBS Greenwich Capital and UBS. PRICE A Vornado spokeswoman confirmed Starwood Capital Group Global LLC and Walton Street Capital LLC were no longer part of Vornado's bid. But Vornado said it was in discussions to sell up to $10 billion of Equity Office assets to Starwood Capital and Walton Street Capital. Blackstone would receive a $500 million breakup fee if Equity Office terminated their agreement. Under Vornado's new offer, each Equity Office share would convert into $31 in cash and Vornado common shares having a value equal to $25. Vornado said its offer allowed Equity Office to continue to pay its regular quarterly dividends at the rate of 33 cents per share and includes pro rata dividends to the closing. Vornado expects the acquisition to boost its funds from operations per share beginning in 2008. "The fact that this is not going to be accretive until 2008 just demonstrates that moving higher at this point is just making it tighter," said Shawn Campbell, principal with Campbell Asset Management. "It's getting much more difficult to justify this deal." (Additional reporting by  Ben Klayman ,  Ilaina Jonas  and  Jessica Hall )
