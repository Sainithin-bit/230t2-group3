 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - The second-largest union for U.S. hourly workers at Delphi Corp. DPHIQ.PK expects to start intensive contract talks on February 12 with the bankrupt auto parts maker aimed at trying to reach deals within weeks, it said on Thursday. 


 The meetings between the union, Delphi, a group planning to invest up to $3.4 billion in the company, and former Delphi parent General Motors Corp. ( GM.N ) will aim for tentative agreements by the end of February, the International Union of Electrical Workers-Communications Workers of America said. Delphi must reach agreements with its unions and GM to complete a $3.4 billion investment deal with a group led by Cerberus Capital Management LP and Appaloosa Management LP to support its emergence from bankruptcy.
