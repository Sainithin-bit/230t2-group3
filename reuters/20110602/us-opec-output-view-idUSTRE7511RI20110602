 LONDON  (Reuters) - OPEC is considering raising its target for crude oil supply by as much as 1.5 million barrels per day (bpd), a delegate to next week's meeting of the group told Reuters on Thursday. 

 The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, which pumps more than a third of the world's oil, is due to meet in Vienna on June 8 to discuss output and its response to a sharp rise in oil prices that could be a drag on economic growth. The 11 members of OPEC bound by the group's targets pumped 26.23 million bpd in May, nearly 1.4 million bpd above their target of 24.84 million bpd, a Reuters survey showed. <OPEC/O> Here are some analysts' and fund managers' responses: DAVID WECH, ANALYST, JBC ENERGY IN VIENNA: "If this is 1 million barrels per day (bpd) on top of the targets from over two years ago, then it's meaningless. If it's 1 million bpd above their current production levels, then it's exactly what the market needs. But it will depend on whether they can implement it." "If they don't fulfill what they say, then the market will start to question OPEC spare capacity and that would be bullish." "The other issue is it's very difficult at the moment to push barrels on to the market because margins are weak. They would have to sell below current market levels, so it will depend on whether they are willing to do that." LEO DROLLAS, CHIEF ECONOMIST, CENTRE FOR GLOBAL ENERGY STUDIES: "Targets are out of date and have no relevance, so if they have to change these, it's a huge exercise, especially given problems with Libya. "Instead of a formal increase, they could adjust from the current production levels, but it's still very difficult because they don't all have spare production. OPEC is really at the end of the day ineffective as, apart from Saudi Arabia and the UAE, they haven't invested enough. Saudi Arabia can almost run it single-handedly now. There's a mini cartel within the main one." OLIVIER JAKOB, CONSULTANT, PETROMATRIX, ZUG, SWITZERLAND: "We continue to believe that it will be difficult for OPEC to make any formal adjustments to the individual quotas given the legal implications of having Libya being part of any new agreement. Any additional supply will anyway mostly come out of Saudi Arabia, and what is relevant is not what OPEC does but what Saudi Arabia does." "A few OPEC watchers are indicating an increase of Saudi production/supplies in June, and if formally confirmed by Saudi Arabia, that should be enough to counter any negative sentiment coming out of a lack of decisive formal plan from OPEC." ROY JORDAN, RESEARCH ASSOCIATE, FACTS GLOBAL ENERGY: "I believe that a higher ceiling would only be a gesture toward the call from politicians in major importing countries for more oil and would not have much impact on the level of crude prices nor on the economy. It would not be a historic move because members have been supplying refiners with the volume they required for some time now. The loss of Libyan exports makes it marginally tighter, but there is plenty of spare upstream production and downstream refining capacity." "I still feel the most likely outcome is that OPEC will not formally raise the ceiling but will say that oil will be available to cover refiners' requirements and that members will continue to monitor market conditions very carefully. If they want to make an impact on crude prices, they can always reduce their own official selling prices, just as consumer governments could reduce domestic prices by lowering tax levels." CHRISTOPHE BARRET, GLOBAL OIL ANALYST, CREDIT AGRICOLE: "Current OPEC production ... is close to 1.2-1.5 million above quota. An increase of around 1-1.5 million would just put the quota in line with actual production." "In terms of physical supply, it will have little impact as they already produce much more than quota. I'm sure they will increase production in the coming months, because you will have additional demand from refineries coming back from maintenance. But this move will send a signal to the market that OPEC is ready to supply more crude." "There is a lot of pressure on OPEC from the EIA to increase the quota, and this is a good opportunity for OPEC now to say it looks like Libya will remain out of the market longer than expected. So as we are losing Libyan production, we should offset it by increasing the quota of other members." WILL RILEY, CO-MANAGER, GUINNESS GLOBAL ENERGY FUND: "It's not a huge surprise because they do need to raise production. We do expect OPEC to increase production to compensate for the Libyan outage over the rest of this year. "An increase of 1.5 million bpd is unlikely. OPEC are sensibly trying to keep the oil price within a band of $75/80 to $125 per barrel. They recognize that anything at the upper end of that price range starts to have an effect on demand. They recognize that the world economy continues to be fragile and it's in no one's best interest including their own to scupper that recovery." "We believe that, over time, OPEC would be very happy to manage the oil price back down below $100 and that something between $80-$100, more likely toward the top end of that range in the shorter term, is what OPEC would be happy to see." MARK THOMAS, HEAD OF ENERGY EUROPE, MAREX FINANCIAL: "Increasing (the) official quota in reality changes nothing. It merely legitimizes increased production to cover lost Libyan output. (The) net effect is zero and does not bring more oil to the market. OPEC is using smoke and mirrors to give the impression they are supplying additional oil. In reality they are not. It makes no difference (to the global economy). They are already doing it (producing oil above quota)." CHRISTOPHER BELLOW, OIL BROKER, BACHE COMMODITIES: "If (the delegate) is Saudi, it carries considerable credibility. If it is Ecuador, for example, then it is less convincing. As OPEC are already producing about 1 million bpd over their official quota, any increase might not actually lead to any more oil coming to the market." "But I am not convinced that OPEC intends to increase the supply of oil from current levels. I think it will take higher prices than these to lead to a real production hike." EDWARD MEIR, SENIOR COMMOTITY ANALYST, MF GLOBAL: "The markets have not reacted much to the announcement, but we suspect that additional downward pressure could materialize if in fact this turns out to be the case."
