 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The U.S. government has not formally raised Google Inc's latest allegations of hacking with the Chinese government because the incident is still under investigation, the U.S. State Department said on Thursday. 

 "We have not (raised the case), as far as I'm aware," State Department spokesman Mark Toner told reporters, saying the government would await results of the investigation into the incident being undertaken by Google and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
