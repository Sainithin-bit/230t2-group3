 ATHENS  (Reuters) - Greece's international lenders plan to issue a statement on Friday on the country's progress in cutting its budget deficit, but they will not say if Athens will get aid beyond the current bailout deal, sources said. 

 "The (EU/IMF/ECB) troika plans to conclude talks later today and issue a joint statement on Friday," one source close to the talks told Reuters on Thursday. Another source close to the talks said the statement would focus exclusively on whether Greece is meeting fiscal and privatization targets under the current 110 billion euro bailout agreed in May last year. "It will be about the fourth review (of Greece's progress in meeting its bailout targets), while anything that could follow concerning a possible additional program is for the days to come," the source said. "These questions are more political and will be dealt with at the level of finance ministers and advisers," the source said, adding that Greece's international lenders hoped to conclude these talks this month.
