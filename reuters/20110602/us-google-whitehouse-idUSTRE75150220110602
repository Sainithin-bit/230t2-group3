 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - There is no reason to believe official U.S. government email accounts were accessed by what Google Inc has said was a hacking attempt, the White House said on Thursday. 

 Google said on Wednesday unknown hackers likely originating from central China tried to get into the Gmail accounts of hundreds of users, including senior U.S. government officials. White House spokesman Jay Carney said the administration was taking an "all government approach" to addressing such intrusions. (Reporting by  Jeff Mason  and  Caren Bohan ; Editing by  Vicki Allen )
