 (Reuters) - Online coupon company Groupon Inc filed for an initial public offering on Thursday, the latest in a series of Internet companies to tap the U.S. capital markets. 

 Here are some key facts about Groupon: * Launched in November 2008, headquarters in Chicago * 83.1 million subscribers in 43 countries as of June 1, 2011 * Offers members discounts on meals, travel, goods and services * Takes a commission of 30 percent to 50 percent from the merchants who provide the services * Sold more than 70 million coupons as of June 1, 2011 * Had 7,107 employees as of March 31, 2011 * Q1 2011 revenue: $644.7 million, gross profit $270 million, net loss $146.5 million * 2010 revenue: $713.4 million, gross profit $280 million, net loss $456.3 million * Co-founder and Chief Executive Andrew Mason in S-1: "As with any business in a 30-month-old industry, the path to success will have twists and turns, moments of brilliance and other moments of sheer stupidity. Knowing that this will at times be a bumpy ride, we thank you for considering joining us." * S-1 risk factors include: "Our business is highly competitive. Competition presents an ongoing threat to the success of our business. "We are dependent on some of our existing or potential competitors, including Facebook, Google and Microsoft, for banner advertisements and other marketing initiatives to acquire new subscribers. Our ability to utilize their platforms to acquire new subscribers may be adversely affected if they choose to compete more directly with us."
