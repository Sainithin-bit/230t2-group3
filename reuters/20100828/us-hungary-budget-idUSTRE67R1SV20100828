 JACKSON HOLE, Wyoming  (Reuters) - Hungary's new government must act to anchor fiscal expectations and will be rewarded by the markets if it gets its house in order, the head of the country's independent budget watchdog said Saturday. 

 Hungary has the key elements to cement expectations, courtesy of an inflation target on the monetary policy side and a statutory debt ceiling on the fiscal side, Gyorgy Kopits, chairman of Hungary's Fiscal Council, said on the sidelines of the U.S. Federal Reserve's annual economic symposium here. These should provide the pillars for an overarching policy that anchors expectations and sows confidence, he said. While it is understandable for a new government, such as the ruling Fidezs party elected in Hungary earlier this year, to resort to "stop gap measures," markets have no patience for it in the current environment. "Unfortunately what's happening is that you lose a lot by not anchoring expectations in the fiscal area," Kopits said in an interview with Reuters Insider. On Friday, yields on 10-year Hungarian debt moved above 500 basis points over comparable German bunds and five-year credit default swaps widened to more than 350 basis points. The forint dropped by a quarter of a percent. The government earlier this month jolted markets by breaking off talks with lenders about a joint International Monetary Fund European Union loan program that expires in October. A government spokesman on Thursday said the government has not requested a date to restart talks. Kopits said he had no information on the IMF situation because he heads an independent fiscal authority. Markets "are jitterish, they don't know where the next land mine is going to explode. They don't know what's happening, and there is very low tolerance for even a new government to take the reins on and to really outline a full fiscal strategy," Kopits said. "This is why in fact this government, with some of the initial steps it took, was not necessarily applauded by the financial markets, but in the next step there will be tremendous opportunity." That next step is in outlining a 2011 budget. "This coming budget, the 2011 budget, is going to be a very important milestone particularly for a new government, it is its first budget and it has a chance to really outline a fiscal strategy not just for 2011 but for its full term, which is four years." Kopits reiterated that the budget deficit for this year would probably be about 4 percent of gross domestic product, slightly above the target of 3.8 percent of GDP. But the budget is "within the range of error," and the target is still "tenable, achievable," he said. That repeats a budget outline Kopits provided 10 days ago.
