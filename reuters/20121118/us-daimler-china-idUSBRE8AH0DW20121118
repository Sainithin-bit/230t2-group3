 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - German luxury carmaker Daimler ( DAIGn.DE ) will enlarge its management board to put a top executive in charge of its troublesome Chinese car business, a German magazine reported on Sunday. 
 The additional eighth executive board seat will be created at the group's upcoming supervisory board meeting, weekly Der Spiegel reported, without specifying its sources. A Daimler spokesman declined to comment. Daimler's flagship car brand Mercedes lags larger German premium names BMW ( BMWG.DE ) and Audi ( VOWG_p.DE ) in China.
