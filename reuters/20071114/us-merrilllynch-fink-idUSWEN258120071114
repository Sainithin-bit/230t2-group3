 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Merrill Lynch & Co Inc MER.N on Wednesday said it did not offer the job of chief executive to BlackRock Inc ( BLK.N ) CEO Larry Fink. 

 A Merrill Lynch spokeswoman told Reuters the CEO job has not been offered to Fink as speculation mounts that NYSE Euronext NYX.N CEO John Thain will be tapped to replace Stan O'Neal, former Merrill Lynch CEO. Earlier on Wednesday, CNBC said Merrill approached Fink about taking the top job at the brokerage, and he accepted. But only on the condition Merrill provide Fink with a thorough accounting of the company's exposure to risky subprime loans. CNBC said that when Merrill was faced with that demand, the company opted to seek out Thain for the job. Merrill declined to comment on reports that Thain has been offered the job.
