 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - NYSE Euronext NYX.N named Duncan Niederauer as its new chief executive, after former CEO John Thain agreed to take the top job at Merrill Lynch & Co MER.N. 

 Niederauer, 48, joined the exchange as president and co-chief operating officer from Goldman Sachs ( GS.N ) in April. Niederauer, who spent 22 years at Goldman, was responsible for the exchange's U.S. floor trading and electronic trading business. "We have a well-defined business strategy in place, and I look forward to continuing to work with our global team and our customers in the years ahead," Niederauer said in a statement. Niederauer's appointment is subject to the approval of the European College of Regulators, as per NYSE Group's merger agreement with European exchanges operator Euronext NV.
