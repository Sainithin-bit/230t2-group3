 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve said on Wednesday it will make economic projections for longer periods and distribute them more often in an effort to shed light on the likely path of interest rates and optimal levels of inflation. 

 The Fed will release economic projections four times a year instead of two and policy-makers' projections will cover three years instead of two, the U.S. central bank said in a statement. "Providing more information about these forecasts, including discussions of the factors underlying the forecasts and of (Fed) participants' assessments of the risks to the committee's objectives, should improve the public's understanding of the rationale for the current stance of monetary policy and any changes to that stance," Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke said in remarks prepared for delivery to the Cato Institute.
