 RIYADH  (Reuters) - OPEC sees no need to increase oil 
production at the moment, Secretary-General Abdullah al-Badri 
said on Wednesday, rejecting a U.S. appeal to boost output 
sooner than the producer group's meeting next month. 

  U.S. Energy Secretary Samuel Bodman said on Tuesday he had 
asked the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to 
agree as early as this week to increase oil production to 
tackle falling inventory levels and high crude prices.  But OPEC officials have said they will not act on policy at 
this week's heads of state summit in Riyadh, reserving 
discussion until they meet formally in Abu Dhabi on December 5.  "I would like to say to the Energy Secretary... that we 
don't want to see any shortage in supply, that this question 
will be raised in our meeting in Abu Dhabi," Badri told a news 
conference ahead of an OPEC heads of state summit in the Saudi 
capital.  "At this time, frankly, we don't see that we should add 
more oil, but this is up to the ministers to decide."  Badri said there was no reason for oil to reach $100, as it 
almost did last week, and continued to blame refinery 
bottlenecks, geopolitical issues and the weak U.S. dollar for 
oil's ascent from below $70 a barrel in mid-August.  "As far as we are concerned, as far as fundamentals are 
concerned, there is really no reason for prices to go to $100."  "We don't want to interfere with consumer countries' 
policy. If there is a shortage we want to see if we can supply 
that shortage," he said. "We are frustrated with the idea that 
we have something to do with this (high oil prices)."  (Reporting by  Alex Lawler  and  Simon Webb ; Writing by
