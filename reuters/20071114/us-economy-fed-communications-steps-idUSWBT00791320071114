 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said on Wednesday that steps announced by the U.S. central bank to improve transparency marked just "a step on the road" and that it was open to considering further measures. 

 "This is a step on the road. We are going to continue to look for ways to improve transparency," Bernanke said when asked whether steps announced on Wednesday would be compatible with the adoption of an inflation target in the future. "We are open both to trying to improve the presentation and quality of this particular measure and we are always open to thinking about further steps with regard to transparency," he said.
