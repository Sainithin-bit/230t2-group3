 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Billionaire investor Sam Zell is committed to his $8.2 billion plan to buy out Tribune Co TRB.N despite its opposition to a plan by a top government regulator to change media ownership rules that affect the deal's outcome, a source familiar with the matter said Wednesday. 

 Tribune Chief Executive Dennis FitzSimons told employees in a memo on Tuesday that the plan by U.S. Federal Communications Commission Chairman Kevin Martin, which would relax a ban on owning news and broadcast stations in the same market, is too limited. The proposal affects companies with properties in the top 20 U.S. markets, but if approved, it could force Tribune to sell some of its properties in Hartford Connecticut, where it owns the Hartford Courant newspaper and two television stations. The plan also could work in Tribune's favor by making it easier for the company to transfer waivers to Zell that allow it to skirt the current rules by owning newspapers and TV stations in some of its markets.
