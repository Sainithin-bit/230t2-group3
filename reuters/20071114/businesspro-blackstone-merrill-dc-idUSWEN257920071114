 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Blackstone Group LP ( BX.N ) CEO Stephen 
Schwarzman said on Wednesday the firm could earn a lot more 
than estimated earnings of around $1 billion to $2 billion per 
year, which he said could be "dramatically wrong." 

  Schwarzman said last quarter alone the firm invested $6.9 
billion through its private equity and real estate divisions.  The earnings power through carried interest "is stunning," 
Schwarzman said, speaking at a Merrill Lynch & Co. banking 
conference on Wednesday. Carried interest is the profit earned 
on money invested.  He said the money that Blackstone invests in one year, 
assuming certain factors, could theoretically yield profits of 
$8 billion.  (Reporting by  Michael Flaherty , editing by Phil Berlowitz)
