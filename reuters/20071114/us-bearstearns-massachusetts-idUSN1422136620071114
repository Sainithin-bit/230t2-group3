 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Massachusetts' top securities regulator on Wednesday accused Bear Stearns Cos Inc of improper trading in two in-house hedge funds that collapsed because of wrong-way bets on risky mortgage holdings. 

 The administrative complaint filed by the state's Secretary of the Commonwealth, William Galvin, contends that Bear Stearns engaged in related party trades involving the funds and other company entities that did not receive approval from the funds' independent directors as required. While Bear assured investors that proper disclosures were in place, these controls "did not survive the daily ordeals of trading and managing and leveraging," the complaint contends. The alleged violations "begin to explain, in a broader way, how the subprime crisis was fueled," Galvin told Reuters in a telephone interview. "It was fueled by large brokerage houses such as this violating their own procedures." A Bear Stearns spokesman declined to comment. Bear's High-Grade Structured Credit Strategies Fund and the High-Grade Structured Enhanced Leverage Fund imploded this summer, wiping out about investments of about $1.6 billion. The funds had bought collateralized debt obligations -- bonds made up of repackaged mortgages including risky subprime loans -- which collapsed as homeowner defaults surged. The funds had invested through special purpose entities that were structured by the managers of the funds themselves, and the funds also bought and sold securities from related entities at Bear, Galvin said. Because of the potential for conflicts of interest, the funds were required by federal law and through their own offering documents to get consent from the independent directors before a deal could be settled, the complaint said. Referring to the High-Grade Structured Credit fund, the complaint said that in 2006, almost 79 percent of the transactions that required prior approval did not receive it. Almost 59 percent lacked such approval in 2005, and 30 percent in 2004, according to the complaint. Galvin contends his office has jurisdiction in the case because the two hedge funds had investors based in Massachusetts. He is seeking an unspecified fine imposed on Bear, among other relief. The state regulator opened an investigation in March into Bear Stearns' research analysis on subprime lenders. He later expanded the probe to examine whether trades in the investment bank's hedge funds had been priced fairly. Bear Stearns has said previously that it has been contacted by various state and federal regulators and law enforcement authorities regarding the two failed funds. Last month, the Wall Street Journal reported that federal prosecutors in New York's borough of Brooklyn had launched a criminal probe into the matter. The High-Grade Structured Credit fund's original unaffiliated directors were located in Dublin, but were replaced by two directors from Walkers Fund Services in the Cayman Islands in 2006, according to the complaint. The complaint questioned their independence, saying they already were engaged with Bear Stearns Asset Management in other legal and business relationships. Also, "by consistently choosing unaffiliated directors who were domiciled outside the United States, BSAM effectively shielded those unaffiliated directors from accountability for the essential duties they were to perform for investors in the funds," the complaint said. The Massachusetts Securities Division, a unit of Galvin's office, issued subpoenas and scheduled interviews for the two Walkers directors during its investigation, but they did not appear for questioning because they said the division lacked jurisdiction in the Cayman Islands, the complaint said. A lawyer for investors who have brought arbitration cases against Bear over their losses in one of the hedge funds said that the regulatory complaint will help bolster his client's claims. "The apparent failure to obtain independent approval from outside directors is a serious breach of the offering documents, and these are omissions that we would find fraudulent," said Ross Intelisano, a partner at law firm Rich & Intelisano in New York.
