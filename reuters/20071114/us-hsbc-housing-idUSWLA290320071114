 LONDON  (Reuters) - Europe's biggest bank HSBC Holdings ( HSBA.L ) said a further weakening in the U.S. housing market could see its consumer finance bad debts continue to rise, after it unveiled a jump in its third quarter charge. 

 "If the housing market continues to weaken and if it has a broader impact on the underlying real economy then charges will stay elevated and could increase," HSBC Finance Director Douglas Flint told reporters on a conference call. HSBC said the outlook was "genuinely uncertain". It increased its bad debt charge related to its U.S. consumer finance business to $3.4 billion for the third quarter after a deterioration in the subprime housing market, but revenue growth elsewhere in the bank offset the impact and the third quarter profits were ahead of a year ago. Stephen Green, HSBC chairman, said the bank was "very comfortable" with its 19 percent holding in China's Bank of Communications ( 3328.HK ), and said authorities had indicated they were happy for it to return to the 19.9 percent stake it held before the stake was diluted when BoCom floated shares on the Shanghai market.
