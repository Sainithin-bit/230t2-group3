 LONDON  (Reuters) - British gas storage firm Star Energy Group Plc STAR.L is to receive a 340 million pound ($706 million) takeover approach from Malaysian oil & gas company Petronas, sending its shares up 30 percent. 

 State-owned Petronas said in a statement on Wednesday it had bought 10 percent of Star shares at 365 pence each, bringing its total holding to 39 percent, and would now make an offer for the rest of the group. "Petronas has been a long term investor of Star Energy and is supportive of the management's strategic plan," President and Chief Executive Tan Sri Hassan Marican said in a statement. The group added that the price was a 30 percent premium to Star's closing price on Tuesday, and a 50 percent premium to the average price for the three months up to that date. Star shares were up 27.8 percent at 359 pence at 4:43 a.m. EST, valuing it at 333 million pounds. Star has five gas storage sites onshore UK, and one offshore in conjunction with oil & gas minnow EnCore Oil EO.L. Gas storage is considered potentially valuable for when extreme weather conditions or security concerns hamper supply, allowing the company's stored gas to be sold into the market at higher prices. "Petronas understands the importance of gas storage projects to the long term security of gas supply in the UK, and aims to ensure the projects are developed to their full potential," Maricam added. EnCore told Reuters last month that the gas storage joint venture with Star was potentially worth more that its core exploration business, and it may seek to demerge it. Star declined comment.
