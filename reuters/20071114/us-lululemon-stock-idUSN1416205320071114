 OTTAWA  (Reuters) - Shares of Lululemon Athletica ( LULU.O ) LLL.TO sank on Wednesday but then rebounded as investors shrugged off a newspaper report that disputed claims that the company's yoga wear was made with fabric that contained health-boosting seaweed. 

 The trendy clothier, a stock market darling since its July market debut, says its Vitasea fabric line includes seaweed fiber that releases amino acids, minerals and vitamins into the skin on contact with moisture. It also says the workout wear will lower stress and provide anti-inflammatory, hydrating and detoxifying benefits. Not so, says the New York Times, which commissioned its own test after a Lululemon investor, who is shorting its stock, supplied the paper with lab results. Both tests concluded there was no major difference in mineral levels between the Vitasea fabric and a plain cotton T-shirt. "In other words, the labs found no evidence of seaweed in the Lululemon clothing," the newspaper said. Analysts and customers were split on how badly the news will hurt the company. Some viewed this as a growing pain that won't keep shoppers away from the form-fitting clothes. Others said it brings the health-conscious company's brand into question. "It reveals a risk of them growing so fast that they obviously didn't have a handle on what their fabric actually was," Accountability Research Corp. analyst Mark Rosen said. "It's a warning sign (and) could be indicative of other areas that might also run into some speed bumps along the way." The much-hyped chain, which recently bumped up its third-quarter forecast on strong sales and a rising Canadian dollar, is on a growth tear. It plans to add up 25 new stores this year and as many as 35 in 2008. An executive at the company, which has built a dedicated following for its high-end clothes, did not return a call for comment. Nor did its investor relations agency. Lululemon shares bottomed at $39.75 on Nasdaq, a drop of nearly 9 percent, before recovering in a late-session rally to close at $44.29, a gain of 79 cents. On the Toronto Stock Exchange, the stock ended at C$42.80, adding 3 percent, or  C$1.30. In late October the stock rose as high as $60.70, a huge jump from the $18 issue price when the Vancouver, British Columbia-based company went public. "If Lululemon's claim proves to be false, we believe this controversy could challenge its strong brand image, authenticity and loyal cult following," Blackmont Capital analyst Barbara Gray said in a note. "(That) could expose it to pricing risk, forcing it to incur marketing costs to restore its brand and could put its aggressive retail expansion efforts at risk." Rosen said seaweed clothing likely represents a modest portion of sales, but the company could face a backlash. "A certain segment of their customer base is going to want an answer as to why they're not getting their seaweed," he said. "I don't think the intent was there to mislead, so it's more that they  have to explain how this screw-up happened and what they're going to do to fix it." Seaweed fiber is provided to Lululemon by SeaCell, which is owned by German company Smartfiber, and supplies a range of clothing and bedding manufacturers. Lululemon customer Dale Morris said she would be less likely to pick up the pricey clothes if the company's seaweed claims are false. "Part of the reason I'm willing to pay extra, for what essentially ends up being comfort wear, at Lululemon, is because of the theoretically advanced technology that they've applied to clothing," she said. "Do I really think the clothing's going to make me healthier as a person? Probably not, but hey, if it does, it's a bonus. However, I'm not keen to pay extra if it's all marketing."
