 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Roche Holding AG's ( ROG.VX ) $3 billion bid to acquire Ventana Medical Systems Inc VMSI.O seemed to take a friendlier turn on Tuesday when the two sides struck a confidentiality agreement. 

 The Arizona-based diagnostics company said it continued to believe the Swiss healthcare group's $75-a-share takeover offer was "grossly inadequate" but hopes giving access to non-public information will encourage Roche to hike its offer. "Ventana's board believes that the due diligence conducted by Roche and related discussions that will accompany the due diligence process will allow Roche to recognize the significant additional value inherent in Ventana's business," the U.S. company said in a statement. Both companies said there was no assurance that any deal would be concluded. A spokeswoman for Ventana declined to comment further. The chief executives of both Roche and Ventana had told the Reuters Health Summit in New York just a day earlier that neither side was ready to budge. Roche Chief Executive Officer Franz Humer said the Swiss company was not willing to pay more than its current offer of $75 per share, which his Ventana counterpart Christopher Gleeson maintained was a "non-starter." Some analysts have said Ventana could be worth up to $90 per share as a stand-alone business and Roche may have to raise its bid -- possibly above $100 -- to ensure success. Roche is particularly interested in Ventana because it makes diagnostics tests which could speed up detection and profiling of cancer and enhance use of targeted therapies, such as Roche's blockbuster drug Herceptin. Roche last month extended its offer for a fourth time, but Ventana maintains the current bid undervalues its business and recommends shareholders not tender any of their stock to Roche. Ventana shares rose on Roche's initial cash offer in June, which represented a 44 percent premium to the value investors had previously assigned to the company. Shares in Ventana closed up 2 cents to $84.18 on the Nasdaq on Tuesday. Merrill Lynch and Goldman Sachs are acting as financial advisers to Ventana. Roche is being advised by Greenhill & Co and Citigroup. (Additional reporting by  Ben Hirschler  and  Lisa Baertlein , editing by Jeffrey Benkoe and Carol Bishopric)
