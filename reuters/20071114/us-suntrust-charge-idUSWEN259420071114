 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - SunTrust Banks Inc ( STI.N ), the seventh-largest U.S. bank, said on Wednesday it expects to incur a $26 million fourth-quarter charge for its share of Visa Inc's $2.1 billion antitrust settlement with American Express Co ( AXP.N ). 

 Several other U.S. banks have also reduced previously reported third-quarter earnings or projected fourth-quarter results for Visa's November 7 settlement. Analysts on average expected SunTrust to post a fourth-quarter profit of $1.45 per share, according to Reuters Estimates. SunTrust disclosed the expected charge in a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing. (Reporting by Jonathan Stempel; Editing by  Leslie Gevirtz )
