 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. retail sales rose by a sluggish 0.2 percent in October and producer prices edged up only slightly, according to data on Wednesday that may give the Federal Reserve more leeway to prop up a slowing economy. 

 The modest retail sales gain reported by the Commerce Department matched economists' expectations, as a housing downturn and steep oil prices constrained consumer spending. Separately, the Labor Department said the producer price index, a gauge of prices paid at the farm and factory gate, rose 0.1 percent in October, while core prices -- which strip out volatile food and energy costs -- were unchanged. Stocks dipped on Wednesday amid concerns about whether the U.S. economy could withstand the triple threat of housing, high oil prices and tightening credit. The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 0.62 percent at 13,223. Economic growth concerns also weighed on the dollar, while bond prices rose slightly. Economists and the Fed expect the economy to slow after a surprisingly robust third quarter. But high oil and food costs have raised concerns that the central bank may be reluctant to cut interest rates further for fear of stoking inflation. Wednesday's data "leaves the door more open for the Fed to do more (interest-rate) cutting," said Robert Macintosh, chief economist at Eaton Vance Corp. in Boston. "Inflation's not an issue and consumers continue to pull back on their activity." "If the consumer really pulls back, then you are talking about a recession," he added. Yet some analysts said the tame inflation reading may prove fleeting as the data did not fully reflect a steep oil price rally in late October. Oil futures flirted with the psychologically significant $100 per barrel mark last week. The inflation report also may have been skewed by automakers' shift to a new model year, which has a tendency to throw off calculations, and perhaps understates inflation. "The October data on retail sales showed modest growth, not an implosion. Nonetheless, there is softness in core retail sales, which points to weak consumption growth in the fourth quarter," said Michael Darda, chief economist at MKM Partners. "Overall inflation should be strong in the fourth quarter, however, creating a whiff of stagflation," he added. Investors on Thursday will get a look at how inflationary pressures are affecting consumers when the Labor Department releases its Consumer Price Index for October. Economists are looking for a 0.3 percent increase. In a separate report on Wednesday, the Commerce Department said business inventories rose 0.4 percent in September, which may also point to slower growth ahead as businesses work to pare bloated stocks. SILVER LINING The central bank has said it expects fourth-quarter economic growth to slow from the surprisingly strong annual rate of 3.9 percent posted in the third quarter, and it will watch the data closely for signs of further deterioration. Economists polled by Reuters had widely expected retail sales growth to slow from September's pace as consumer confidence sank under the weight of the housing slide, rising oil prices and tougher credit conditions. Investors are watching retail sales data closely for signs that consumers are caving, which would deal a severe blow to the already shaky U.S. economy. Consumer spending accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity. "The silver lining to the slowdown in consumption spending is a reduction in the rate of growth of imports, a prospective rise in the savings rate and downward pressure on core inflation," said Global Insight U.S. economist Brian Bethune. "This should alleviate the inflation risks that were recently flagged by the Federal Reserve." Sales at home furnishing stores declined 0.9 percent last month as the housing slump took its toll, while gasoline stations posted a 0.8 percent increase. Excluding autos, October sales rose 0.2 percent, a shade below economists' forecast for an increase of 0.3 percent. On the inflation front, the PPI data showed energy prices fell 0.8 percent in October after a 4.1 percent rise in September. Prices for light trucks, which include slow-selling sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks, fell 2.7 percent. Core prices excluding cars and light trucks rose 0.2 percent in October.
