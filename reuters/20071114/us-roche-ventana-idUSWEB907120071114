 NEW YORK/ZURICH  (Reuters) - Roche Holding AG's ( ROG.VX ) $3 billion bid for Ventana Medical Systems Inc VMSI.O has taken a friendlier turn, with the two sides striking a confidentiality pact that analysts said may lead to a deal. 

 The Arizona-based diagnostics company said late on Tuesday it continued to believe the Swiss healthcare group's $75-a-share takeover offer was "grossly inadequate" but it hopes giving access to non-public information will encourage Roche to hike its offer. "Ventana's board believes that the due diligence conducted by Roche and related discussions that will accompany the due diligence process will allow Roche to recognize the significant additional value inherent in Ventana's business," the U.S. company said in a statement. Roche later confirmed the confidentiality agreement but both companies said there was no assurance that any deal would be concluded. Officials declined to comment further. Industry analysts, however, said it now looked likely Roche would win its prize with a sweetened bid. "This has to raise the chances of a deal being agreed," analysts at Dresdner Kleinwort said in a note on Wednesday. "It is unlikely to be at Roche's original offer price and game theory -- and the current Ventana stock price -- would suggest that the offer would have to be raised." NOT BUDGING The chief executives of both Roche and Ventana had told the Reuters Health Summit in New York on Monday that neither side was ready to budge. Roche Chief Executive Officer Franz Humer said the Swiss company was not willing to pay more than its current offer of $75 per share, which his Ventana counterpart Christopher Gleeson maintained was a "non-starter." Some analysts have said Ventana could be worth up to $90 per share as a stand-alone business and Roche may have to raise its bid -- possibly above $100 -- to ensure success. Roche is particularly interested in Ventana because it makes diagnostics tests which could speed up detection and profiling of cancer and enhance use of targeted therapies, such as Roche's blockbuster drug Herceptin. Roche last month extended its offer for a fourth time, but Ventana maintains the current bid undervalues its business and recommends shareholders not tender any of their stock to Roche. Ventana shares rose on Roche's initial cash offer in June, which represented a 44 percent premium to the value investors had previously assigned to the company. Shares in Ventana closed up 2 cents to $84.18 on the Nasdaq on Tuesday. Roche stock was up 2 percent at 199 Swiss francs in early afternoon trade in Zurich. Merrill Lynch and Goldman Sachs are acting as financial advisers to Ventana. Roche is being advised by Greenhill & Co and Citigroup.
