 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - AT&T Inc ( T.N ) plans on Wednesday to introduce a nationwide program giving owners of small- and medium-size businesses some of the same tools big security firms offer for remotely monitoring employees, customers and operations, the New York Times said in its online edition. 

 Under AT&T's Remote Monitor program, a business owner could install adjustable cameras, door sensors and other gadgets at up to five different company locations across the country, the newspaper reported. Using a Java-enabled mobile device or a personal computer connected to the Internet, the owner would be able to view any of the images in real time, control room lighting and track equipment temperatures remotely, the Times said. All the images are recorded on digital video which can be viewed for up to 30 days, the newspaper added. According to the Times, equipment costs range from $199 for a fixed camera starter kit in a single location, to $349 for multiple cameras including ones that will pan or tilt. The newspaper also said monthly monitoring charges range from $9.95 for a single location, to $39.95 for five locations. Representatives from AT&T could not immediately be reached for comment.
