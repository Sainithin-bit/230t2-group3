 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - E*Trade Financial Corp ( ETFC.O ) Chief Executive Mitch Caplan categorically ruled out the possibility of bankruptcy on Wednesday, days after an analyst said mounting credit losses and the potential loss of customer assets might make the discount brokerage insolvent. 

 "We're here to stay," Caplan told CNBC, the business news channel. Caplan, who canceled a scheduled presentation at a Merrill Lynch banking conference Wednesday, said the company still has "real" balance sheet issues, but its retail franchise remains in "phenomenal" shape. E*Trade shares fell 59 percent on Monday after a Citigroup analyst warned it faces a 15 percent chance of bankruptcy, but recovered a portion of their value over the last two days. The stock closed Wednesday at $5.54, up 54 cents, or 10.8 percent, on Nasdaq. It hit a 52-week high of $26.08 last January. Caplan called the bankruptcy speculation "sensational" and said the suggestion by Citigroup analyst Prashant Bhatia that there may be a run on the bank "is irresponsible to our customers, our employees." He said E*Trade's balance sheet is likely to shrink, but will have no impact on downsizing the business. The company remains well capitalized and will be able to resolve all its problems, either through a partnership or relationship, Caplan said. He said he remains "bearish" and sees a broader market downturn for the next 12 to 18 months. (Reporting by  Anupreeta Das ; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe)
