 ATLANTA  (Reuters) - Department store operator Macy's Inc ( M.N ) reported a better-than-expected third-quarter profit on Wednesday on lower costs but cut its sales forecast for the current quarter and full year, sending its shares down 4 percent. 

 Retail watchers have expressed concern about the impact the slumping U.S. housing market and higher gasoline prices could have on consumer spending heading into the holiday season. "The company did beat" estimates, said Brian Sozzi, a retail analyst with Wall Street Strategies. "But fleshing out those details, I don't think the quarter was strong enough to warrant a sustained upward movement in the stock based on the macro trends." Kohl's Corp ( KSS.N ), one of Macy's department-store rivals, said in recent months that the housing woes have hurt its business. Kohl's cut its third-quarter earnings estimates last week. Macy's posted net income of $33 million, or 8 cents a share, for the third quarter, ended November 3, compared with a loss of $3 million, or 1 cent a share, a year earlier. Excluding merger costs of $10 million, or 2 cents a share, the parent of Macy's and Bloomingdale's earned 10 cents a share, more than the 8 cents expected by analysts polled by Reuters Estimates. In the year-earlier quarter, after-tax merger costs came to $90 million, or 17 cents a share. Total sales rose 0.3 percent to $5.91 billion, while sales at stores open at least one fiscal year fell 0.8 percent. Macy's, formerly called Federated Department Stores, acquired May Department Stores in 2005 and converted more than 400 of those outlets to the Macy's name last year. In recent months, it boosted promotions to spur traffic at those newer stores, where sales have fallen short of expectations. "The integration has not gone ... smoothly," said David Heupel, a portfolio manager with Thrivent Investment Management. "You got to get the consumer in, you got to get them to shop and you got to have (same-store sales) improve. That's going to take some time." HOME SALES IMPROVE During a conference call, Macy's Chief Financial Officer Karen Hoguet said business strengthened at many ex-May stores during the quarter, partly aided by better home-goods sales as the company launched an exclusive line of Martha Stewart products. She also added that business in general "has improved with the colder weather." Sales of sweaters and coats has been held down by warmer temperatures in recent months. Gross margin shrank to 39.3 percent in the quarter, compared with 40.3 percent a year earlier, as Macy's marked down goods to keep inventories current. The Cincinnati-based retailer forecast fourth-quarter profit of $1.70 to $1.80 a share excluding merger costs on sales of $8.7 billion to $8.9 billion, down from a previous sales forecast of $8.8 billion to $9 billion. Analysts currently expect profit of $1.74 a share for the fourth quarter on sales of $8.93 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. Macy's said it now expects sales for the year of $26.4 billion to $26.6 billion, down from the range of $26.5 billion to $26.8 billion given in August. In a research note, JPMorgan analyst Charles Grom said Macy's now expects merger-related costs of $60 million to $70 million for the fourth quarter, "meaningfully higher" than a prior forecast of $10 million. Hoguet said the higher merger costs for the fourth period partly reflect the company's underestimation of non-cash integration expenses it would incur. Hoguet also said that Macy's might defer some or most of the $1 billion remaining in its stock repurchase program into next year, citing current U.S. credit market volatility. Macy's shares were down $1.36, or 4.4 percent, to $29.29 in afternoon New York Stock Exchange trading after rising as much as 3 percent at the start of the session. So far this year, the stock is down 23 percent. (Reporting by Karen Jacobs; Editing by  Derek Caney )
