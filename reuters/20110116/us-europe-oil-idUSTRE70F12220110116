 LONDON  (Reuters) - The UK and Europe's weakest economies are looking most at risk from a surge in crude oil to near $100 a barrel that threatens a nascent recovery. 

 The higher costs of everything from gasoline to heating oil, jet fuel and the myriad of products that have an oil component is a tax on growth at a time when prospects for recovery in these countries are so fragile. While few analysts see oil returning to its high of $147 hit in 2008 because of oil producers' excess capacity, crude prices do represent a threat to the global economy and particularly to Europe at levels even well below that. "Whenever the size of the energy sector in the global economy reached 9 percent, we went into a major crisis," said Sabine Schels, a commodity analyst at Merrill Lynch. "It was in the 1980s and it was the same in 2008. Right now we are at about 7.8 percent and if you go above $100 per barrel to $120 per barrel, you get to that 9 percent level." Rising oil prices may increase pressure on the Bank of England to raise interest rates to offset already high inflation, some economists said. The weakness of the euro due to the euro zone's debt crisis will also make the higher oil price more difficult to swallow in weak economies such as Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Spain. By contrast, Switzerland and some East European nations will be able to sustain the pressures due to strong currencies which alleviate the effects of dollar-denominated oil prices rises. "A couple of years ago when we had very high inflation because of oil and utility bills, the Bank of England was able to look through it," said BNP Paribas economist Alan Clarke. "But it's much harder to look through it now, when headline inflation is over 3 percent," Clarke said. The BoE's last inflation forecast assumed 2011 oil price at under $90 a barrel. On Friday, Brent oil futures hit $99 per barrel and U.S. crude future were at around $90 with analysts predicting U.S. crude would breach $100 a barrel in the first quarter of 2011 PERIPHERAL WOES Oil at $100 a barrel would add about one percentage point to the headline UK rate of consumer price inflation with most of the impact coming from a steep rise in utility bills as natural gas prices are linked to oil, estimates Clarke. By contrast, Italian CPI moves more slowly than in most European states due to the disproportionate importance of excise duties. Electricity and gas prices are partly administered by the state while Italian inflation stood at 2.1 percent last year. For peripheral euro zone countries in general, the oil prices rally may not lead to an increased risk of bailouts as higher inflation could boost nominal GDP, possibly helping to reduce ratios of sovereign debt to GDP. But it will nevertheless undermine attempts to regain competitiveness in countries such as Portugal or Spain. "Purchasing power will be reduced and they are already suffering from poor labor growth prospects," said Marco Valli, chief euro zone economist at UniCredit. STRONG CURRENCIES Germany economy minister Rainer Bruederle said on Friday he saw no immediate threats for Germany and Europe in general. That echoed European Central Bank's President views that rates were still appropriate despite upward inflationary pressure including from energy prices Julian Callow, chief European economist at Barclay's Capital, said the eurozone's GDP growth could contract by 0.2 percentage points should oil prices stay at current levels. "However, we are not likely to see the end of price increases since they tend to first come to an end when there is either recession or significant monetary policy tightening -- neither of which is in sight," he said. Among the least hit by the oil spike economists name Switzerland which has seen a 16-percent appreciation of the franc against the dollar in the past six months amid low inflation. "The Swiss economy is certainly one of those economies that suffer the least," said Sarasin bank's analyst Alessandro Bee. Strong currencies will also help Poland, Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic. "There is a lot of positive momentum in growth, particularly in emerging Europe, which is benefiting hugely from German growth," said Koon Chow, a strategist at Barclays.
