 PHILADELPHIA  (Reuters) - J Crew Group Inc received no rival takeover bids during its "go shop" period and will remain with its original $2.86 billion buyout offer from TPG and Leonard Green, a source familiar with the situation said on Sunday. 

 Sears Holdings Corp, Urban Outfitters Incand at least two other private equity firms had been looking at the financial books of J Crew during the "go shop" period that allowed J Crew to solicit other suitors, sources previously told Reuters. (Reporting by  Jessica Hall , editing by Maureen Bavdek)
