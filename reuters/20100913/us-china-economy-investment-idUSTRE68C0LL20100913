 SHANGHAI  (Reuters) - China is currently in the process of revising its foreign investment catalog to expand the number of sectors for which foreign investment is encouraged or permitted, a senior official said on Monday. 

 Liu Yajun, Director-General of the  Ministry of Commerce's Foreign Investment Department, told a conference in Shanghai that the revised catalog would decrease the number of sectors that are restricted or off limits for foreign investors. Liu said China's stance of opening to foreign investment would not change, but that such investment needed to be mutually beneficial in order to be sustainable.
