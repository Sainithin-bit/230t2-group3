 WILMINGTON, Delaware  (Reuters) - Creditors of the Tribune Co want to sue Sam Zell for his leveraged buyout of the company, which they blame for wiping out their investment by sending the newspaper publisher into bankruptcy, according to court documents filed on Monday. 

 The official committee of unsecured creditors asked Delaware's bankruptcy court to allow it to sue Zell as well as others who had a role in the 2007 buyout, such as the board of directors, large shareholders and advisers. Tribune, which owns the Chicago Tribune and Los Angeles Times as well as television stations, filed for bankruptcy in 2008, less than a year after real estate developer Zell completed a leveraged buyout of the company. The company's bankruptcy has become mired in a battle among creditors over who is to blame for the company's failure. The case is In Re Tribune Co, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, District of Delaware, No. 08-13141. (Reporting by Tom Hals, editing by Maureen Bavdek)
