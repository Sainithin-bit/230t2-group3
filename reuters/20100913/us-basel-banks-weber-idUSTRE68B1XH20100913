 BASEL, Switzerland  (Reuters) - German Bundesbank President Axel Weber on Sunday said he welcomed the new "Basel III" bank capital rules agreed by global regulators. 

 "I am glad that it's been possible today to come to a consistent and challenging international framework for new minimum bank capital requirements," he said in a emailed statement. "The gradual transition phase will allow all banks to meet the higher minimum capital and liquidity requirements. Also, the special nature of German financial institutions was properly taken into account." (Reporting by Alexander Huebner; Writing by  Catherine Bosley ; Editing by  Andrew Torchia )
