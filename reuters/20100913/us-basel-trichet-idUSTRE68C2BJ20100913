 BASEL, Switzerland  (Reuters) - Following are comments by European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet at a news conference on Monday. 

 The news conference followed discussions involving central bankers from industrialized and major emerging countries at the Bank for International Settlements in Basel. ON BASEL III: "It is important not only because it is for the fundamental strengthening of capital standards but it is for long-term sustainability. "We have transition arrangements which will enable banks to meet these standards while supporting the economy on recovery. "In the present episode of global recovery, after this shock we had in the previous years, uncertainty is the enemy in a way. With this decision taken here yesterday we eliminate uncertainty in a large area which is a major contribution in consolidating the global economy. "It's a work in progress. It is a major decision. We have hard work to do. We have the issue of liquidity ratio and we have to work actively in this matter. At the level of G20 there are a number of other workshops. "It is up to the supervisors to control, with the maximum amount of energy, the respect for standards. I have full confidence ... U.S. authorities concerned and all the other authorities, in the implementing of the standards." ON WORLD ECONOMIC RECOVERY: "We see at a global level sustained growth in the emerging world which calls for vigilance. In terms of growth it is a high level of growth which looks sustained. It doesn't mean it's time for complacency. In the advanced economies we see with differences here and there growth which is certainly more modest. Modest growth in advanced economies and sustained growth in emerging economies. "We don't see any materialization on risks of deflation at the present moment (in advanced economies). "In the emerging component of the global economy, there is certainly a posture of vigilance from central banks in order to avoid inflation. We see no room for complacency. We see necessity to remain alert at the level of each of component of the global economy." "There is clearly a behavior of the emerging world in general which is quite impressive which calls for authorities concerned and the private sector to remain prudent. "We did not declare victory the profile of the recovery remains modest (in the euro zone). There is no point in talking about negative growth."
