 TAIPEI  (Reuters) - Primus Financial Holdings, one of the bidders for American International Group's Taiwan unit, will appeal the regulator's decision to block the deal, a newspaper reported on Monday. 

 Citing unidentified "top level" sources in Primus, the Economic Daily news said Primus did not want to give up on the Nan Shan unit and would also consider bidding again if AIG put the unit back on sale. Battery maker China Strategic Holdings Ltd and Primus bid $2.2 billion for Nan Shan, but regulators blocked the bid on the grounds that the two did not have experience in the insurance industry and lacked the ability to raise capital for future operations. The bidders have the option of appealing the decision if they all agree. Primus declined to comment on Monday. AIG's Taiwan-based media relations firm said the company had no new statement since its August 31 comment that said it was discussing how to proceed. China Strategic was not immediately available for comment. It said earlier this month in a statement that AIG had indicated it would end the sale agreement with the two. Primus Chief Executive Robert Morse told Reuters in an interview on September 2 that the buyers were still considering an appeal. The paper said that if AIG put Nan Shan on sale again, the price would be much lower because of projected losses of T$23 billion ($723 million) this year at Nan Shan.
