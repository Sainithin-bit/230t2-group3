 BANGALORE  (Reuters) - Hewlett-Packard Co, the world's top personal computer maker, said it agreed buy cybersecurity firm ArcSight Inc for $1.5 billion in cash. 

 The $43.50-a-share offer is a 24 percent premium to ArcSight's Friday close. The acquisition is expected to close by the end of the calendar year. ArcSight's shares closed at $35.10 on Friday on Nasdaq. The stock has gained about 24 percent in value since The Wall Street Journal reported that company had put itself up for sale on August 26.
