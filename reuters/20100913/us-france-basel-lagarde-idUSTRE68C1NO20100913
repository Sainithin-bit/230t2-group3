 OSLO  (Reuters) - French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde said on Monday that the Basel III banking rules agreement was a significant improvement on previous capital requirements and would allow economic growth. 

 "The agreement passed yesterday marks a significant improvement," Lagarde told Reuters on the sidelines of a jobs conference in the Norwegian capital about the Basel III deal. "We wanted an improvement in the quality and quantity of capital over a period of time that would allow growth and the financing of growth. This is excellent progress." (Reporting by Gwladys Fouche)
