 BASEL, Switzerland  (Reuters) - Germany won a key concession in Sunday's talks on new "Basel III" bank capital rules, receiving a 10-year phase-out period for a type of capital commonly held by its savings and cooperative banks but rarely used elsewhere. 

 Germany was the only member of the Basel Committee of banking supervisors and central bankers that refused to endorse a draft of the new rules in July, saying it did not take into account the special needs of its state-backed banking sector. At the heart of its objections was a form of non-voting bank capital known as "silent participations" that is common in Germany but rarely used in other countries. Most of this money is comprised of state funds provided as part of ownership agreements for publicly owned banks or in bailouts Germany carried out during the financial crisis. On Sunday, global regulators agreed to allow an extra 10 years from 2013 to phase out certain types of capital including non-voting bank capital such as Germany's silent participations. Bundesbank President Axel Weber welcomed the Basel III rules, saying they had addressed Germany's concerns. "The special nature of German financial institutions was properly taken into account," Weber said in an emailed statement. "The gradual transition phase will allow all banks to meet the higher minimum capital and liquidity requirements." The Association of German Public Sector Banks estimates that up to a third of the capital reserves of German savings banks, cooperative banks, private banks and landesbanks come in the form of silent participations, adding up to almost 50 billion euros ($64 billion). The new rules set by the global regulators on Sunday will force banks to more than triple the amount of top-quality capital they must hold in reserve.
