 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Wachovia Corp. WB.N, the No. 4 U.S. bank, said on Tuesday that fourth-quarter profit rose 35 percent, helped by growth in fees and the acquisition of Golden West Financial Corp. 

 Net income for the Charlotte, North Carolina-based company rose to $2.3 billion, or $1.20 per share, from $1.71 billion, or $1.09 a share, a year earlier. Excluding merger and restructuring charges, earnings were $1.21 per share, topping the analysts' forecast by 3 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue on a taxable equivalent basis rose 31 percent to $8.59 billion. Analysts on average expected revenue of $7.91 billion. Noninterest expense rose 18 percent to $4.93 billion. The results were the first to include Golden West, a mortgage lending specialist and 285-branch thrift that Wachovia acquired on October 1 for $24.2 billion, amid criticism that it overpaid just as the U.S housing market was cresting. Wachovia shares closed Monday at $56.27 on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock had risen 9 percent in the last year, compared with a 15 percent gain in the Philadelphia KBW Bank Index .BKX. LOAN, DEPOSIT GROWTH Consumer and business banking profit surged 73 percent to $1.67 billion, helped by increased loans and deposits primarily from Golden West and Westcorp Inc., a California auto lender that Wachovia bought last March. Net interest margin, the difference between what the bank earns on loans and pays on deposits, rose to 3.09 percent from the third quarter's 3.03 percent, and fell from 3.25 percent a year earlier. Corporate and investment banking profit rose 27 percent to $531 million, helped by record merger advising and securities underwriting, and strength in real estate capital markets. Earnings rose 42 percent in capital management and 29 percent in wealth management. Credit losses rose, largely because of Golden West. Wachovia more than doubled what it set aside for bad loans to $206 million, and net chargeoffs more than doubled to $140 million. Nonperforming assets rose 90 percent to $1.37 billion. Net loans rose 63 percent to $416.8 billion, deposits rose 25 percent to $407.5 billion, and assets rose 36 percent to $707.1 billion.
