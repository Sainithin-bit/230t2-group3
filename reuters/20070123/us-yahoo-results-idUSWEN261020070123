 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Yahoo Inc. ( YHOO.O ) said on Tuesday quarterly profit dropped 61 percent, weighed down by options expenses, but investors rallied around its announcement of an early debut for its Internet advertising system. 

 Shares in the Internet media company rose more than 5 percent to $28.40 in extended trading from its Nasdaq close at $26.96, after its management said it was rolling out the new system for selling Web search advertising, dubbed Panama. The comments helped overcome investor concerns over the company's conservative first-quarter and full-year forecasts. "We have successfully transitioned the large majority of our revenue to the new search system known as Project Panama," Chief Executive Terry Semel said on a conference call with analysts. "We believe this will deliver more relevant text ads to users, which in turn should create greater volume of high-quality leads." Yahoo will introduce its new system for ranking Web ads in the United States as of February 5, about a month earlier than expected by Wall Street analysts, and it was on track to bring it to international clients in the second quarter. Wall Street has been waiting for signs of Panama's progress, as its introduction is a key strategy for Yahoo to compete with much-faster-growing rival Google Inc ( GOOG.O ). "The guidance was a bit more conservative than many were hoping," said Jordan Rohan, analyst with RBC Capital Markets, before company comments on a conference call. "It's conservative because there are many unknowns. How do you really know how and when Panama comes through?" Yahoo's net income for the fourth quarter fell to $269 million, or 19 cents per share, compared with the year-earlier quarter's $683 million, or 46 cents per share. Adjusted net income for the fourth quarter of 2005, including stock-based compensation, was $247 million, or 16 cents per share. Gross revenue for the latest quarter rose 13 percent to $1.70 billion. Excluding traffic acquisition costs (TAC) -- the cut of revenue Yahoo pays to marketing partners who run ads on its systems -- net revenue grew 15 percent to $1.23 billion. Excluding one-time items, Yahoo reported earnings per share of 16 cents. The profit was well ahead of forecasts from Wall Street analysts, who were looking for 13 cents per share before items, according to a survey by Reuters Estimates. Both figures include stock-based compensation. Analysts were looking for fourth-quarter revenue, on average, of $1.22 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. Yahoo's biggest revenue contributor, the online brand advertising it provides to corporate marketers, is also facing price pressure from a shift in consumer interest to social networking sites such as MySpace, Facebook and YouTube. Yahoo said it expected first-quarter net revenue, excluding TAC, of $1.12 billion to $1.23 billion. Analysts had forecast revenue of $1.18 billion to $1.38 billion. For the full year, the Sunnyvale, California-based company said it expected revenue, excluding TAC, of $4.95 billion to $5.45 billion. Analysts were looking for 2007 revenue in a range of $5.20 billion to $5.92 billion. (Additional reporting by  Michele Gershberg  and  Daisuke Wakabayashi )
