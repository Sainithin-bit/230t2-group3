 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Chemical maker DuPont Co. on Tuesday posted higher fourth-quarter earnings, but U.S. sales declined because of the weak housing and auto markets. 

 DuPont, whose shares fell nearly 3 percent, had warned in November of the softness in the United States. Sales volumes there fell 5 percent for the quarter. "Those headwinds turned out to be stronger than we expected late in the quarter, as customers reduced their inventory levels adjusting to decline in housing starts," Chief Financial Officer Jeffrey Keefer told a conference call. Net income rose to $871 million, or 94 cents a share, from $154 million, or 16 cents a share, a year earlier. The latest results included $449 million from tax settlements and insurance recoveries. Excluding special items, earnings increased to 45 cents per share from 13 cents, matching the average forecast from analysts polled by Reuters Estimates. Global net sales climbed 8 percent to $6.3 billion. About half that increase was due to higher prices and currency effects, the company said. Volume was up 4 percent worldwide. DuPont, like other large chemical companies, has suffered because of higher raw materials costs, particularly natural gas, but the Wilmington, Delaware-based company has moved to insulate itself by focusing on higher-margin specialty chemicals. "Earnings were good, and we look forward to margins benefiting in 2007 from lower raw material costs," said Jim Russell, director of core equity strategy at Fifth Third Asset Management, where he helps invest $22 billion. DuPont, whose products range from Kevlar suits to hybrid seeds, stood by its 2007 forecast for earnings per share of about $3.15, up from $2.88 in 2006, with growth outside the United States expected to top U.S. increases. Costs are likely to be steady with 2006. The company said it aimed to save more than $400 million in 2007 from productivity improvements designed to offset inflation. SEEDS OF GROWTH DuPont has begun shifting investments to growth areas, notably the seed business, where competitor Monsanto ( MON.N ) has widened its market-leading position in the high-margin genetically-modified segment in recent years. DuPont has cut spending at its crop protection and nutrition business to focus on seeds, and made some headway in regaining market share in the seed business in the Southern Hemisphere in the fourth quarter, said HSBC analyst Hassan Ahmed. "They've lost so much over the last five years it should be relatively easy for them to regain some of that" in 2007, he said. The Agriculture and Nutrition business, which includes the Pioneer seed business, saw sales rise 17 percent to $1.1 billion. However, it posted a loss of $350 million, compared with a year-earlier loss of $272 million, because of seasonal weakness and costs from restructuring. The Coatings and Color Technologies unit posted an operating profit of $282 million, up from $153 million a year earlier, when it suffered from the impact of Hurricane Katrina. Coatings also saw a 31 percent jump in the sales of the pigment titanium dioxide and a gain on the sale of assets. DuPont shares were down $1.36, or 2.7 percent, at $48.74 in morning New York Stock Exchange trade, up from an early low at $48.34 and underperforming the Standard & Poor's Chemicals Index .GSPPM, which was off 0.2 percent.
