 BOSTON  (Reuters) - United Technologies Corp. ( UTX.N ) reported profit on Tuesday that topped Wall Street's expectations, boosted by strong demand from the aerospace and commercial construction sectors. 

 The diversified manufacturer, which makes products ranging from Pratt & Whitney jet engines to Otis elevators, reported fourth-quarter profit of $865 million, or 87 cents per share, compared with net income of $626 million, or 62 cents per share, a year earlier. Analysts, on average, expected profit of 85 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Net income was up 38.2 percent. Factoring out the effects of an accounting change, the company said it was up 20 percent. "The numbers looked great, and the company is making progress on the top line," said Jim Russell, director of core equity strategy at Fifth Third Asset Management, a Cincinnati-based company that manages about $20 billion in assets and holds United Technologies shares. Revenue came in at $12.79 billion, up 13.6 percent from $11.26 billion a year earlier. Analysts had expected $12.19 billion. "The stronger-than-expected revenue figures drive the better-than-expected quarterly results," wrote UBS analyst David Bleustein in a research note. AFFIRMS 2007 OUTLOOK "We believe we are well positioned for earnings increases in 2007, and especially on favorable compares at Carrier and Sikorsky," Chairman and Chief Executive George David said in a  statement. He confirmed the company's 2007 profit target of $4.05 to $4.20 per share. While aviation has boosted the Hartford, Connecticut-based company, United Technologies said results at its Carrier air conditioner unit were hurt by a slowing U.S. housing market while Sikorsky, its helicopter operation, faced some operational problems. The fastest profit growth came at the company's Hamilton Sundstrand airplane electronics unit, where profit was up 25.9 percent, followed by Otis, where it rose 20.7 percent. Sikorsky was the one unit to see profit decline, by 17.1 percent. Company officials said they expect performance at Sikorsky and Carrier to improve through the year. United Technologies shares rose $1.87, or 2.9 percent, to $65.96, on the New York Stock Exchange. Earlier, they'd been as high as $66.41. That put them up 5.5 percent for the year, while the blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI , of which United Technologies is a component, was up 0.3 percent. In 2006, the company bought back $2.07 billion in shares, saying it was spending less than its usual target of $2 billion on acquisitions in the face of rising valuations. Last month, the United Technologies board approved a plan to buy back about $4 billion in shares. "Acquisitions happen when they happen," said Greg Hayes, vice president of accounting and control, on a conference call with analysts. "For 2007 we will again hold a $2 billion placeholder for acquisitions." (Additional reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York)
