 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - A key forecasting gauge for the U.S. economy rose by a larger-than-expected 0.3 percent in December, the private Conference Board research firm said on Tuesday, suggesting moderate growth in the months ahead. 

 The rise in the Composite Index of Leading Economic Indicators topped expectations for a 0.2 percent rise in December, the report by the New York-based Conference Board showed. "The latest data for the Leading Economic Index is pointing to a continued moderate growth or even a little acceleration, said the Conference Board's labor economist Ken Goldstein, The November index, which originally was reported to have risen 0.1 percent, was revised to show no change. The October reading was revised to show a 0.1 percent fall rather than a 0.1 percent gain. "The combination of income growth and lower energy prices might spark a little more economic activity this spring, unless offset by some new development," Goldstein said in a statement. The leading index, which measures a basket of economic indicators ranging from unemployment insurance claims to building permits, is designed to forecast economic trends up to six months ahead. Six of the 10 indicators that make up the leading index increased in December with largest gain in building permits, the Conference Board said. The largest negative contributors were interest rate spreads and consumer expectations.
