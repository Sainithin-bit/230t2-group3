 LONDON  (Reuters) - U.S. media company Walt Disney Co. ( DIS.N ) is not interested in buying Telefonica's 75 percent stake in TV producer Endemol EML.AS, a source close to the company said on Tuesday. 

 "We are not interested in it," said the source. Disney was touted on Monday as possibly being interested with Endemol co-founder John de Mol in forming an alliance to repurchase the Dutch production house. Telefonica ( TEF.MC ) expects to sell its Endemol stake in the first quarter this year. Shares in Endemol jumped as much as 12 percent on Tuesday following a Spanish newspaper report that Rupert Murdoch, who controls News Corp. NWSa.N NWS.N, was interested in buying Telefonica's stake.
