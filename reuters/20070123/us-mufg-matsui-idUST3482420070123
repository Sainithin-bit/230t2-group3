 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Mitsubishi UFJ Securities Co. Ltd. 8615.T, the brokerage arm of Japan's biggest banking group, and online broker Matsui Securities Co. Ltd. ( 8628.T ) are discussing capital and operational ties, company and financial sources said on Tuesday. 

 The Mitsubishi UFJ group is seeking a 15 percent stake in Matsui, the Yomiuri newspaper reported. At Matsui's current market price, that would put the value of the deal at 44.2 billion yen ($363.3 million). The Mitsubishi UFJ group already owns a 30 percent stake in Matsui rival Kabu.com Securities Co. Ltd. ( 8703.T ), a smaller Internet broker with a roughly 6 percent share of Japan's online trading market compared with Matsui's 13 percent. Adding Matsui as a second online affiliate would give the group broader market access and allow it to tap Matsui's older, wealthier client base. The Yomiuri said group holding company Mitsubishi UFJ Financial (MUFG) ( 8306.T ) is in the final stage of talks with Matsui. MUFG is also thinking of raising its holding in Kabu.com ( 8703.T ) to around 40 percent, the newspaper said. An agreement between MUFG and Matsui could come this month, the Yomiuri said, adding that MUFG hopes to have Matsui sell securities underwritten by Mitsubishi UFJ Securities to its retail customers. Matsui Securities, MUFG and Kabu.com all said in statements that nothing has yet been decided. Reuters' sources said the stake in Matsui would likely be bought directly by Mitsubishi UFJ Securities. They added that Mitsubishi UFJ and Matsui were still discussing the size of the holding. Matsui's shares fell 1.0 percent on Tuesday morning, compared with a 1.2 percent decline in the brokerage sector sub-index .ISECU.T. MUFG was down 1.29 percent, while the benchmark Nikkei  .N225  fell 0.48 percent. On January 10, MUFG rival Mizuho Financial Group ( 8411.T ) said it would combine two of its group brokerages to create Japan's third-biggest securities house by revenue. Mizuho's new brokerage would overtake Mitsubishi UFJ Securities, currently the country's fourth-ranked broker, and be the largest securities house directly controlled by a Japanese bank.
