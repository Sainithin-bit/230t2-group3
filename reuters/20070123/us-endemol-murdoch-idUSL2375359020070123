 LONDON/AMSTERDAM  (Reuters) - Shares in Endemol, EML.AS jumped 12 percent briefly on Tuesday after a Spanish newspaper report said media tycoon Rupert Murdoch was keen to buy Telefonica's ( TEF.MC ) 75 percent stake in the Dutch company that produces the controversial "Big Brother" reality TV show. 

 Murdoch's name was touted on Tuesday by Spanish newspaper La Gaceta a day after it ran a story saying U.S. giant Disney ( DIS.N ) had formed an alliance with Dutch media mogul John de Mol, who founded Endemol, to buy Telefonica's stake. However, a source close to Disney told Reuters on Tuesday that the global entertainment conglomerate was not involved. "We are not interested in it," said the source, referring to Telefonica's stake, which is expected to be sold within months. Speculation about a possible buyer has focused on media players with a global reach who could inject Endemol's television content into their own channels. Amsterdam-based Kempen analyst Oskar Tijs said it made sense for any big media conglomerate to look at Endemol. "They are market leader. They have a proven track record in building valuable formats, top formats. There is rationale to look at this deal," he said. Endemol-related bid speculation coincides with widespread criticism over Endemol's "Celebrity Big Brother" show, which has been at the center of a row in Britain and India over alleged racism and bullying by contestants on the show. CONTENT FOR CHANNELS "Big Brother" has served Endemol well in recent years via its formats around the world and contributes about 20 percent of the company's 900 million euro ($1.17 billion) annual revenue. JP Morgan analyst Mark O'Donnell, who follows Endemol, said he was not surprised to see Murdoch and Disney's name in the frame, given they own the Fox and ABC networks, respectively. "It is kind of a natural assumption that if you believed Disney was interested and going to scoop up "Deal or No Deal", "Big Brother", "Extreme Makeover", "Home Addition" and "Fear Factor" -- all very successful formats in the U.S. -- and put them on ABC, that you would have interest from your competitors," O'Donnell said. By 0955 GMT, Endemol shares were up 2.1 percent at 20.75 euros after hitting a fresh year high at 22.74 euros earlier. The shares have more than doubled in price since Endemol's November 2005 listing on the Amsterdam stock exchange. Kempen's Tijs said just months ago a buyer was not expected to pay more than 15 euros per share. Spain's La Gaceta said Murdoch, who controls News Corp. NWSa.N NWS.N, would buy the Telefonica stake alone, giving no further details and citing no sources. Telefonica declined comment. De Mol, who founded Endemol with producer Joop van den Ende in 1994 and sold it to Telefonica in 2000, said in September that he had been approached by Italy's Mediaset ( MS.MI ) to form a consortium to buy a stake in Endemol. A spokesman for De Mol, who has a 5.15 percent stake in Endemol, has declined to comment on the stake bid speculation. Spanish media group Vocento, Sony Entertainment ( 6758.T ) and Time Warner ( TWX.N ) were also named last year as being interested in Endemol. Endemol's Chief Financial Officer Jan Peter Kerstens told Reuters in September that the company would prefer not to be owned by a broadcaster so as not to strain relations with existing clients.
