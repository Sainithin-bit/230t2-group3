 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Sun Microsystems Inc.SUNW.O on Tuesday posted a quarterly profit versus a year-ago loss as revenue rose 7 percent, fueled by higher sales of its computer servers. 

 Sun also said it entered into a $700 million private placement deal with KKR Private Equity Investors KKR.AS, the public fund of private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. COMMENTARY: MARTIN REYNOLDS, MANAGING VICE PRESIDENT, GARTNER "What I see here that is encouraging is 14 percent year-over-year growth in their computer systems, which is decent, good, strong. "There was a time Sun was really struggling...was losing customers faster than they were gaining them. We see this (quarter) as very encouraging. We are just coming out of ...the last quarter they get to count against a relatively weak quarter, so we'll watch the next quarter with some interest." BRENT BRACELIN, ANALYST, PACIFIC CREST SECURITIES "The KKR investments are interesting, but it's unclear what it plans to do with the money. It's causing all sorts of speculation out there." "The company had a very good quarter with the return to profitability. Clearly there is momentum with the new product upgrades."
