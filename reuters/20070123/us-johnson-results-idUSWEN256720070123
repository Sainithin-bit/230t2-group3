 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson ( JNJ.N ) said on Tuesday fourth quarter profit rose, helped by favorable taxes and growing sales of drugs and consumer products, although stent sales fell sharply. 

 "We view this quarter as a relative non-event," Morgan Stanley analyst Glenn Reicin said in a research note, citing no major surprises in the results. J&J, whose earnings growth in recent years has been far steadier than its rivals due to the company's diversification, is girding for patent expirations in 2008 and 2009 on its Risperdal schizophrenia drug and Topamax epilepsy medicine. It earned $2.17 billion, or 74 cents per share in the fourth quarter, compared with $2.1 billion, or 70 cents, a year earlier. The results included $217 million in charges related to acquisition of Pfizer Inc.'s ( PFE.N ) consumer health unit, which gave J&J such brands as Listerine mouthwash and the Sudafed allergy drug. Excluding special items, J&J earned 81 cents per share, beating by two cents per share the average forecast of analysts polled by Reuters Estimates. The company's strong showing was largely due to lower than expected taxes, Bank of America analyst Glenn Novarro said. "J&J's fourth-quarter results reflect the broad-based nature of the company's portfolio, with international pharmaceutical and consumer sales offsetting weaker U.S. medical device sales," he said. J&J, whose shares fell 1 percent, said sales rose 8.5 percent to $13.7 billion, matching the Reuters Estimates forecast. Consumer product revenue -- including the New Brunswick, New Jersey-based company's Aveeno skin products, jumped 11.2 percent to $2.57 billion. Global pharmaceutical sales rose 8.5 percent to $5.95 billion, helped by strong demand for Risperdal and Topamax. Sales of medical devices and diagnostics rose 7.2 percent to $5.17 billion, although global sales of the company's drug-coated Cypher stent fell 15 percent to $580 million. J&J officials told analysts in a conference call they expect 2007 earnings of between $4.05 and 4.10 per share, excluding the impact of the Pfizer consumer deal. Analysts polled by Reuters Estimates, on average, were expecting $3.98. The company earned $3.73 per share in 2006. Fourth-quarter sales of Risperdal rose 18 percent to $1.06 billion, despite strong competition with Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.'s ( BMY.N ) newer Abilify. Sales of Topamax jumped 28 percent to $529 million. Sales of arthritis drug Remicade grew 13 percent to $780 million, while those of attention deficit disorder treatment Concerta rose 24 percent to $257 million. But combined sales of anemia drugs Procrit and Eprex slipped 1 percent to $788 million, hurt by longer-acting rival Aranesp sold by Amgen Inc. ( AMGN.O ). U.S. sales of Cypher, used to prop open coronary arteries that have been cleared of plaque, fell 18 percent to $280 million, hurt by overall softness in demand for the devices. Sales of drug-coated stents have been hurt by reports showing they can cause blood clots long after they have been implanted. Shares of J&J were down 70 cents to $66.48 in midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange. (Additional reporting by  Julie Steenhuysen  in Chicago)
