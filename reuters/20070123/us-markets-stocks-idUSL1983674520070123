 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. stocks gained on Tuesday as a spike in crude oil prices lifted shares of energy companies, including Exxon Mobil Corp.( XOM.N ), while strong profits from United Technologies Corp. ( UTX.N ) gave investors a reason to buy aerospace stocks. 

 Crude oil futures prices surged near the end of trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange after U.S. Energy Secretary Sam Bodman said the government planned to fill the nation's Strategic Petroleum Reserve. U.S. crude for March delivery CLc1 jumped $2.46, or 4.7 percent, to settle at $55.04 a barrel. United Technologies' quarterly profit topped Wall Street's expectations, driven by demand from the aerospace and commercial construction sectors. The stock, up 3.2 percent, or $2.05 at $66.14, contributed the most to the Dow's advance.  "The aerospace sector is definitely strong and you're seeing good spending," said Benjamin Halliburton, managing director at Tradition Capital Management in Summit, New Jersey. "We're also seeing a little bounce on the energy stocks as they got down to really low valuations." The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  gained 56.64 points, or 0.45 percent, to end at 12,533.80. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  added 5.04 points, or 0.35 percent, to finish at 1,427.99. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  inched up just 0.34 of a point, or 0.01 percent, to 2,431.41. YAHOO JUMPS LATE, BUT AMD DROPS After the closing bell, shares of Yahoo Inc. ( YHOO.O ) rose 4.7 percent to $28.22 from a Nasdaq close at $26.96 after the company said it will launch a new search ad system a month early, despite posting a drop in its quarterly net profit.  Shares of Advanced Micro Devices ( AMD.N ) fell 5.4 percent to $16.57, off its close at $17.51 on the New York Stock Exchange, after the chip maker posted a quarterly loss. OIL AND DEFENSE STOCKS DANCE During the regular session, Exxon's stock gained 2.2 percent, or $1.59, to $74.49 on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock was the top positive influence on the S&P 500 and among the Dow's biggest gainers. Aerospace stocks rose, led by United Technologies and Boeing ( BA.N ). Shares of Boeing, the big U.S. aircraft maker and the No. 2 U.S. defense contractor, climbed 2.1 percent, or $1.76, to $87.36, recovering partially from a sharp fall in the previous session. The Dow Jones U.S. Aerospace Index .DJUSAS was up 2.7 percent. The integrated oil and gas sector was the S&P 500's best-performing sector. Shares of Schlumberger Ltd. ( SLB.N ) gained 4.3 percent, or $2.62, to $63.62, while Chevron ( CVX.N ) rose 1.9 percent, or $1.34, to $72.56 and ConocoPhillips ( COP.N ) added 2.5 percent, or $1.59, to $64.97. In addition to Exxon Mobil, these companies' stocks were the S&P 500's biggest advancers. The White House said President Bush will call for a doubling of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve's capacity in his State of the Union speech on Tuesday evening. Bush is also expected to urge Congress to reduce American gasoline usage by boosting production of alternative fuels. <ID:nN23191849> Shares of Pacific Ethanol Inc. ( PEIX.O ) shot up 6.1 percent, or $1.03, to $17.85 on the Nasdaq. TEXAS INSTRUMENTS CLIMBS Tech stocks ended the regular session nearly flat, as investors were cautious about earnings reports from many big-name technology companies, such as Microsoft Corp. ( MSFT.O ) and Qualcomm Inc. ( QCOM.O ), due later in the week. Investors had been disappointed last week by reports from Intel Corp. ( INTC.O ) and Apple Inc. ( AAPL.O ). Shares of cellphone chip maker Texas Instruments Inc. TXN.N gained 3.5 percent, or $1.01, to $29.60 after it posted a quarterly profit that topped estimates and said it would cut about 500 jobs. <ID:nN22174163> The stock was among the S&P 500's biggest gainers, along with United Technologies and several energy stocks. "The tech sector has been beaten down the most by negative comments, so the information coming out of Texas Instruments today was at least welcomed," said Paul Nolte, director of investments at Hinsdale Associates in Hinsdale, Illinois. Trading was active on the New York Stock Exchange, where about 1.67 billion shares were traded, below the 1.84 billion daily average for last year. On the Nasdaq, about 2.11 billion shares were traded, above the 2.02 billion daily average from last year. Advancing shares beat declining shares by a ratio of about 2 to 1 on the NYSE and on Nasdaq, by about 3 to 2.
