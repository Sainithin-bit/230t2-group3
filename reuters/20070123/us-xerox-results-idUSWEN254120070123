 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Xerox Corp. ( XRX.N ), the world's largest provider of office printers, copiers and related services, posted better-than-expected quarterly profit on Tuesday, boosted by sales of its digital color systems and supplies. 

 Excluding restructuring costs related to job cuts and plant closings, fourth-quarter profit was 38 cents a share, a penny better than the average forecast of analysts polled by Reuters Estimates. The company, whose growth is driven by high-end printing and document-management services, said net income fell to $214 million, or 22 cents a share, from $282 million, or 27 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue totaled $4.38 billion, a 3 percent increase, all of which was the result of a weaker dollar. Equipment sales fell 1 percent, but post-sale revenue -- or sales of supplies and services -- rose 5 percent. Revenue from color products rose 13 percent. "Beyond currency, it was a very strong quarter from an operational standpoint," said Cross Research analyst Shannon Cross. "Their installs were solid in the areas where they want to focus, so its going to lead to a stronger installed base, which is what you want in a razor-razor blade model," she said referring to the company's losses on equipment sales, but profits on the services related to that equipment. Xerox said gross margins were 41.1 percent, about flat from fourth quarter of 2005. Over the past three years, Xerox has grabbed market share with new digital printers and office systems, but it still struggles to boost equipment sales. However, it expects that over time its digital equipment sales, and related supplies and services, will yield higher profit margins. The Stamford, Connecticut, company says sales of color printers yield five times the revenue of black-and-white systems, fueled by service contracts and supplies like paper and replacement ink and toner. Looking ahead, Xerox said it sees first quarter earnings in a range of 21 cents a share to 23 cents a share. Analysts were expecting a profit of 22 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Xerox shares, which have risen 15 percent in the past 12 months, closed at $16.70 on the New York Stock Exchange on Monday.
