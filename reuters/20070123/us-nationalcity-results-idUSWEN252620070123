 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - National City Corp. NCC.N, the No. 8 U.S. bank, said on Tuesday that fourth-quarter profit rose, helped by a big gain from the sale of its subprime lending unit. 

 Net income for the Cleveland-based company rose to $842 million, or $1.36 per share, from $398 million, or 64 cents a share, a year earlier.
