 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Texas Instruments Inc. posted a better-than-expected quarterly profit due to a tax credit, but its first-quarter forecast fell short of analyst forecasts as the No. 1 cellphone chipmaker citing growth skewed toward low-priced phones and declining inventories across the board. 

 But TI shares rose 2 percent in after-hours trading on Monday on investor hopes that the worst of the company's weakness would be over after the first quarter, analysts said. It forecast first-quarter earnings per share of 28 cents to 34 cents on revenue of $2.95 billion to $3.2 billion. It expects to take restructuring charges of about $55 million, about evenly distributed in 2007. On average, analysts had expected first-quarter earnings of 35 cents a share on revenue of $3.3 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. "The outlook is very weak, actually. The decline in revenue is about 9 percent, which is much more than normal seasonality," Cody Acree, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus, said. He said TI's shares were up as investors hoped this was the bottom. "It's a psychology that says this must be all the bad news so therefore you're free to buy it and you've got to buy before everybody else buys it," said Acree. "This may well be the worst guidance and things may improve from here on out, but that's debatable," Acree said. TI said inventory levels, which fell in the fourth quarter because TI had overcome earlier production constraints, would continue to fall through the middle of the first quarter but would start to grow again in the second half of the quarter. "We don't have customers pointing to sharp fallouts to demand. Generally demand seems to be healthy and relatively stable," investor relations vice president Ron Slaymaker told analysts on a conference call. TI, which makes chips for everything from calculators to the latest high-tech televisions, said fourth-quarter profit rose to $668 million, or 45 cents a share, compared with $655 million, or 40 cents a share, in the year-ago quarter. The increase was bolstered by a 5 cent per share federal research tax credit and a 1 cent gain from new patent license agreements that replaced previously expired pacts. Revenue rose to $3.46 billion from $3.32 billion. Excluding some special items, TI's profit came to 39 cents per share, slightly ahead of average analysts' forecast of 38 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. "Demand in the fourth quarter of the year was unseasonably weak, and we limited production to reduce our inventories," TI Chief Executive Rich Templeton said in a statement. Chief Financial Officer Kevin March said TI would start to ramp up production again in the current quarter to prepare for when demand returns to normal but he said the company could not say whether that would be in the second or third quarter. In December, TI cut its forecast for earnings per share from continuing operations to a range of 37 cents to 40 cents, and cut its revenue target to a range of $3.35 billion to $3.50 billion, citing weak demand. The company also said it would revamp its development of advanced digital process technology, cutting about 500 jobs and coordinating more closely with its foundry partners to reduce annualized expenses by about $200 million. Its shares had fallen almost 16 percent in the last four months on concern that wireless industry growth is increasingly dependent on the sale of cheaper phones in emerging markets. TI rose as high as $29.31 in after-market trading from its close of $28.59 on the New York Stock Exchange. (Additional reporting by  Scott Hillis  and  Michele Gershberg )
