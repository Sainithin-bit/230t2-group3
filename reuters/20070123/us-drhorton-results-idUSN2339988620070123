 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - D.R. Horton Inc. ( DHI.N ) the largest U.S. home builder, said on Tuesday its profit fell sharply, due in part to lower land values, but the results beat the average Wall Street forecast sending its shares to their highest level since May. 

 The Fort Worth, Texas-based builder said earnings for its fiscal first quarter ended December 31 fell 65 percent to $109.7 million, or 35 cents per share but beat analysts average forecast of 33 cents per share. Horton shares were up $2.07, or 7.6 percent, to $29.20 on the New York Stock Exchange in afternoon trading after going as high as $29.38. Home builders as a group were up 4.1 percent according to the Dow Jones U.S. Home Construction Index .DJUSHB. "There's the feeling that maybe the worst is behind us, that the housing market is weak but you're not seeing a real calamity in the results of these companies," BB&T Capital Markets analyst said Jack Kasprzak. Still, the downturn in the U.S. housing market continued to take its toll on high-end Florida condominium builder WCI Communities Inc.WCI.N, which warned its fourth-quarter results would be lower than expected because of higher-than-anticipated cancellations. Horton's results included charges totaling $77.7 million, or 15 cents per share, for land options forfeited and for the lower value of inventory of homes built and not yet sold. Home builders have been able to absorb large charges for land value write-downs without jeopardizing their balance sheets, Kasprzak added. Additionally, prior to Horton's quarterly report, Goldman Sachs upgraded its shares to a "buy" from a "neutral," and upgraded the sector to a "neutral," saying the sharp decline in the housing market may be slowing. During the quarter, Horton closed on the sale of 10,202 homes, more than the 9,891 a year earlier. But home-building revenue stayed the same, at $2.8 billion, as gross margins deteriorated 9.2 percentage points to 18.6 percent. Earlier in January, Horton said orders during the quarter fell 23.5 percent to 8,771 homes, with the  most severe drop in the Northeast. The value of the homes on order declined even more, down 28 percent to $2.3 billion, as the company used incentives to lure buyers. Would-be buyers canceled orders at a rate of 33 percent, down from 40 percent the prior quarter but still higher than its normal range of 16 percent to 20 percent. Horton has been downshifting its operations to better conform with the fall-off of the U.S. housing market. Since a peak in March 2006, the company has slashed the number of lots it controls by 25 percent to 297,000 and has cut the number of homes under construction by 35 percent to 26,000 from a June 2006 peak of 40,000. The company did not issue a forecast for results for the year. But Chief Executive Donald Tomnitz reiterated that he expected the market to bottom out by midyear and remain at floor level until next year. "Right now we don't see anything on the horizon that would change that opinion," he said during a conference call with analysts. "We expect the market to remain relatively flat to slightly up commencing in 2008, and that's just our feeling at this point in time."
