 PARIS  (Reuters) - Franco-American telecoms equipment provider Alcatel-Lucent <ALU. PA> lost over a tenth of its market value on Tuesday after it warned that uncertainty created by its recent merger would hurt sales and profits. 

 The warning is a setback for Chief Executive Patricia Russo who took charge on December1, the first day the two companies started operating as a combined unit which is the world's second-largest supplier of telecom network and mobile equipment behind rival Cisco Systems Inc. ( CSCO.O ). Russo said the complex transatlantic merger combined with the acquisition of Nortel's UMTS radio business and the transfer of some of Alcatel's business to Thales ( TCFP.PA ) - all completed in the past few weeks - had affected trading. "In the past few months, these moves created short-term uncertainty for our customers and for our people as we worked to develop the combined company's product portfolio and new organization structure," Russo said in a statement. "This uncertainty together with the work required to close the merger significantly impacted the business," she added. Alcatel-Lucent shares fell as much as 12.3 percent to an intraday low of 9.60 euros, dragging the sector lower. The stock was down 10.7 percent at 9.78 euros in early afternoon trade. The DJ Stoxx European technology sector .SX8P was down 1.75 percent. Ericsson ( ERICb.ST ) at one stage fell over 1 percent. "Once again, their recovery has been put back. It's a bit tiring," said Banque Martin Maurel fund manager Michel Dumoulin, pointing out it had disappointed analysts in the third quarter. He said he would hold onto his Alcatel-Lucent shares for now. The company said on an adjusted pro-forma basis, it expected fourth-quarter 2006 revenue of around 4.42 billion euros, down from 5.25 billion in the same 2005 quarter. The average forecast in a Reuters survey of seven analysts was 4.75 billion euros. Alcatel-Lucent said it expected unadjusted fourth-quarter revenues of about 3.87 billion euros ($5 billion) and a fourth-quarter operating income of about 120 million euros. On an adjusted pro-forma basis, the fourth-quarter operating profit is expected to be approximately breakeven, compared with 570 million euro profit for the 2005 fourth quarter and an average forecast for 539 million euros. Alcatel-Lucent added it expected asset impairment charges of around 800 million euros for the fourth quarter. DOUBTERS PROVED RIGHT? For some investors, doubts still linger over last year's transatlantic merger which aimed to enhance the competitive advantage of the two companies through economies of scale. "Given the chequered past of both Lucent and Alcatel, which both have had their specific problems, it was tough to be optimistic about the merger," said ABN AMRO Asset Management's Theo Maas, who helps oversee over 30 billion euros in assets. Investment bank Dresdner Kleinwort kept a "sell" rating on the shares and doubted the company could hold market share. But Christine de Froment, who heads Paris investment house Marignan Gestion, said the merger could still work. "Mergers make sense in this sector, and today's share price fall could represent a buying opportunity," said Froment, whose company holds Alcatel-Lucent shares. Besides merger worries, Alcatel-Lucent blamed the sales and profit shortfall on a shift in spending by its large North American customers and intense competition in wireless communications networks. Sprint ( S.N ) for instance is investing close to $3 billion in a new wireless broadband Internet network for which it has contracted Lucent rivals. Russo said Alcatel-Lucent expected to resume growth in 2007, although from a lower base of around 18.3 billion euros of 2006 revenues, down from 18.6 billion euros in 2005 and analysts' average forecast of 19.5 billion euros. The company said its target cost savings of at least 600 million euros for the full year 2007 are 200 million euros higher than initially announced.
