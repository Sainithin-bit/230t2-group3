 SEOUL  (Reuters) - South Korea's LG Electronics Inc. ( 066570.KS ) posted a surprise fourth-quarter operating loss on Tuesday, as its flat-screen operations struggled amid fierce competition, and said its short-term outlook remained difficult. 

 Analysts are bearish about the current quarter as weak seasonal demand will further hurt the display unit, but further ahead prospects brighten somewhat as the recently-launched Chocolate and Shine models drive handset sales growth. "We don't expect clear improvements from the plasma display panel business in the first quarter," Jeong Ho-young, LG's chief financial officer, told an investor briefing. An all-out battle between liquid crystal display (LCD) and plasma display panels (PDP) for the flat screen television and computer screen markets has tilted to the LCD makers' advantage. Chang In-whan, chief executive and fund manager at KTB Asset Management, said LG may also struggle to improve its handset business amid cutthroat competition with global players. LG, which competes with local rival Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd. ( 005930.KS ), posted a 43.4 billion won ($46.1 million) operating loss for October-December, swinging from a 211.1 billion profit a year earlier. Analysts had forecast operating profit of around 100 billion won. At a net profit level, LG earned 48.2 billion won, helped by non-operating items including contributions from overseas affiliates. The result was still down sharply from 312.2 billion a year ago, although above expectations for 22.6 billion won. With LCD players slashing prices and overwhelming the popular 40-inch size category, PDP makers such as LG have had to drastically lower prices and downgrade their 2007 expectations. LG continued to feel the negative impact of another poor quarter at LG.Philips LCD ( 034220.KS ), its 38 percent-owned LCD joint venture with Philips Electronics ( PHG.AS ), which last week reported a 174 billion won fourth-quarter net loss, its third quarterly loss in a row, and forecast another difficult year. LG also blamed a stronger won currency, which gained 8.4 percent against the dollar last year. Exports accounted for three quarters of LG's revenue in the fourth quarter. Shares in LG, valued at around $8 billion, closed down 0.9 percent, trailing the broader market's  .KS11  0.02 percent dip. LG lost 9.8 percent in the fourth quarter, compared with the wider market's 4.6 percent rise. HANDSET MARGINS Last month, LG replaced its chief executive, chief financial officer and several business unit leaders in an attempt to restore momentum to its stalled handset and display business. Full-year 2007 net profit is expected to jump to 651.5 billion won from 211.9 billion won last year, according to Reuters Estimates. Margins at LG's display division, which makes PDP screens, computer monitors and TV sets, were negative 12.2 percent in the fourth quarter, worsening from positive 2.5 percent in the third quarter. The performance cost the unit 147 billion won in the fourth quarter. LG, the world's fifth-biggest mobile phone maker after Nokia ( NOK1V.HE ), Motorola Inc. MOT.N, Samsung and Sony-Ericsson ( 6758.T ) ( ERICb.ST ), sold 17 million handsets, up from 16.5 million in the third quarter. It aims to sell 78 million units in 2007, up about 20 percent from 2006. Handset margins, however, fell to 2.7 percent from 3.7 percent in the third quarter, as the company admitted it had to cut prices on some key products. "Competition in the handset business is getting very tough, and LG is having a hard time," said Lim Chang-gue, fund manager at Samsung Investment Trust Management. "They've lost a lot of market share and it won't be easy for them to recover it even by putting out new slim phones or other high-end phones." LG also addressed growing speculation that Philips will soon sell its 32.9 percent stake in LG.Philips. "We plan to propose that Philips look for a strategic buyer for its stake," Park Seong-ho, LG's vice president of investor relations, said at the investor meeting, adding that a strategic buyer would be the best solution for LG.Philips. Philips has said it would sell the stake, but analysts think it could go to financial investors as strategic partners may be hard to find.
