 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. NWSa.N 
has joined the Chandler family in its bid to buy newspaper and 
television station owner Tribune Co. TRB.N, a source familiar 
with the matter said on Tuesday. 

  The source said its participation is considered small and 
Murdoch chiefly aims to cut printing and back-office costs at 
the money-losing New York Post newspaper.  News Corp. is restricted from buying Tribune's Newsday as 
U.S. media ownership laws prevents the company from owning 
another U.S. newspaper in the same region.  Tribune, which owns the Los Angeles Times newspaper and the 
Chicago Cubs baseball team, is in the process of reviewing 
offers.
