 AMSTERDAM  (Reuters) - Dutch specialist market maker Van der Moolen Holding VDMN.ASVDM.N said on Tuesday that it is cutting 30 percent of the jobs at its U.S. unit, and will take a one-time charge of $1.3 million in the first quarter. 

 The struggling Dutch market maker, which matches buyers and sellers on the New York Stock Exchange, said the job cuts would result in annual cost savings of $4.5 million going forward. Van der Moolen and its rivals with specialist market-making operations have been hit by growth in electronic trading and are adopting a hybrid model that combines floor trading with an automated platform. "This action is being taken as the NYSE completes the move of all listed securities to its new Hybrid Market system later today," Van der Moolen said in a statement. Van der Moolen said that it was cutting the job as the New York Stock Exchange, a unit of NYSE Group Inc. NYX.N, shifts all of its listed securities to a hybrid trading model, reducing the need for human market-makers to match buy and sell orders. Van der Moolen, traditionally based on the Amsterdam bourse, is also listed in New York VDM.N where it is a top-ten market makers. The bulk of the group's trading income is generated in the United States and in the third quarter of last year, Van der Moolen Holding took impairment charges on its U.S. business.
