 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - US Airways Group Inc.'s ( LCC.N ) hostile $10.1-billion bid for Delta Air Lines DALRQ.PK may be losing appeal among creditors who will determine the Atlanta airline's fate, The Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday, citing people familiar with the deal. 

 Delta's creditor committee has grown skeptical of the proposed merger after digging into details of US Airways' offer, the sources told the Journal. Representatives of the committee and Delta have been trying to iron out issues related to the airline's hope to leave bankruptcy. How the Delta board will be selected, senior management's compensation and how to compensate non-union Delta employees are among the issues, the newspaper said. In a reorganization plan filed on Friday, Delta gave creditors a larger say in its future. It said it would soon present its analysis of US Airways' takeover bid to its board.
