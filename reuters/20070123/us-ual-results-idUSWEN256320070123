 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - UAL Corp., parent of No. 2 U.S. carrier United Airlines, on Tuesday posted a larger-than-expected fourth-quarter loss after December snow storms snarled operations in Chicago and Denver, sending shares sinking. 

 The loss still narrowed dramatically from a year earlier, when results were burdened heavily by reorganization costs as the company prepared to exit bankruptcy. The carrier benefited in 2006 from a series of industrywide fare increases as it flew fuller planes. UAL's shares were down about 8 percent in afternoon trading on Nasdaq. "Our financial performance is steadily improving, and these results would have been better absent the significant storms in our two largest hubs," said Chief Executive Glenn Tilton on a conference call with analysts and reporters. UAL said the December storms resulted in the cancellation of 3,900 flights throughout the system and a $40 million reduction in passenger revenue. The airline said its quarterly loss amounted to $61 million, or 55 cents per share, compared with $16.9 billion, or $145.47 per share, a year earlier, while the company was in bankruptcy. Wall Street had expected the company to lose 42 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. The company, which emerged from bankruptcy in February 2006, posted revenue of $4.59 billion, compared with $4.39 billion a year earlier. "The numbers were not as good as we thought they'd be back in October," said Helane Becker, analyst at The Benchmark Co. High fuel costs are also pushing airlines to try to raise ticket prices, which Becker said appeared to have begun affecting demand. "We are seeing demand slow down because of higher ticket prices," Becker said. The airline industry has mounted a recovery in the last year, thanks to a trend toward higher fares. Last week, UAL's chief rival AMR Corp., parent of American Airlines, reported its first profitable year since 2000. UAL, which has been battered along with the rest of the industry by soaring fuel costs, said it paid 2.3 percent less for fuel in the fourth quarter than it did a year earlier. UAL said it has hedged 33 percent of its expected first-quarter fuel consumption, capping the cost at $74 per barrel of crude oil, which is directly related to the price of jet fuel. NYMEX crude oil futures CLc1> traded near $55 a barrel on Tuesday. The carrier, which expects its jet fuel expense to average $1.89 per gallon in the first quarter, said it has hedged 23 percent of its predicted second-quarter fuel consumption. UAL ended the quarter with $5 billion in cash, including $847 million in restricted cash. Chief Financial Officer Jake Brace said on a conference call that UAL plans to reduce its cash balance by about $1 billion by paying down debt. Shares of UAL gained 63 percent in the fourth quarter, outpacing the Amex airline index, which rose 23 percent in the same time period. UAL's results come against a backdrop of speculation of impending consolidation in the industry. Delta Air Lines Inc. is currently fending off a hostile bid from US Airways Group. UAL has had merger talks with Continental Airlines Inc., according to sources. Although UAL has not confirmed the talks, Chief Executive Glenn Tilton has long been an advocate of consolidation. UAL shares were down 8 percent, or $3.90, at $44.85 in afternoon trading. (Additional reporting by  Paritosh Bansal  in New York)
