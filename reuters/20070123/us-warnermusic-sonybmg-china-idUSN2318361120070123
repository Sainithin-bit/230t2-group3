 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Sony BMG Music Entertainment and Warner Music Group WMG.N announced on Tuesday strategic investments in a Chinese company that makes technology to download songs on to mobile phones in China. 

 Eyeing the potentially lucrative Chinese market, which has about 460 million mobile phone users, Sony BMG and Warner Music have invested in Access China Media Solutions, a partnership between U.S.-based digital content delivery company Melodeo Inc. and Japan's Access Co. Ltd. The record companies said they saw mobile phones as the future of the Chinese music industry, which has been hampered by rampant piracy. Access China will be focused on developing technology to help consumers download complete songs to their phones, moving beyond the delivery of ringtones and ringback tones. "We think a good chunk of those consumers will be looking at their phones as an entertainment device," said Thomas Hesse, president of global digital business at Sony BMG, the second largest record company. The music industry sees mobile distribution, which is for the most part controlled by cellular network operators, as a more secure way to distribute music than the Internet or CDs. The record companies said the focus of the deal will mainly be on local repertoire. Sony BMG, a joint venture between Sony Corp. ( 6758.T ) and Bertelsmann BERT.UL, said it already has one of the largest catalogs of Mandarin-language music in the world. Warner Music, the world's fourth largest record company, signed a deal in June with China's second-largest mobile operator China Unicom ( 0762.HK ) ( CHU.N ) to sell its music over its wireless network. "Mobile's clearly the future of music in China," said Michael Nash, senior vice president of digital and business development at Warner Music. He said working with the mobile carriers to sell music securely would be vital to the future of China's music industry. "Physical piracy in China is an enormous problem that's created a crisis around investment in repertoire and artists," he said. Both record companies said they would work with Access China to negotiate with local mobile operators.
