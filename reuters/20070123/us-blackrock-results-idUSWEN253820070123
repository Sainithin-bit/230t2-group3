 BOSTON  (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc. ( BLK.N ), a leading U.S. asset manager, on Wednesday posted stronger quarterly earnings as demand for its products increased and assets under management surged. 

 BlackRock, which grew from a small bond shop into a booming investment management business and recently bought Merrill Lynch's fund unit, said net income rose to $169.4 million, or $1.28 per diluted share in the fourth quarter, compared with $72.9 million, or $1.09 a year ago. Excluding a charge of 25 cents for the integration of the Merrill unit and other items, the company posted adjusted earnings of $1.61 a share, compared with the average Wall Street estimate of $1.53.
