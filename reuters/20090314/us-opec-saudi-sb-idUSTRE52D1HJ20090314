 VIENNA  (Reuters) - OPEC's compliance with its existing oil output cuts is over 80 percent but could be better, Saudi Arabian Oil Minister Ali al-Naimi said on Saturday. 

 "Compliance is very good," Naimi told reporters. "We'd like to see compliance as high as possible, it is over 80 percent now, it can be better." OPEC has made cuts totaling 4.2 million barrels per day since September. The group has yet to fulfill around 800,000 bpd of these and many in OPEC say that has to be achieved before the group considers cutting output further. Naimi said the cuts were proving effective in reducing oversupply. "Inventories are coming down and will come down in due time," he said. OPEC, which meets on Sunday, faces falling demand for its oil due to the world economic downturn. "We know that oil demand is significantly lower in 2009 than in 2008," Naimi said. "You have to understand that the world economy is not as healthy as it should be, we should expect demand worldwide to be down." Naimi was asked if the group had a target price in mind for oil. "It is the price that the marginal producer needs to invest," he said, declining to give a figure. Saudi Arabia itself was 100 percent compliant with its share of OPEC cuts, he said.
