 (Reuters) - Dell Inc's president of global operations, Michael Cannon, and chief marketing officer, Mark Jarvis will leave their roles in moves expected to be announced soon, the Wall Street Journal said, citing people briefed on the matter. 

 The people told the paper that they expect Jarvis to leave Dell, while Cannon will likely stay on in a different capacity. Other changes are expected to focus on cutting costs and gaining tighter control over the company's global operations, the people told the paper. Two people with knowledge of the situation told the paper that Dell may also make cuts to its lower executive ranks. The impending changes are intended to make managing Dell's world-wide business more efficient, people briefed on the matter told the Journal. Operations now divided by geography will be consolidated into international business units, a shift Dell made earlier this year with its consumer division, the paper said. A Dell spokesman declined to comment to the paper on any changes, but said Dell has "been in a two-year process of positioning the company best for customers and long-term growth." Dell could not be immediately reached for comment by Reuters. (Reporting by  Ajay Kamalakaran  in Bangalore; Editing by Kim Coghill)
