 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - LyondellBasell, the world's third-largest petrochemical company, is considering filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection as it tries to restructure debt, a company spokeswoman said on Wednesday. 

 "As we have said publicly, we are looking to restructure our debt and we are exploring all of our options. Filing for Chapter 11 is one of those options," spokeswoman Susan Moore said. The company said it has hired advisers, including Evercore, Alix Partners and New York law firm Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft LLP, to counsel it as it restructures. The news comes as LyondellBasell has struggled with decreasing demand for petrochemicals and cut production at some locations amid a global economic downturn. It also reflects the unwinding of debt built up during recent years when banks lent money cheaply, especially in leveraged buyouts. Tribune Co ( TRBCQ.PK ), Mervyn's and Linens 'N Things LNNHDL.UL are just a few examples of companies that have succumbed to such debt loads this year. Companies that have tried to renegotiate their debt loads have found it difficult as banks have pulled back on lending. "The combination of what happened in the global marketplace inside a really difficult credit market has put an awful lot of pressure on some of these highly leveraged companies," said Timothy Hanley, vice chairman of Deloitte & Touche, in charge of the company's U.S. process and industrial products segment. "With those kinds of places like Lyondell, which obviously has taken on a significant amount of debt, it just makes it a lot more difficult for them to work through things," Hanley said. RESTRUCTURING DEBT LyondellBasell disclosed in a December 29 regulatory filing that it had begun negotiating with lenders on extending payment dates and restructuring debt. It negotiated one postponement on $160 million in loan-related fees, the filing said. Its lenders include Merrill Lynch MER.N, Goldman Sachs ( GS.N ), Citigroup ( C.N ), ABN AMRO ABNIGLO.CO and UBS ( UBSN.VX ) Securities LLC, according to the regulatory filing. The company has $26 billion in debt, according to Standard & Poor's, which slashed the company's rating to "selective default" on Tuesday. Moody's Investors Service also cut the company's rating two notches, to Caa2 from B2. S&P said that the company had also postponed $120 million of interest due under notes it had issued. LyondellBasell ACCEIN.UL was created last December when Dutch-based Basell, a unit of Russian-born billionaire Len Blavatnik's Access Industries, bought Houston-based Lyondell for about $12.7 billion. News of a possible bankruptcy filing drove down LyondellBasell bonds, which trade in London, on Wednesday. Its 500 million euro bond, due to mature in 2015, was bid at 4 percent of face value and offered at 8 percent, down from 8 percent bid in the weeks prior to Christmas, a trader in London said. "The advisers have been appointed, so now we will have to wait to see what proposals they come up with. But bondholders and second lien investors will have to take massive haircuts if there is some decision made to keep the company going with Access putting more money in," the trader said. Hiring advisers does not necessarily mean that a company will file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Some companies are able to restructure debt and operations outside of court. NO EFFECT ON REFINERY SUPPLIES News of a possible bankruptcy can negatively affect a company's ability to receive supplies from vendors who are worried about being compensated by a bankrupt firm. The company, which owns and operates two crude oil refineries in Houston and in France, said there had been no changes at refinery operations. The LyondellBasell refinery in Houston is one of North America's largest, capable of producing 270,600 barrels per day of motor fuel. A second refinery, just acquired last April, is located in France and can process 105,000 barrels per day.
