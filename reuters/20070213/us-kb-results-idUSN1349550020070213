 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - KB Home ( KBH.N ), a leading U.S. home builder, on Tuesday posted a smaller-than-expected quarterly net loss after a $343.3 million noncash for declining land values, sending its shares up 1.6 percent. 


 The company reported a net loss of $49.6 million, or 64 cents per share, for the fiscal fourth quarter that ended November 30, compared with net income of $304.4 million, or $3.44 per share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 13 percent to $3.55 billion. Analysts on average had expected the company to post a net loss of $1.14 per share on revenue of $2.73 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. Net orders fell 38 percent in the quarter to 6,059, KB Home said. The cancellation rate was 48 percent in the fourth quarter, up from 31 percent a year earlier but down from 53 percent in the third quarter. Gross margins fell to 11.7 percent including the land charges and 18.8 percent without them from a record 27.1 percent in the fourth quarter 2005, in part because of sales incentives used to entice buyers. "While this is slightly backward looking given KB's November fiscal year, as opposed to other builders' recently reported results for December-end quarters and commentary on January trends, we remain encouraged that, similar to other builders, KB's orders and (cancellation) rates both showed modest sequential improvement," JP Morgan analysts Michael Rehaut wrote in a note. The company, whose stock options practices have prompted a formal government probe and forced its long-time chief to step down, said it would file restated financials for the quarter that ended August 31, 2006, as well as its annual report for fiscal 2006. "Both reports include restated financial statements for prior periods," it said. The company did not issue a specific outlook for its current fiscal year. "In light of uncertain future market conditions, we anticipate that our unit deliveries, revenues, gross margins and earnings per share in 2007 will be below 2006 levels," the company said. KB shares rose 84 cents to $52.78 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The Dow Jones U.S. Home Construction Index .DJUSHB, a yardstick that measures home builder performance, rose 0.72 percent.
