 XIAMEN, China  (Reuters) - Dell Inc. DELL.O expects production in China for domestic sales to keep growing at about 30 percent in the short term, meaning the PC giant might add another factory there in three to four years, its top manufacturing executive for the country said. 


 In the fiscal third quarter of 2006, the world's second-largest PC maker logged 33 percent growth in the number of computers made and sold in the country -- roughly double the overall pace of market growth but in line with Dell's average. Despite conceding global market share to Hewlett-Packard Co. ( HPQ.N ) in past quarters -- partly spurring the return of founder Michael Dell -- York Li told Reuters on Tuesday the firm hoped to build on a 10 percent market share in China. "That's why you can imagine, in three or four years we'll need another factory," Li, managing director of the China Customer Center -- which combines manufacturing and after-sales service -- told Reuters in the southern port city of Xiamen. Asked if he thought Dell could sustain growth at 30 percent in coming quarters, Li said: "Yeah, we expect this to continue." In China -- a $2 billion business for the computer titan -- Dell is the fastest-growing player and the third-largest PC vendor, after homegrown powerhouse Lenovo Group Ltd. ( 0992.HK ) -- which commands more than a third of the domestic arena -- and Founder Technology ( 600601.SS ). Production is equivalent to sales for Dell because of a quick-turnaround, direct business model in which each computer is assembled to customer-specified standards. Dell built a 594,000 sq ft factory in Xiamen last year to make computers for export to Japan, South Korea and Hong Kong, alongside an existing plant that focuses on the domestic market and cranks out 4 to 5 million PCs annually. At the factory, workers' hands blur as they snap and screw made-to-order PCs together -- piece by piece -- in production cells, as opposed to Henry Ford-style assembly lines, then pass them down a conveyor to quality testers and packaging teams. CATCHING ON The country -- Dell's largest market after the United States and Britain -- now accounts for about a 10th of Dell's global production capability, Li said. Dell's official production objective is modest: to match the market's growth of about 15 percent, said Sharon Zhang, Director of Corporate Communications for China and Hong Kong. The firm is known for a direct sales business model that cuts out middle-men and allows the company to deal directly with consumer and business customers. But analysts have questioned whether it could work in a developing country like China, where customers prefer to see before they buy. Li argued it took a decade for the model to catch on in the United States, and that the China market should follow suit. Since Dell entered China in 1998, it has captured some 10 percent of the world's second biggest PC market. In the United States, Dell commands about 30 percent of the market, Li said. "If you look at the ramp-up, China is much faster than the U.S.," he said. "Ten percent is just a good start. Normally after 10 percent it can ramp up faster." Amid criticism of faltering customer support elsewhere, Dell last year doubled the size of its technical support team in the country to about 600 people, said Roger Lin, director of technical support. Lin and Li were excited to have the company's founder, known for his directness, back in the driver's seat, and expected Dell himself to visit later this year. "We're quite pumped up for this," Lin said. "He doesn't try to put lipstick on pigs."
