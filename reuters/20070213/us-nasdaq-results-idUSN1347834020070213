 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Nasdaq Stock Market Inc. ( NDAQ.O ) issued a disappointing 2007 earnings forecast on Tuesday, overshadowing strong quarterly earnings and sending its shares down 12 percent. 


 David Warren, chief financial officer of the largest U.S. electronic exchange, said on a conference call that 2007 earnings would be $180 million to $190 million -- which would translate to $1.18 per share to $1.25 per share based on the number outstanding and was below average Wall Street expectations. Analysts polled by Reuters Estimates had forecast, on average, earnings of $1.51 a share before special items. "Overall guidance disappointed people," said Fox-Pitt, Kelton analyst Edward Ditmire. "It seems the source of forecasts differing from people's expectations are higher- than-expected carrying costs for the London Stock Exchange stake." Nasdaq expects to carry about $800 million to $850 million of senior debt in 2007 after an optional March payment, Chief Executive Robert Greifeld said on the conference call. As part of a failed LSE takeover attempt, Nasdaq had spent approximately $1.3 billion to purchase just under a third of the U.K. exchange. One-time expenses related to delaying the retirement of a trading platform and exiting a contract with financial services firm SunGard Data Systems Inc. also added $22 million to 2007 expenses above Nasdaq's prior estimate, CFO Warren said. The bad news eclipsed Nasdaq's strong fourth-quarter results. Net income more than tripled, rising to $63 million, or 43 cents per share, from $17.1 million, or 15 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding a one-time gain from currency contracts, earnings were 24 cents a share, matching the average forecast of analysts polled by Reuters Estimates. Fourth-quarter revenue jumped 72 percent to $447.3 million, driven by higher trading volume and new order fees that U.S. regulators began permitting during the quarter. Nasdaq's new forecasts assume 2007 volume would be flat in Nasdaq-listed securities and would increase by about 20 percent in New York Stock Exchange-listed securities. Nasdaq shares were down $4.20 to $30.90 in afternoon trade on the New York Stock Exchange, adding to losses of 4.7 percent on Monday. "Ultimately I would understand the drop, with guidance being so disappointing," said Fox-Pitt's Ditmire, who was surprised by the steep decline. "But I think when people see the disappointment is from LSE carrying costs and not from any deficiency in the fundamental forecast for operating income, we will probably see some recovery." Over the weekend, Nasdaq suffered a setback when London Stock Exchange ( LSE.L ) shareholders overwhelmingly rejected Nasdaq's $5.3 billion (2.7 billion pound) hostile takeover bid. LSE shares closed at 1,282 pence on Friday, a 3 percent premium to Nasdaq's offer of 1,243 pence per share. "We chose not to win this bid," said CEO Greifeld on the call, citing Nasdaq's "disciplined approach" to the offer, which was criticized by LSE shareholders as low. The LSE stake had increased in value by 13 percent to $1.5 billion, Greifeld added. Forecasts given on the conference call also assume Nasdaq would keep the LSE stake in 2007 but the company would be considering available options, CFO Warren said. "There are opportunities out there and it runs really across the spectrum and across the globe," said CEO Greifeld. "And we will be involved with transactions in 2007." SHARE OF NYSE-LISTED TRADING RISES Nasdaq's share of New York Stock Exchange-listed trading increased to 13.9 percent from 12.1 percent in the third quarter and 5.7 percent in the year-ago fourth quarter. Market share in Nasdaq-listed trading declined to 46.5 percent from 48.7 percent in the third quarter. Higher listing fees proposed by Nasdaq during the quarter also received regulatory approval earlier this month, although the proposal had been amended to exclude services like press release dissemination by PrimeNewswire, which Nasdaq acquired in September.
