 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Honda Motor Co. ( 7267.T ) said on Tuesday 
it would recall 45,335 Civic hybrid cars globally to fix a 
faulty voltage converter that could cause a short circuit and 
stop the engine. 


  No accidents have been reported from the defect, a 
spokesman said.  The total includes 31,123 units to be recalled in the 
United States and 7,219 in Japan.  The recall would cost about 5,300 yen ($44) per vehicle in 
Japan, the spokesman said. At that estimate, the recall would 
cost roughly $2 million globally.  The free repair covers 2006 model year Civic hybrids built 
between September 2005 and September 2006.  ($1=121.43 Yen)
