 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Levi Strauss & Co. said on Tuesday that quarterly net profit more than doubled, helped by higher operating income and lower tax expense. 


 In the fourth quarter, net profit rose to $96 million from $44 million a year earlier, the privately held jeans maker said. Sales rose 4 percent to $1.24 billion, with improvement in all the company's regions. Gross margins rose during the quarter, helped by more sales of higher-margin goods, the San Francisco-based company said. The higher margins and revenues boosted quarterly operating income 40 percent to $170 million from $121 a year earlier. Despite its iconic status and worldwide name recognition, Levi Strauss has faced eroding market share due to a host of competitors. In a bid to make the brand hip again, the San Francisco-based company has been revamping its jeans and apparel lines and has trimmed costs around the globe to boost profit.
