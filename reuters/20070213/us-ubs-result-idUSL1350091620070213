 ZURICH  (Reuters) - UBS ( UBSN.VX ), the world's largest wealth manager, reported record full-year profits as its wealth management and investment banking units boomed, hiked its dividend and unveiled a 16 billion Swiss franc ($12.77 billion) share buyback. 


 The Swiss-based group reported full-year net profit of 12.257 billion francs and net new money for the full year into asset and wealth management of 151.7 billion francs. But reassurances from Chief Executive Peter Wuffli that a hiring spree was over and that the cost/income ratio -- a key measure of efficiency -- should stabilize failed to prevent investors from selling UBS stock lower on cost concerns. Shares fell 1.1 percent to 78.70 francs by 0911 GMT, to be the biggest blue-chip losers in Europe, on concerns over rising costs after the group took on 8,500 new staff in 2006. "We have seen hiring acceleration in the second half. We feel to a significant extent we are done with the buildup," Wuffli said at a news conference. RECORD BREAKER UBS said fourth-quarter net profit from continuing operations rose 19 percent to 3.145 billion francs from a year earlier, driven in part by a record performance in investment banking. The result was well ahead of analysts' expectations. The 17 analysts polled by Reuters had on average predicted net profit of 2.727 billion francs. The strong performance had washed over into 2007 "with a very strong pipeline in business opportunities in capital markets and investment banking," said Chief Financial Officer Clive Standish in a conference call with journalists. The Swiss bank proposed a dividend payout of 2.20 francs per share, up from 1.60 francs a year earlier and announced a new three-year share buyback program worth about 16 billion francs at the current share price level. Net profit was 2.199 billion francs in the third quarter of 2006 and 2.597 billion from continuing operations in the final quarter of 2005, when net gains from the sale of private banks and GAM, a hedge fund sold by UBS, boosted total net profit to 6.487 billion. UBS said net new money inflows into its wealth management business in the fourth quarter were 21.7 billion francs, exactly in line with analysts' forecasts and up from 19.7 billion francs in the fourth quarter of 2005. "Overall it's a very good result," said Andreas Venditti, a banking analyst at Zuericher Kantonal Bank. "If you look at pretax results, it's across the board. Investment banking is good, especially on equity revenues, fixed income is not that great but advisory income from investment banking is very good," said Venditti. UBS said total operating income in the fourth quarter in investment banking was up 22 percent at 5.602 billion francs with equities business surging 33 percent. The results came after UBS faltered in the third quarter, against expectations, when a bet on U.S. interest rates went wrong, hitting bonds and equities trading revenues. UBS 2005 results had been distorted by one-off gains from the sale of some of the Swiss bank's private banking businesses to Julius Baer. UBS said its cost-income ratio in the fourth quarter was 70.6 percent in the financial business, slightly improved from 70.9 percent in the final quarter of 2005. COSTS Investors are focusing on UBS's growing cost base as it expands with a string of acquisitions, which last year included Brazilian wealth manager Banco Pactual, the brokerage business of Piper Jaffray and McDonald Investments in the United States. "They took on 8,500 new staff in the new year and that is very substantial," said Venditti. "The costs are still there and this is still weighing on the result." Hopes were high that UBS, Europe's second largest bank with a market capitalization of $134.83 billion, would deliver strong numbers after Deutsche Bank and U.S. investment banks such as Goldman Sachs reported a surge in 2005 profits. UBS shares, reflecting its strong wealth management franchise, trade at 14.15 times estimated 2007 earnings, compared with Deutsche Bank, on a multiple of 9.84 and Credit Suisse on 13.02.
