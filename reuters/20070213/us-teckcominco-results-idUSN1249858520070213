 VANCOUVER, British Columbia  (Reuters) - Teck Cominco Ltd ( TCKb.TO ) said on Monday it had sharply higher earnings in the fourth quarter on strong commodity prices and delayed sales from its Red Dog mine. 


 The world's biggest zinc producer also said it would use its excess cash to repurchase some shares, split others and spend C$300 million ($255 million) to extend the life of its Highland Valley copper mine by six years. The company said it earned C$866 million, or C$4.02 a share in the quarter. That was up from a profit of C$510 million, or C$2.50 a share, in the same period a year earlier. The latest results were also boosted by a C$115 million after-tax gain on the sale of shares of Inco Ltd. Analysts had expected Teck to earn C$3.55 a share, according to a poll by Reuters Estimates. Revenues from operations were C$2.1 billion, up from C$1.3 billion a year ago, due largely to higher copper and zinc prices and stronger sales of refined metal from its Trail, British Columbia, smelter, the company said. Teck said its operating profit in the quarter was C$1.2 billion, up from C$686 million in the same period a year earlier, as the company benefited from a weather-related issue that hurt it in the third quarter. Weather conditions at its Red Dog zinc mine in Alaska had caused shipping delays, so material that had been expected to be transported from the site in the third quarter got delayed into the fourth quarter. Teck produced 77,000 metric tons of refined zinc in the fourth quarter, compared with 67,000 metric tons in the same period a year earlier. It sold 71,000 metric tons of refined zinc compared with 59,000 metric tons. Copper production was 70,000 metric tons, down from 72,000 metric tons. SHARE SPLITS, LONGER MINE LIFE The company said it had cash on hand of C$5.3 billion at the end of December, an increase of C$1.5 billion over the quarter. Teck also said on Monday it would use some of that excess cash to buy up to 20 million of its class B shares, but then ask shareholders to approve a two-for-one split its class A and class B shares. The share repurchase would constitute about 9.6 percent of the public float of class B shares before the split, the company said. The Vancouver-based company said it also plans to expand a pit and extend the life of its Highland Valley mine in British Columbia to 2019, a move that will produce 1.5 billion pounds of copper and 21 million pounds of molybdenum in concentrate.
