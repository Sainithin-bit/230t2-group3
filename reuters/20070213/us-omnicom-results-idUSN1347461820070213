 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Omnicom Group Inc. ( OMC.N ), the world's largest advertising services company, said on Tuesday fourth-quarter profit rose nearly 10 percent as it reaped the benefits of investments overseas, including China. 


 Omnicom, home to advertising agencies such as BBDO Worldwide and DDB Worldwide, said profit rose to $277.2 million, or $1.62 a share, from $252.6 million, or $1.41 share, a year earlier. Worldwide revenue rose 9.4 percent to $3.22 billion, boosted by a broad mix of media services in the United States and overseas. Organic revenue, a closely watched industry benchmark that excludes foreign currency impact and recent acquisitions, rose 6.6 percent. Its organic revenue growth was less than some analysts had forecast, and while profit met expectations, shares of the company were down nearly 2 percent in midday trade. Merrill Lynch analyst Lauren Fine, who had been looking for organic growth of 7 percent, said in a note to clients that the growth is "still likely to best all of its peers." She added: "We continue to view the valuation as attractive as we believe this is the highest quality name in the agency sector that can deliver double digit EPS growth over the next few years with a number of levers to achieve it." Shares of Omnicom have risen about 25 percent in the last year, hitting a 52-week high on Feb 8. The company has tried to position itself at home to take advantage of a shift by advertisers to unconventional marketing methods, from Internet campaigns to special events. At the same time, it has sought to move into hot geographic markets like India and China. "We made more progress in the last two years than in the 15 years that proceeded," Omnicom Chief Executive John Wren said on a conference call, when asked about China. "I'm very bullish, given the position that we have, that we're going to move forward very, very fast." He added: "Geographically, our No. 1 priority is still Asia." The United States, where money is increasingly shifting from traditional advertising to new media advertising, still accounted for about 52 percent of Omnicom's fourth-quarter revenue even though it grew at a slower pace. Domestic revenue rose 7 percent to $1.69 billion, while international revenue rose 12.3 percent to $1.53 billion. While Omnicom's earnings and revenue matched analysts' expectations, the company did suffer setbacks in 2006, notably the loss of the Wal-Mart Stores ( WMT.N ) account. But Wren said withdrawing from the final round of pitches for the world's largest retailer -- which had long been held by its GSD&M agency -- was a "sound business decision." He also said any recent account losses were not part of a broader issue at the company and had to be put in context. "When you look at Omnicom and the size of Omnicom, these are not impactful to our ability to continue to deliver the numbers and I don't think they are reflective of a trend or of an issue," he said. Overall, the company said its net new business activity totaled about $950 million in the fourth quarter. Omnicom shares were down $2.00 at $102.76 in midday trade on the New York Stock Exchange.
