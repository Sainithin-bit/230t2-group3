 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Embattled U.S. shopping mall owner Mills Corp. MLS.N said on Tuesday a roughly $1.56 billion takeover offer from Simon Property Group Inc. ( SPG.N ) and Farallon Capital Management is superior to a rival bid by Brookfield Asset Management Inc. ( BAMa.TO ). 


 Mills said its board plans to terminate the deal reached last month with Brookfield, which offered $21 per share, or $1.36 billion, unless, within three business days, Mills and Brookfield "amend" their agreement or Brookfield betters the Simon and Farallon transaction. Mills would not elaborate on what it meant by "amend." The offer by Simon, the largest U.S. mall owner and Farallon, Mills' largest shareholder, is for $24 per share. Mills shares rose almost 1 percent to $26 on Tuesday morning as some investors bet that an even higher offer could yet surface. Mills said on Tuesday its board considered a number of factors, including the higher price offered by Simon and Farallon and the likelihood that the transaction could be completed more quickly than the Brookfield merger. Despite an accounting scandal and cash-flow problems, Mills still controls malls that include highly desirable U.S. locations. To bidders, the properties' value could outweigh Mills' potential problems, which include an investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
