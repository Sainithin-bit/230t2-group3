 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. oil and gas producer XTO Energy Inc. XTO.N on Tuesday said fourth-quarter profit declined 5 percent as lower natural gas prices and higher expenses weighed on results. 


 Net profit was $429 million, or $1.16 cents a share, compared with $453 million, or $1.22 a share in the same quarter a year earlier. Excluding special items, XTO said its profit was $1.14 cents a share. On that basis, analysts were on average expecting the company to earn $1.13 a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue increased 2 percent to $1.2 billion despite a 14 percent decline in realized gas prices from the year-ago period. That price decline was offset by a 12 percent increase in daily gas production. TXO said it expects annual production volume to grow 10 percent in 2007.
