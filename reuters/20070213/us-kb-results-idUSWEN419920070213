 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - KB Home ( KBH.N ), a leading U.S. home builder, posted a quarterly net loss on Tuesday as it took $343.3 million of pretax charges for abandoning land option contracts and writing down the value of inventory, a consequence of the U.S. housing market downturn. 


 The company reported a net loss of $49.6 million, or 64 cents per share, for the fiscal fourth quarter ended November 30, compared with net income of $304.4 million, or $3.44 per share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 13 percent to $3.55 billion. Net orders fell 38 percent in the quarter to 6,059, KB Home said. The cancellation rate was 48 percent in the fourth quarter, up from 31 percent a year earlier but down from 53 percent in the third quarter. The company, whose stock options practices have prompted a formal government probe and forced its long-time chief to step down, said it would file restated financials for the quarter ended August 31, 2006, as well as its annual report for fiscal 2006. "Both reports include restated financial statements for prior periods," it said.
