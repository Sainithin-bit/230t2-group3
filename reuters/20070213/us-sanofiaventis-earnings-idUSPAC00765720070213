 PARIS  (Reuters) - Sanofi-Aventis posted higher than expected fourth-quarter profits on Tuesday and predicted more growth for 2007, but a further delay in its key new anti-obesity drug Acomplia hit the shares. 


 The world's third largest drugmaker declined to comment on persistent rumors that it was looking to take over U.S. group Bristol-Myers Squibb. Sanofi said it had made a current operating profit of 2.272 billion euros ($2.95 billion) in the final quarter of 2006, and a net profit excluding exceptional items of 1.377 billion, beating the average of forecasts from 15 analysts polled by Reuters. The results were tarnished, however, by a three-month delay in the U.S. regulatory review of key new anti-obesity drug Acomplia, to July 27. Company officials declined to give the reasons behind Monday's decision by the Food and Drug Administration -- the latest in a series of delays for the product in the United States. "The numbers were a little bit better than expected but investors will be concerned that Acomplia is being delayed by three months in the U.S.," Martin Hall, an analyst with London stockbroking and asset management group Eden, said. Shares in Sanofi fell 2 percent to 66.45 euros by 1010 GMT. Chief Financial Officer Jean-Claude Leroy cautioned that generic competition would make 2007 a difficult year. "We still expect a certain level of generification in 2007 ... The year will be difficult because of these phenomena," he told reporters. R&D NEWS FAILS TO INSPIRE Sanofi said its pipeline of experimental drugs now included 46 products in Phase IIb and final-stage Phase III clinical trials and it would submit 12 new products for approval in 2007 and 2008. But two cancer projects were discontinued and experimental antidepressant saredutant -- one of its most keenly awaited new drugs -- reported mixed results in late-stage clinical studies. Sanofi said it remained optimistic about saredutant, since other Phase III studies are ongoing, and it also has high hopes for another medicine for depression and anxiety, called amibegron. Analysts, however, said there was not much to inspire in the R&D news. "The development pipeline update offers little in the way of positive news," commented analysts at UBS, who also said implied earnings guidance of 2.9 percent growth in 2007, after currency adjustment, was disappointing. New drugs in store are key for Sanofi's future earnings growth, which has been clouded by healthcare savings and patent expires or generic attacks on blockbusters such as allergy pill Allegra and bloodthinners Plavix and Lovenox. New research head Marc Cluzel told reporters the company planned to hold an R&D day for investors in September to explain the potential of a drug pipeline which he said was not well understood. SILENT ON M&A Sanofi declined to comment on speculation that it and U.S. giant Bristol-Myers had been in talks for the French firm to buy the smaller U.S. group or whether those discussions had now ceased. Buying Bristol-Myers could make strategic sense, according to industry analysts, but it would be a financial stretch and could dilute earnings in the near term. Sanofi trades on 13 times forecast 2007 earnings, a discount of around 20 percent to the European sector, according to Reuters data. Sanofi has been dealt several blows in the past year, notably by the surprise U.S. launch of a generic to its Plavix bloodthinner, as well as the fact it is still awaiting U.S. marketing approval for Acomplia, which it had hoped to launch a year ago in the world's top drugs market. It also suffered a setback when U.S. regulators rejected its heart drug Multaq and only last week it lost the patent on Lovenox in a U.S. court ruling, although analysts believe generic drugmakers still face hurdles in launching a copycat form of the complex medicine.
