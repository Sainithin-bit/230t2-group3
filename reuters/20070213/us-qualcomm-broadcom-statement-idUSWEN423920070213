 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Wireless chip developer Qualcomm Inc. ( QCOM.O ) said on Tuesday Broadcom Corp.'s ( BRCM.O ) statement Monday on a partial summary judgment ruling by a federal court in San Diego was misleading. 


 "Broadcom's assertions that this ruling 'clears the way for cellular handset makers Samsung and Panasonic to continue using Broadcom's chips in WCDMA-based handsets,' is false and misleading," Qualcomm's general counsel Lou Lupin said in a statement.
