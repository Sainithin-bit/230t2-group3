 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Stock in Alcoa Inc. ( AA.N ) soared as much as 10 percent on Tuesday on reports that two foreign mining companies were looking to acquire the U.S. aluminum giant. 


 But the stock fell back after Lehman Brothers analyst Peter Ward cut his rating on Alcoa to "equal weight/positive" from "overweight/positive," saying a takeover by BHP Billiton Ltd. ( BHP.AX ) ( BLT.L ) or Rio Tinto Ltd. ( RIO.AX ) was "unlikely." While other analysts said Alcoa shares were undervalued, they also poured cold water on the report in the Times newspaper in London that said BHP and Rio were preparing separate bids for Alcoa each worth $40 billion. Sources close to the matter said BHP Billiton was not currently working on a bid, while Alcoa and Rio Tinto declined to comment on market rumors. Shares of the Pittsburgh-based Alcoa climbed $3.15 to $36.05 in early trade on the New York Stock Exchange, before falling back to $34.86 after the Lehman downgrade. BHP Billiton shares rose 2.6 percent in London, while Rio Tinto was off 0.47 percent in Australian trading. Despite recent speculation that Alcoa was up for grabs, analysts were skeptical. One metals industry source said it did not make sense for either BHP Billiton or Rio to buy Alcoa because the aluminum maker has a $10 billion packaging business they do not want. In addition, BHP Billiton would not be interested in Alcoa's smelters because they costly to run and in poor locations, the source told Reuters. But the companies would be interested in their alumina and bauxite businesses, the source added. Some analysts said that based on a sum-of-parts valuation, Alcoa shares could fetch as much as 50 percent above Monday's closing price of $32.90. "Whether or not (a takeover) happens, we believe the latest speculation will at the very least support the shares," Credit Suisse analysts said in a note to investors. Stephen Bailey, vice president of Frontier Strategy Group in Washington told the CNBC cable new channel that both BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto have the assets and capital to go after Alcoa, it was just a matter of which one has the staying power. Other analysts said a spate of mergers in the metals and mining industry, including Hindalco Industries Ltd.'s ( HALC.BO ) planned takeover of Novelis Inc. NVL.TO, had fueled speculation that BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto would seek to buy Alcoa. "If you're the size of a BHP or Rio Tinto, all you've got left (to buy) is Alcoa or Alcan Inc. AL.TO," said Victor Lazarovici, an analyst with BMO Nesbitt Burns. Analysts said Alcoa's production facilities would likely make for a difficult fit for either BHP Billiton or Rio Tinto. "The idea of them moving downstream into fabricated or semi-fabricated products, although that would add to their revenue base and give them great visibility on the demand side of the aluminum business -- it's very foreign to their business models," said James Southwood, president of Commodity Metals Management Co. in Pittsburgh.
