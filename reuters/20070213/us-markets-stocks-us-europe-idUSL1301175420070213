 LONDON  (Reuters) - U.S. shares are expected to rise on Tuesday, with a focus on earnings from firms including Affiliated Computer Services ( ACS.N ) and Applied Materials ( AMAT.O ) and as Alcoa's shares ( AA.F ) ( AA.N ) surged 9 percent in German trade on bid speculation. 


 The Times reported that BHP Billiton ( BLT.L ) and Rio Tinto ( RIO.L ) have drawn up separate plans for a $40 billion bid for the aluminum producer but a source told Reuters that BHP Billiton is not currently working on a bid for Alcoa. By 1120 GMT, both S&P SPc1 and Nasdaq NDc1 were up 0.05 percent, while Dow futures DJc1 gained 0.1 percent. U.S. stocks slipped on Monday after a 3.5 percent drop in oil prices hit energy companies' shares, while worries about rising mortgage defaults spilled over onto the banking and housing sectors for the third day. U.S. crude oil prices slipped below $58 a barrel on Tuesday, extending a $2 slide from the previous day on signs that OPEC will refrain from further oil supply cuts when it meets in March. CVS ( CVS.N ) and Caremark CMX.N will be eyed after CVS's $23.7 billion takeover bid for pharmacy benefit manager Caremark suffered another blow after Institutional Shareholder Services, an influential proxy advisory firm, urged Caremark shareholders to reject the deal. Among other stocks in focus, general drugmaker Teva Pharmaceutical TEVA.O expects its sales to top $10 billion in 2008 and earnings per share would exceed $2.50, Chief Financial Officer Dan Suesskind forecast. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  lost 0.2 percent to end at 12,552.5, while the Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  fell nearly 0.4 percent to 2,450.4. Later in the week, markets will focus on Fed Chairman Bernanke's testimony on Capitol Hill. The central bank's semiannual monetary policy report, due on Wednesday and Thursday, might give some hint on the outlook for U.S. interest rates amid strong economic data.
