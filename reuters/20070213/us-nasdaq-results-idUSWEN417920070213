 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Nasdaq Stock Market Inc. ( NDAQ.O ) said on Tuesday that quarterly earnings more than tripled, helped by strong trade revenue. 


 Fourth-quarter net income was $63 million, or 43 cents per share, versus $17.1 million, or 15 cents per share, in the year-earlier period. Excluding a one-time gain from currency contracts, Nasdaq earned 24 cents a share, matching average analyst expectations according to Reuters Estimates. "Despite a noisy quarter, we would expect the shares to move higher today on the news," wrote Keefe, Bruyette & Woods analyst Richard Herr in a note to clients. Nasdaq shares were up 1.7 percent in pre-market trading on Tuesday, after falling 4.7 percent the prior day. Over the weekend Nasdaq suffered a strategic setback when London Stock Exchange ( LSE.L ) shareholders overwhelmingly rejected a $5.3 billion (2.7-billion-pound) hostile bid, leaving Nasdaq with just under a third of LSE shareholdings. "Overall, good operating results are more important looking forward than costs associated with the failed LSE bid, whose residual stake will likely be transitory," wrote Fox-Pitt, Kelton analyst Edward Ditmire in a note. The largest electronic exchange in the United States said revenue rose to $447.3 million from $259.5 million in the year- ago period, driven by higher trading volume and new order fees that U.S. regulators began permitting during the quarter. Nasdaq's share of main rival New York Stock Exchange-listed trading increased to 13.9 percent in the quarter from 12.1 percent in the prior quarter and 5.7 percent during the year-ago quarter. Market share in Nasdaq-listed trading declined to 46.5 percent in the quarter from 48.7 percent during the prior quarter due to the November integration of Nasdaq's order books, wrote KBW's Herr. Higher listing fees proposed by Nasdaq during the quarter also received regulatory approval earlier this month, although the proposal had been amended to exclude services like press release dissemination by PrimeNewswire, which Nasdaq acquired in September.
