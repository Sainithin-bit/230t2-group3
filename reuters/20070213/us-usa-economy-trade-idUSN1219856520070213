 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The U.S. trade deficit widened more than expected in December and grew 6.5 percent during all of 2006 to a record $763.6 billion, a U.S. Commerce Department report showed on Tuesday. 


 The monthly trade gap totaled $61.2 billion, up 5.3 percent from November as oil prices rebounded and Americans imported record amounts of consumer goods and autos and auto parts. The December shortfall exceeded the median forecast of $59.5 billion made by Wall Street analysts surveyed before the report. It also marked the tenth time in 2006 that the monthly deficit exceeded $60 billion. Economists said the larger-than-expected December trade gap, combined with other economic data, would require the government to lower its estimate of fourth quarter U.S. economic growth. "It is probably going to take around 0.3 percent off of the revised Q4 GDP and we already anticipated a substantial negative from the inventories revision, so it seems like Q4 GDP is going to get a significant downward revision," said David Sloan, a senior economist at 4CAST Ltd. U.S. Treasury debt prices traded slightly higher after the trade data was released. The dollar lost ground, pushing the euro higher against the dollar to $1.3031  EUR=  from $1.3020, while the dollar fell against the yen to 121.21 yen  JPY=  from 121.30 just before the data. U.S. exports of goods and services, which have benefited recently from stronger foreign economic growth and a decline in the value of the dollar, totaled a record $125.5 billion in December. The same factors helped propel total exports in 2006 to a record $1.44 trillion, up 12.8 percent from the prior year. Exports grew faster than imports, which rose 10.5 percent in 2006 to $2.20 trillion. Despite setting a new record, the growth in the trade deficit slowed in 2006 from the blistering 17.3 percent pace in 2005. "The trade deficit on a real goods and nominal basis is improving," said Keith Hembre, chief economist at FAS Advisors in Minneapolis. With average prices for imported oil a record $58.00 per barrel in 2006, the United States' imports of petroleum for the year rose to a record $302.5 billion. However, the deficit in non-oil goods also was a record at $547.2 billion. The politically sensitive trade gap with China expanded 15.4 percent to a record $232.5 billion in 2006, despite record U.S. exports to that country of $55.2 billion. Imports from China surged 18.2 percent to a record $287.8 billion, ensuring that concerns about China's exchange rate and other government policies, which U.S. lawmakers and manufacturers believe unfairly aid Chinese companies, will remain a hot political topic in 2007. The United States also ran record trade deficits with Japan and Mexico in 2006.
