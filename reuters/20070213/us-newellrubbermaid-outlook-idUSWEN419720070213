 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Newell Rubbermaid Inc. ( NWL.N ) on Tuesday said charges from its current restructuring program will be more than expected, but savings from the program will also be higher than previously thought. 


 The maker of Rubbermaid storage products, Calphalon cookware and a host of other products said it now expects charges of $375 million to $400 million from the restructuring program it announced in 2005. The previous forecast was $350 million to $375 million. The company also said it now expects annual savings of $150 million, up from its previous forecast of $120 million.
