 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Liberty Media LCAPA.O reached an agreement to swap a third of its stake in Time Warner Inc. ( TWX.N ) for the Atlanta Braves baseball team, $1 billion in cash and a magazine unit, a source familiar with the matter said. 


 Time Warner declined comment. Liberty Media was not immediately reachable. The deal is subject to approval from Major League Baseball officials. Liberty will be trading 60 million of its 171 million shares in Time Warner, cutting its stake to about 2.6 percent. News of the agreement was reported in the Wall Street Journal.
