 LONDON  (Reuters) - The London Stock Exchange ( LSE.L ) may now seek alliances with other bourses, such as Tokyo, after the failure of Nasdaq Stock Market's ( NDAQ.O ) 2.7-billion-pound ($5.3 billion) hostile bid. 


 Nasdaq said on Saturday it had won just 0.41 pct of acceptances for its offer for Europe's largest share market which, combined with its existing stake of 28.75 percent, fell well short of the level of just over the 50 percent it needed to take control of the LSE. The U.S. operator, which cannot make a fresh bid for 12 months unless there is a competing offer, said it stuck by its view that its offer was fair, given the likelihood of increased competition. Now the LSE, which has fought off four takeover attempts in two years, is free to pursue other tie-ups and analysts expect the exchange to look east, or possibly seek an alliance with the soon-to-be-formed merger between Euronext ENXT.PA and NYSE Group NYX.N. An LSE spokesman said the London exchange was continuing discussions with Asia's largest stock market, the Tokyo bourse TSE.UL, over a business collaboration. "We will make an announcement upon agreement some time in the near future," the spokesman said. Tokyo Stock Exchange spokesman Toru Onoda said the two exchanges could announce an alliance, which may include joint development of financial products and mutual listing of exchange-traded funds, as early as this month. He added the LSE and TSE are not currently considering a capital tie-up. The LSE's share price in coming months hinges on how much of a threat new entrants to its current monopoly position pose to the exchange as new regulation liberalizes the market later this year. MiFID, the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive, will allow banks to become their own execution venues, competing with exchanges in trading shares, a first for most EU countries. COMPETITION FORCES ACTION Late last year a group of nine investment banks, including Citigroup Inc. (C.N), Credit Suisse Group (CSGN.VX) and Merrill Lynch & Co. (MER.N), agreed to create a rival trading platform under a plan called Project Turquoise. "The LSE looks pricey at this level and the hedge funds were greedy, hence there are almost no institutional holders. Turquoise will force them to do something probably as soon as possible," said one fund manager who declined to be named. One U.S. investor who controls over 10 percent of LSE shares, Samuel Heyman, said his investment vehicles increased their interest in the LSE to 10.63 percent, demonstrating an optimism over the bourse's future prospects. Earlier the LSE said it had made a strong start to the year, with a 61 percent rise in activity on its electronic order book. This boom in volumes, together with its ability to attract companies from around the globe to list on its exchange in an environment of benign regulation has been a lynchpin of the LSE's defense of Nasdaq's bid. LSE shares fell 0.9 percent to 1,271 pence by 1600 GMT, having touched 1,271p, but were still ahead of Nasdaq's 1,243p a share offer. "We think that there is imminent downward pressure," said analyst Johannes Thormann at West LB. "At the end, we see some 16 percent fundamental downside to our target price and are thus cutting the LSE's rating to 'reduce'," Thormann added.
