 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Stocks jumped on Tuesday as talk that aluminum maker Alcoa Inc. ( AA.N ) may be a takeover target bolstered optimism about deals and energy shares gained with a sharp rebound in oil prices. 


 The blue-chip Dow average shot up more than 100 points, while the Standard & Poor's 500 index  .SPX  achieved its biggest daily percentage gain since January 24. These advances -- and a higher finish for the Nasdaq -- followed three consecutive sessions of losses that were triggered by nervousness about rising defaults on home loans. Right after the opening bell, Wall Street got a jolt of excitement when the Nasdaq showed a surge of more than 3,000 points to a level that recalled the heady days of March 2000 just before the Internet stock bubble burst. But a Nasdaq Stock Market Inc. ( NDAQ.O ) spokesman said the spike was due to erroneous trades involving shares of Optimer Pharmaceuticals Inc. OPTR.O. The Times of London said multinational miners BHP Billiton ( BHP.AX ) ( BLT.L ) and Rio Tinto Ltd. ( RIO.AX ) ( RIO.L ) have drawn up separate plans for a $40 billion acquisition of Alcoa, whose stock is among the 30 that make up the Dow. But a source close to the matter said BHP Billiton was not working on a bid. "The market was poised for some type of a pullback rally. The Alcoa situation, although it hasn't been confirmed yet, probably aided it," said Angel Mata, managing director of listed equity trading at Stifel Nicolaus Capital Markets in Baltimore. "But it was traders and investors taking advantage of some weakening over the last few sessions." The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  climbed 102.30 points, or 0.81 percent, to end at 12,654.85. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  shot up 10.89 points, or 0.76 percent, to finish at 1,444.26. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  rose 9.50 points, or 0.39 percent, to close at 2,459.88. Alcoa shares climbed 6.4 percent, or $2.10, to close at $35 on the New York Stock Exchange, recording their biggest percentage gain since November 2002. Alcoa contributed the most to the Dow's advance. After the closing bell, shares of Applied Materials Inc. ( AMAT.O ), the world's largest supplier of equipment for making microchips, rose 4.5 percent to $19 in electronic trade as the company's quarterly profit topped estimates.

Investors hope to get some hint about how he sees the outlook for U.S. interest rates in the months ahead after recent data showing the economy is strong. EXXON RISES AND APPLEBEE'S JUMPS During Tuesday's regular trade, U.S. crude oil futures prices rose more than $1 a barrel CLc1, helped by an International Energy Agency report raising its forecast for growth in 2007 world oil demand. The gains followed a drop in crude oil futures prices of more than $2 on Monday. Exxon Mobil Corp. ( XOM.N ) topped the S&P 500's list of major gainers and also ranked among the biggest positive influences on the Dow. Exxon's stock gained 1.1 percent, or 85 cents, to $75.45 on the NYSE. Crude for March delivery CLH7 rose 2.2 percent, or $1.25, to settle at $59.06 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. In other merger talk, Applebee's International Inc. APPB.O shot up 8.6 percent, or $2.09, to $26.32 after the restaurant chain said it is exploring strategic alternatives, including the possible sale of the company. Earlier in the session, Applebee's stock climbed as high as $27.32, its highest price since June 2005. BETTER DAY FOR BANKERS AND BUILDERS Shares of mortgage bankers, home builders and real estate investment trusts rebounded after three days of losses. Last Thursday, Britain's HSBC Holdings Inc. ( HSBA.L )HBC.N and U.S.-based New Century Financial Corp. NEW.N disclosed mounting losses from defaults on U.S. mortgages. The MSCI U.S. REIT Index .RMZ2 rose 1.8 percent, while the S&P index of financial companies and banks .GSPF rose 0.9 percent. "You saw a dramatic turnaround in REITs after being pummeled over the last few days," Mata said. "People are afraid that they're missing the bottom." Adding to the positive tone, Merrill Lynch lifted its rating on shares of General Motors Corp. ( GM.N ) and diversified manufacturer 3M Co. ( MMM.N ) announced a $7 billion share buyback. 3M shares jumped 2.5 percent, or $1.84, to $76.43. GM's stock rose 2.5 percent, or 88 cents, to $36.59. But shares of Nasdaq, the U.S. exchange operator, fell 11.4 percent, or $4, to $31.10 after it issued a disappointing 2007 earnings forecast. Trading was moderate on the NYSE, where about 1.46 billion shares changed hands, below last year's estimated average daily volume of 1.84 billion. On the Nasdaq, about 1.91 billion shares traded, below last year's average daily volume of 2.02 billion. Advancers outnumbered decliners on the Big Board by a ratio of 8 to 3, while on Nasdaq, three stocks rose for every two that fell.
