 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Applied Materials Inc. ( AMAT.O ), the top supplier of equipment for making microchips, on Tuesday said first-quarter profit nearly tripled and that second-quarter revenue could rise as much as 5 percent, sending its shares up 4.5 percent. 


 The profit topped analysts' forecasts, despite revenue that was weaker than expected, and the company's anticipation of persistent strength in memory chip demand and a rebound later this year in the flat-panel display market helped allay two recent concerns of investors. "Memory orders were strong," Chief Executive Mike Splinter told a conference call. "We expect the overall memory business to remain relatively strong and balanced over the year." The company expects to earn 27 cents, or 28 cents per share, in the second quarter, with revenue staying flat or rising as much as 5 percent from the first quarter, Chief Financial Officer George Davis said. That would put sales at $2.28 billion to $2.39 billion. Analysts, on average, had been looking for a profit of 27 cents on revenue of $2.35 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. Applied Materials said net profit for its first fiscal quarter ended January 28 was $403.5 million, or 29 cents per share, compared with $142.8 million, or 9 cents per share, a year earlier. Analysts expected Applied Materials to earn 27 cents per share. Revenue was $2.28 billion, up 23 percent from a year earlier, but lower than the $2.35 billion expected by analysts. The lower revenue pushed gross margin down to 46.7 percent from 47.1 percent, the company said. New orders were up nearly a quarter from a year earlier, but down 6 percent from the previous quarter, driven by a 22 percent drop in orders for flat-panel equipment, Davis said. Applied Materials shares rose 4.2 percent to $18.92 in extended trading on the Nasdaq after the outlook was given. The stock, which closed up 1.9 percent at $18.18 on Nasdaq, has fallen almost 9 percent over the past year. That compares with a rise of 25 percent in Netherlands- based ASM International NV ( ASMI.O ), a gain of 11 percent in Novellus Systems Inc. NVLS.O and a fall of 5 percent for Lam Research Corp. ( LRCX.O ). Splinter expected orders from flat-panel makers to rise slightly in the second quarter, while contract chipmakers -- also known as foundries -- would start spending again in the third quarter after a protracted period of belt-tightening. "The foundries ... continue to hold back on capital investment and are very much at the bottom of the trough," Splinter said. Orders at U.S. chip equipment suppliers have fallen steadily since the middle of 2007 as chip makers ease back on capacity additions amid concerns of an inventory glut and a bubble in memory chips. Industry data released last month showed new orders at U.S. equipment suppliers totaled $1.52 billion in December, up from $1.45 billion in November, but down almost 15 percent from the level in June. The industry was also spooked last month when Lam Research, which specializes in equipment to etch circuitry, gave forecasts that fell short of Wall Street expectations and sparked a sell-off in the sector.
