 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Ceridian Corp., ( CEN.N ) a human resources outsourcing company recently criticized by an activist investor, said on Tuesday that fourth-quarter profit rose, helped by declining research and development expenditure. 


 Pershing Square Capital Management LP, an activist investor, last month said it was looking to add eight of its candidates to the company's board. The asset manager said Ceridian had underperformed its potential. Ceridian said last month that it had hired an adviser to help it consider strategic alternatives, including spinning off its Comdata unit. On Tuesday, the company named the advisor--Greenhill & Co. ( GHL.N )--and said it was looking at a broad range of alternatives. Ceridian said quarterly profit rose to $49.6 million, or 35 cents a share, from $46.7 million, or 32 cents a share, a year earlier. Analysts had on average expected results before special items of 33 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates.
