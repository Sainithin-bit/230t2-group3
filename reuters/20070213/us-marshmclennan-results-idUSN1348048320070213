 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Marsh & McLennan Cos. Inc.( MMC.N ), the world's largest insurance brokerage company, said on Tuesday that fourth-quarter earnings soared, helped by growth in its consulting businesses. 


 While Marsh's earnings grew in its consulting and risk management units, its underlying brokerage business is still being hit with "head winds," according to Marsh Chief Financial Officer Matt Bartley. "We're seeing this market softening without any signal of a hardening to come," Bartley said. A broker negotiates insurance contracts for business clients, and prices there have been falling. Analysts expect commercial insurance premiums to decline about 5 percent this year. Marsh said net income for the latest quarter was $226 million, or 40 cents a share, compared with $35 million, or 6 cents a share a year before. Earnings from continuing operations were 39 cents a share. Analysts had expected the New York City-based broker and risk consultant to earn 37 cents a share, excluding items. Consolidated revenue for the fourth quarter was $3.1 billion, up 9 percent from the year-earlier level. Analysts had expected $2.93 billion. Particularly strong were consulting revenues, which rose 15 percent to $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter. Mercer Specialty Consulting, which competes with McKinsey and other firms, saw revenue jump 23 percent. Chief Executive Michael Cherkasky told investors his three- year projection is for revenue growth of 5 percent a year and earnings growth from continuing operations in the "mid-teens." SHARES FALL Despite this, Marsh's shares were down modestly in early afternoon trading, losing 43 cents or 1.4 percent to $29.40 a share on the New York Stock Exchange. In the last 12 months, the stock has declined about 4 percent. "It will take a while for people to digest this," Cherkasky told Reuters. Cherkasky said he was convinced that all of Marsh's units -- brokerage, risk consulting, and human resources -- had rebounded last year from 2005, guided by a strategy of offering client companies the whole range of Marsh's services. Net income more than doubled to $990 million in 2006. Some analysts agreed. "The company has turned the corner from defense to offense," said Alain Karaoglan of Deutsche Bank in a report. But others were less certain. "The bleeding has stopped, but this is not exactly a growth story," said Donald Light with Celent LLC. Cherkasky said Marsh is sitting on a cash hoard, ending 2006 with $2 billion. While $1 billion will be used in the first quarter, when compensation costs are heavy, the broker expects to net another $2.5 billion in cash from its sale of its Putnam asset management unit by mid-year. Cherkasky said his first priority would be to make acquisitions that would help Marsh's current businesses and would add to earnings quickly, which he defined as possibly within 18 months. ACQUISITION COULD BE BIG "Size is not a restricter on what we could do," Cherkasky told Reuters. He had previously said that his priorities would be the company's Kroll unit, which handles risk consulting, and in its Mercer Human Resource Consulting business. Both Kroll and Mercer reported revenue growth of 12 percent for the fourth quarter. Marsh itself was seen as a takeover target by competitor Willis Group Holdings Ltd. ( WSH.N ) in August, when Marsh's stock bottomed out at $24.20 a share. But as Marsh had reported several quarters of improved earnings and agreed to sell Putnam, analysts such as Karaoglan now have a "buy" recommendation on the stock. In January, Marsh agreed to sell Putnam for $3.9 billion to the Great-West Lifeco Inc. ( GWO.TO ) affiliate of Power Financial Corp. ( PWF.TO ). The mutual fund and asset manager had been plagued by outflows from its funds and legal problems and no longer fit with Cherkasky's strategy.
