 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - A $1.3 billion small-business tax cut package aimed at winning the first minimum wage increase in more than a decade advanced in the U.S. House of Representatives on Monday. 


 The tax-writing Ways and Means Committee by voice vote approved the bill that congressional leaders say is needed to win Republican support for raising the minimum wage to $7.25 per hour over two years from $5.15 per hour. Democrats are anxious to deliver on a key campaign promise and the House is expected to vote on the bill as early as Tuesday. The closely divided Senate earlier this month agreed to the wage increase only after adding some $8.3 billion in small-business tax cuts. Rep. Jim McCrery of Louisiana, the top Republican on the Ways and Means Committee, said he had concerns about some of the revenue-raising provisions in the larger Senate bill, particularly a measure that would limit deferred compensation plans for corporate executives. But Sen. Charles Grassley of Iowa, the Senate Finance Committee's top Republican, said he was confident the two chambers could reach agreement and send a minimum wage increase to President George W. Bush for his signature. The House bill would extend tax breaks that encourage hiring of veterans, the handicapped and high-risk youths through 2008. The bill would also extend provisions allowing small businesses to immediately write off up to $125,000 of investment in equipment through 2010 and provide some alternative minimum tax relief for businesses. The $1.3 billion 10 year cost of the tax cuts would be offset by changing capital gains and dividend tax rules for dependents under 24 and by making a one-year adjustment in estimated tax payments for large corporations.
