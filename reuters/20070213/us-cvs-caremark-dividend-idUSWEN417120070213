 NEW YORK/CHICAGO  (Reuters) - CVS Corp. ( CVS.N ) sweetened its bid for Caremark Rx Inc. CMX.N on Tuesday by tripling a proposed special cash dividend for the pharmacy benefit manager's stockholders to $6 per share, after proxy advisory firms urged rejection of the previous offer. 


 But even with the raised dividend, the new offer from drugstore chain CVS falls below a hostile bid for Caremark from rival benefit manager Express Scripts Inc. ( ESRX.O ). Express Scripts also was expected to boost its bid even further, a source familiar with the situation said. The terms and timing of a new bid were unclear. CVS has offered to pay $23.4 billion, or $53.59 per share, in stock plus the $6-per-share cash dividend. St. Louis-based Express Scripts' cash-and-stock offer valued Caremark at $26.8 billion, or $61.37 per share. Both offers still fall below Caremark's current stock price, which closed at $62.88, up $1.97, or 3.23 percent on the New York Stock Exchange. "We believe that (Caremark) shareholders would be likely to support the CVS merger," said Wachovia Securities analyst Matt Perry. "The increased value to (Caremark) from the CVS merger puts some pressure on (Express Scripts) to raise it offer." Although CVS sweetened its offer, it lost some ground on Tuesday after the Delaware Chancery Court ordered that the Caremark shareholder vote be delayed until at least March 9 to give investors more time to consider the revised terms. Caremark's shareholders had been originally scheduled to vote on the CVS deal on February 20, while CVS shareholders were scheduled to vote on February 23. CVS had argued that its deal would give Caremark a faster, more guaranteed payout since its proposal had already passed regulatory review and could close shortly after the shareholder votes. The offer from Express Scripts, meanwhile, still faces regulatory review and would be unlikely to close until the third quarter of 2007. Both Caremark and CVS said they would postpone their meetings, but new dates had not been set. Although the meetings would be delayed only a few weeks, Express Scripts gained more time to lobby shareholders on their offer, analysts said. "CVS took one step forward and one step back today," said one arbitrager, who declined to be named. Express Scripts extended the expiration date of its hostile offer until March 16, instead of February 13 as planned. MORE ROUNDS TO GO? Analysts said they expect both suitors to raise their bids further before the Caremark takeover battle ends. Despite facing a federal investigation of stock-option grants for employees, Caremark has become a coveted asset. CVS wants to acquire Caremark in order to expand its prescription benefits and mail-order business. Express Scripts, meanwhile, wants to buy its larger rival to create the world's largest pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) and gain greater market power to demand lower prices from drug manufacturers. "CVS has a big hurdle because on the face of it, the Express Scripts deal is easier to understand," said Morningstar analyst Mitchell Corwin. "It's harder with CVS because you have two companies in two different industries merging. When you're talking about two PBMs getting together, it's easy, it's scale." Corwin said. CVS's decision to increase the dividend came one day after an influential proxy advisory firm, Institutional Shareholder Services, urged Caremark shareholders to reject the CVS takeover, following similar comments last week by another advisory firm, Glass Lewis. Both firms slammed Caremark for failing to open talks with more suitors. The ISS report carries weight because some mutual funds are required under their by-laws to follow ISS recommendations. WILL EXPRESS SCRIPTS COUNTER? Wachovia's Perry said Express Scripts could raise its offer to a range of $65-$66 per share and still have the deal boost earnings in 2009. Jefferies & Co. analyst Arthur Henderson said Express Scripts may raise the cash portion of its offer to around $32 per share, from $29.25 currently, raising the total offer to about $64 per share. Henderson said he believed Caremark becomes fully valued at about $65 per share. "If things get up beyond that, I think Express Scripts walks away," Henderson said. Adding more cash, however, would require Express Scripts to take on more debt and could force them to renegotiate their financing agreements with their lenders, other analysts said.
