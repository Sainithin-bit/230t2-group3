 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - MetLife Inc. ( MET.N ), the largest life insurance company in the United States, said on Tuesday that fourth quarter earnings rose fivefold from a year ago on gains from the sale of its New York apartment complexes and higher revenues. 


 MetLife, a full-service insurer based in New York City and, until recently, one of its biggest property owners, said fourth quarter net income was $3.83 billion, or $4.95 a share. A year ago, MetLife reported earnings of $677 million, or 88 cents a share. Operating earnings for MetLife, which provides auto, homeowners and disability coverage in addition to life, were $1.05 billion, or $1.36 a share. Analysts had expected operating earnings, which exclude investment gains and losses, to be $1.18 a share, according to Reuters Estimates. In the year ago fourth quarter, the insurance giant reported operating income of $799 million, or $1.04 a share. In aftermarket trading, MetLife shares rose to $65.10 from their close on the New York Stock Exchange at $64.85. In the past 12 months, its shares have risen more than 27 percent, compared with a 10.8 percent gain in the Standard & Poor's Insurance Index .GSPINSC. The biggest boost to net earnings was an after-tax gain of $3 billion on MetLife's sale in November of Peter Cooper Village and Stuyvesant Town, two of the largest apartment complexes in Manhattan. But MetLife also said total premiums, fees and other revenues rose to $8.6 billion in the latest quarter, up 10 percent year over year. Several of the insurer's units reported record earnings, including its individual business unit, where total life earnings almost doubled year over year due to favorable mortality statistics and higher investment income. Also hitting a record was MetLife's smaller auto and home earnings, which rose 42 percent to $115 million. Institutional business, MetLife's largest unit, saw operating earnings rise 13 percent to $441 million.
