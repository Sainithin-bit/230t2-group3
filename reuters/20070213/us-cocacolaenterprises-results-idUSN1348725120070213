 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc. ( CCE.N ) said on Tuesday it took a $2.9 billion impairment charge in 2006, and the largest bottler of Coca-Cola ( KO.N ) drinks plans to cut about 3,500 jobs, or 5 percent of its global work force. 


 CCE said it faces unprecedented cost of goods increases in North America in 2007, primarily for the aluminum used for cans and for high fructose corn syrup, which is used as a sweetener in many soft drinks. Soaring demand from the ethanol industry is sapping U.S. corn supplies, keeping prices near 10-year highs. "There has been a fundamental change in the sweetener market driven by corn, ultimately driven by the corn used in ethanol," Chief Financial Officer William Douglas said during a conference call. He said that he does not expect to see ethanol prices retreating in the near future. The company also posted a fourth-quarter net loss and said it expected profit to fall this year. Excluding items, its fourth-quarter results topped Wall Street's expectations. The restructuring is a long-term positive and CCE's new long-term targets are sound, Stifel Nicolaus analyst Mark Swartzberg said in a research note. Shares of CCE rose 2.6 percent before paring some of those gains. JOB CUTS CCE said that it plans to take the majority of about $300 million in separate restructuring charges during 2007 and 2008. It is restructuring parts of its corporate, North American and European operations. Most of the job cuts will come from North America, the company said. Morgan Stanley analyst Bill Pecoriello said that the amount of job cuts was "somewhat larger" than he had expected. Pecoriello and other industry watchers had said last month that CCE would likely announce job cuts on Tuesday. Atlanta-based CCE said that it took the impairment charge to reduce the book value of its North American franchise license intangibles to their estimated fair value. The charge relates to goodwill with a number of acquisitions completed more than 10 years ago. When CCE did those deals, it projected business based on carbonated soft drink growth of 2 percent to 5 percent. But in the past few years, that growth has been about flat as consumers have turned to other selections, including bottled water and sports drinks. The slowing trend, compounded with the cost of goods the company faces, means that the book value of those assets is worth less today then they were when the acquisitions were done. "What we're looking to Coca-Cola for is a significantly broadened portfolio in the (noncarbonated) area," Chief Executive John Brock said during the conference call. "We're disadvantaged versus our competitor and we need some major activity." Pepsi Bottling Group Inc. PBG.N, the largest bottler of PepsiCo Inc. ( PEP.N ) drinks, posted an 80 percent rise in quarterly profit last month, helped by a lower tax rate, and said it was also facing unprecedented cost increases. Still, that company has a string of new noncarbonated beverages, such as vitamin-enhanced Aquafina water and SoBe juice drinks, to attract consumers not interested in soda. CONSERVATIVE OUTLOOK CCE, which is about 35 percent owned by Coca-Cola Co., said that it expects North American cost of sales to be up about 9 percent per case this year, compared to an average increase of 2.5 percent over the past five years. The company said it aims to offset some of those higher costs by raising some prices in North America. Due to the "extraordinary" cost environment, CCE expects 2007 earnings per share to be down 5 percent to 10 percent from comparable 2006 earnings of $1.30 per share. Analysts, on average, expected the company to earn $1.25 a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Starting with 2008, the company expects long-term annual revenue growth of 4 percent to 5 percent and earnings per share growth in the high-single digit percentage range. CCE posted a fourth-quarter net loss of $1.71 billion, or $3.59 per share, compared to a loss of $57 million, or 12 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, CCE earned 20 cents per share in the quarter, topping analysts' average forecast of 16 cents and a profit of 14 cents per share a year earlier. Revenue rose nearly 6.5 percent to $4.79 billion, topping analysts' average forecast of $4.65 billion. Cost of sales per case increased 7 percent. In the key North American market, volume fell 2.5 percent, hurt by price increases. Net pricing per case grew 3 percent. (With reporting by Jessica Wohl in Chicago)
