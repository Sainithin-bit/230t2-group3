 LONDON  (Reuters) - Commodity trader Glencore has priced its bumper $11 billion market debut in the middle of its initial range, balancing appetite for its shares with concerns from some investors over valuation, sources close to the deal said. 

 The final decision to price at 530 pence per share was in line with earlier market expectations. At that price -- the exact midpoint of Glencore's GLEN.UL original 480 to 580 pence range, but just below the middle of narrower guidance issued earlier this week -- the world's largest diversified commodities trader will be worth 36.5 billion pounds ($59 billion). "The price seems to have struck a nice balance between where accounts were prepared to move to and where the company was happy to sell," one of the sources said. Glencore, which is also listing in Hong Kong, is in the final stage of the potentially record-breaking initial public offering of what would be a 16.4 percent stake, assuming no overallotment and no conversion of its convertible bonds. Dozens of its advisers and bankers worked through the night and into Wednesday on the complex process of allocating the shares after books closed on Tuesday, a day early. Final discussions on the price took place on Wednesday and the decision will be announced to the market on Thursday, before conditional trading in the shares begins in London. With a 10 percent overallotment option likely to take the total size of Glencore's offering to $11 billion, it is set to be London's largest-ever listing, overtaking Russia's Rosneft, which raised $10.6 billion in 2006. Its market value will also propel the commodities trader straight into London's FTSE-100 index of bluechip shares. CONDITIONAL TRADING Glencore has said there is strong demand for its stock and it had enough buyers to cover its offer within hours of starting the sale process earlier this month. It had enough several times over by Tuesday evening, with the book eventually more than four times covered, one of the sources said. The trader has said demand was not rattled by the sell-off in commodities, which it dismissed last week as "froth." Several top fund managers, however, have said much of the appetite has come from tracker funds that will have to buy into the trader once it is in the FTSE index. Cornerstone investors have also already signed up to buy almost a third of the shares. Fund mangers told Glencore this week to set a price around the midpoint or face a drop in value in its first weeks as a listed company. The group's top executives and cornerstone investors are tied in through lock-ups of at least six months, but share performance will matter to Glencore, particularly if the company is to use the offering as planned to pursue acquisitions, not least any potential offer for peer Xstrata XTA.L. Sources close to the matter, however, said on Tuesday that investors were being told to place orders at or above 530 pence to ensure they are allocated stock. Starting at 530p -- also the final price penciled in by spread betters -- Glencore is expected to track higher in grey market or conditional trade. BGC Partners earlier indicated an opening level of 545 to 552 pence per share. Glencore, which will trade as GLEN.L, has consistently declined to comment on the pricing process. Founded in 1974 by trading sensation Marc Rich, Glencore has until now held on to a tradition of discretion. Its publicity-shy top executives, however, will become paper millionaires with the initial public offering, with Chief Executive Ivan Glasenberg's stake worth $10 billion. Glasenberg and other existing shareholders will control about 80 percent of the company after listing. Citigroup ( C.N ), Credit Suisse ( CSGN.VX ) and Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ) are the joint global coordinators for the offer, joined by another 20 banks in lower ranking syndicate roles.
