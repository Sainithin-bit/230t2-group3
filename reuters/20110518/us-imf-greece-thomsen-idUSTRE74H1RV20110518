 ATHENS  (Reuters) - Greece's high borrowing costs may stay high into 2012 before narrowing as markets' trust in the country's reforms and the EU crisis response mechanism grows, the IMF's chief of mission to the debt-laden country said on Wednesday. 

 "I do believe that with the subsequent acceleration (of reforms) and now with the clarity of the European response mechanism, spreads will start coming down significantly but I think that this might not happen by next year." He said Greece's high yield spreads reflected developments outside the country and that they were coming down until talk of debt restructuring by some EU leaders unsettled markets.
