 SKOLKOVO, Russia  (Reuters) - BP ( BP.L ) and Rosneft ( ROSN.MM ) should have paid closer attention to the terms of a shareholder agreement governing BP's Russian venture that caused a strategic deal to fall apart, President Dmitry Medvedev said. 

 "Those who prepared the deal should have paid closer attention to the nuances of the shareholder agreement," Medvedev told a news conference on Wednesday. "It would have been necessary to conduct more careful due diligence inside the government," Medvedev added, indirectly criticizing Deputy Prime Minister Igor Sechin, who masterminded the deal on the Russian side.
