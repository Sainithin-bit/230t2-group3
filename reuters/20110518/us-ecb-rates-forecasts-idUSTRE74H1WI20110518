 MILAN  (Reuters) - The European Central Bank (ECB) will decide whether to raise interest rates next month only after examining forecasts and price pressures, ECB Executive Board member Lorenzo Bini Smaghi said on Wednesday. 

 "We decide on a month by month basis. Next month we will see what the forecasts and upwards pressures on prices are," Bini Smaghi said when asked about a possible interest rate increase next month. He spoke to reporters on the sidelines of a conference. (Reporting by Francesca Landini, writing by Ian Simpson)
