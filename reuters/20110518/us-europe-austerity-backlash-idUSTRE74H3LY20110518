 LONDON  (Reuters) - Europeans angry at austerity are largely showing it at the ballot box rather than on the streets, delivering a string of local poll rebukes to those in power and favoring more unconventional parties. 

 Recent elections across Europe have suggested a backlash against painful economic measures and a rise in Eurosceptic groups, leading some to fear the continent's leaders are becoming dangerously out of touch with what their people want. That raises fears that even if countries avoid widescale social unrest, they may simply be unable to deliver essential reforms to tackle their debts. "There is significant and growing political risk in Europe," said Charles Robertson, chief economist of Russian bank Renaissance Capital. "The gap between voters and the ruling elite is probably as wide as it has ever been. The political risk attached to the euro has probably risen to a record level and is only likely to increase." Europe's streets have not been entirely quiet. Students and other youths hit the streets in December and March to protest against hikes in tuition fees in some of Britain's worst violence in two decades. Greeks renewed protests and strike action last week. The unrest has been much more limited than many expected, however, with nothing on the scale of last May's Athens riots. "There seems a mood of resignation when it comes to protest," said David Lea, Western Europe political analyst at Control Risks. "But it's not apathy, because people are voting and looking for targets to give a real kicking to." POLITICAL SETBACKS Chancellor Angela Merkel's party was savaged in state elections in March, Britain's junior coalition partner Liberal Democrats were battered in local polls and a referendum on their keystone electoral reform policy in May. Ireland's Fianna Fail, one of Europe's longest serving ruling parties, was swept from power in February general elections. Supporters of Italy's Silvio Berlusconi this week suffered defeats in local elections -- a move analysts said would bring greater instability and uncertainty -- and Spain's ruling Socialists are also expected to suffer in weekend local polls. The discontent with established political parties looks to be good news for less mainstream parties with more unconventional policies -- Finland's April elections delivered a much stronger than expected result for the Eurosceptic True Finns, who are opposed to any further Eurozone bailouts. In France, anti-euro right wing leader Marine Le Pen is expected to come a strong third in 2012's presidential vote, her position bolstered further  by the dramatic implosion of likely Socialist challenger Dominique Strauss Kahn. WEAK COALITION GOVERNMENTS Adding to the uncertainty is the fact that so many European countries are now ruled by coalition governments, making pushing through difficult policies increasingly challenging. Portugal, for example, faces snap elections after failing to pass a budget, although all major parties have now signed up to a new austerity package after the country was forced to seek its own bailout. Analysts worry that kind of political crisis will only become more common in the years ahead. "France and Greece are the only two one-party majority governments left in Europe," said Control Risks' Lea. "And in countries with coalitions, it's getting harder and harder to push through meaningful policies. Even the UK coalition -- which looked promising at the beginning -- is beginning to fray at the edges." More than two years into the Eurozone debt crisis, there are few signs that it is being brought under control. Europe's top officials for the first time this week acknowledged the continent's most troubled economy Greece might have had to restructure some of its debt, most likely meaning bondholders would have to except late payment. But most analysts believe other countries will avoid such action and expect the single currency to survive -- but not without a few occasional scares for markets. "We believe that ultimately Europe will stick to its chosen course but in the meantime persistent uncertainties could further unsettle bond market in particular," Nomura political analyst Alastair Newton wrote. Perhaps, those who favor emerging markets argue, in the aftermath of the economic crisis the perceived strength of developed economies -- their relative stability versus poorer countries -- will prove their Achilles heel. "Stability can also lead to inflexibility, an inability to adapt," said emerging markets fund Ashmore in a research note, arguing policy paralysis might only get worse. "The risk is that... political myopia becomes a greater constraint on economic policy...As job losses build so will political pressure in favor of economic short-sightedness."
