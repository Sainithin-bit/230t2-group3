 (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve policymakers discussed how to eventually normalize the stance of monetary policy at their April meeting. 

 Minutes of the meeting released on Wednesday showed that while they did not make any decisions on their strategy for normalizing policy, the did agree on principles to guide it. The minutes also gave a flavor of the state of play on how officials are viewing the likely sequencing of their exit. GUIDING PRINCIPLES: -- The goals of maximum employment and price stability would guide the policy normalization. -- The aim would be to return to a regime whereby the federal funds rate would be the main tool, rather than asset sales. -- Another aim would be to eventually return to holding only Treasury securities on the Fed's balance sheet in order to minimize the extent to which the Fed affects the allocation of credit across specific sectors of the economy. -- Asset sales would be implemented within a framework communicated in advance, though the balance sheet could still be adjusted to respond to changes in economic or financial conditions as needed. REINVESTMENTS: -- Nearly all participants indicated that the first step toward normalization would be stopping reinvestments of agency securities and, simultaneously or soon after, ceasing reinvestments of Treasuries. ASSET SALES -- Most participants felt that once asset sales became appropriate, they should be done on a largely predetermined and preannounced path, although many of those said sales could still be adjusted as needed. -- Several other participants preferred the pace of sales to be a key policy tool and varied actively. -- Most preferred sales of mortgage agency securities come after the first increase in the target for short-term rates, and many wanted sales to proceed "relatively gradually" to return the balance sheet to all Treasuries over perhaps five years. Later and more-gradual sales would allow for an earlier increase of the federal funds rate, participants noted. -- A few participants said they would prefer asset sales before rate hikes. A few others said sales and rate hikes could be done at the same time. Some suggested the balance sheet could then be returned to Treasuries only in one to two years. INTEREST ON RESERVES AND RESERVE DRAINING TOOLS -- A number of participants said using temporary reserve draining tools before the first rate hike would be advisable, to assess the effectiveness of the draining tools and judge the size of draining operations necessary to support changes in the interest on excess reserves rate in implementing a desired increase in short-term rates. -- A number of participants said they'd be willing to sell assets sooner if the temporary reserves-draining operations and the end of reinvestment of principal payments were not sufficient to support a fairly tight link between increases in the excess reserves rate and short-term market interest rates. LONGER-RUN MONETARY FRAMEWORK -- Some participants noted their preferences about the longer-run framework for implementing monetary policy. Of these, many said they'd prefer monetary policy to eventually operate through a corridor-style system. In such a system, the interest on excess reserve rate would be the floor and the discount rate the ceiling of the range. (Reuters Fed reporting team)
