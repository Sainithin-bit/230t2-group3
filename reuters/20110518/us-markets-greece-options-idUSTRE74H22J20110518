 LONDON  (Reuters) - Greece is likely to remain locked out of capital markets in 2012 and unable to finance a 26.7 billion euros ($38 billion) funding shortfall, fuelling debate over what steps policymakers could take to avoid a default. 

 Following are some of the options that financial market participants or European policymakers have said could be deployed to help Greece meet its funding needs. FRESH BAILOUT LOANS Greece receives additional EU/IMF funding to plug the 26.7 billion euros gap in its finances projected for 2012. EU officials have indicated any additional loans to Greece would only come if faster progress was made to bring the country's huge public debt back under control so any disbursement would probably be some months away. Key Variables - Conditionality: Greece is already failing to meet the targets for reduced spending and increased tax revenues laid out last year. Market participants have expressed concern that even tougher conditions could crimp any prospect of economic growth further and worsen the country's already dire fiscal position. VOLUNTARY CHANGES TO TERMS OF EXISTING DEBT Holders of Greek debt are asked to voluntarily exchange their existing bonds for new ones with longer repayment terms, a process which has variously been referred to as a debt maturity extension, a reprofiling or a soft restructuring. Typically, bonds expiring in the near future are swapped for new debt that is repaid further down the line, with the aim of extending the maturity of Greece's debt to give it more time to resolve its financial problems. In order to encourage bondholders to participate in the exchange, new bonds could be offered with adjusted coupons to leave the net present value of the obligation intact, and could even carry more attractive terms. For example, new bonds might incorporate growth targets so that if Greece achieved a set GDP growth rate over a fixed time, the bonds would pay a higher coupon, one senior EU official has suggested. The threat of a tougher restructuring further down the line should they not agree, could also bring Greece's creditors on board. It is unclear whether a voluntary debt exchange would trigger Credit Default Swaps (CDS) -- a financial instrument that pays out in the event of a default -- something which EU leaders have said they are determined to avoid. Key variables - Credit enhancements: The larger the debt extension and the more bonds affected, the more attractive the terms offered on the new debt will have to be in order to ensure sufficient bondholder participation. - Maturities affected: The number of bonds involved in the exchange will determine how large the overall effect on the Greek debt maturity profile will be. - Scale of extension: The longer investors are asked to defer repayment of their investment the more time Greece has to address its fiscal imbalances. IMPOSED CHANGES TO TERMS OF EXISTING DEBT Greece decides without the consent of bondholders that it will no longer repay its outstanding debt at face value, reduce the rate of interest paid on the bonds or delay repayments. This would be classed as a default by major credit rating agencies. A forced restructuring would immediately cut the country's debt burden but would impose losses on bondholders which could potentially spark a fresh crisis in the euro zone banking system, market analysts and ECB officials say. Policymakers have strongly resisted any talk of forced debt restructuring. Greece is in no position to cope with a default because it is not running a primary budget surplus and is still deep in recession, so could not pay its bills without credit, from which it would be shut out for years. Key variables: - Size of haircut: A cut in the face value of Greek bonds is referred to as a haircut. The larger the haircut, the greater the losses for debtholders. - Coupon cuts: A reduction on bond coupon payments would affect the value of the debt, forcing financial institutions to writedown the value of their current holdings. BACKGROUND Greece agreed a 110 billion euro financial rescue package in May 2010 with the European Union and International Monetary Fund to help the country overcome its huge debt burden. The original terms of this package projected Greece would be able to resume raising fund from the market in 2012, raising a total of 26.7 billion euros. However, market participant see little chance of a return to debt markets in 2012, with some saying it may take several years before it can persuade investors to buy its bonds.
