 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - The euro zone needs to provide for private sector investors to participate in the resolution of sovereign debt crises," German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said on Wednesday. 

 "All euro zone governments need not only convincingly to demonstrate their commitment to fiscal consolidation, but also to increasing competitiveness, to restore confidence of markets as well as of citizens," Schaeuble said in a speech to the Brussels Economic Forum. "But it's not only countries that need incentives to restore competitiveness or to borrow responsibly," he said, adding: "Investors too, need incentives to lend responsibly. That's why we must provide for private sector participation in the resolution of sovereign debt crises." (Reporting by  Annika Breidthardt ; Editing by  Rex Merrifield )
