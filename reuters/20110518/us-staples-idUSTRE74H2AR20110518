 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Staples Inc ( SPLS.O ) reported much lower-than-expected quarterly earnings and slashed its full-year forecast, sending shares in the world's largest office supplies retailer down the most in a day in 11 years and renewing talk of consolidation. 

 The company also said it would make a net addition of 20 new stores in North America, less than the 40 it had planned. Smaller rivals Office Depot Inc ( ODP.N ) and OfficeMax Inc OMX.N posted weak quarterly sales last month as corporate customers and shoppers spent less on office supplies. Staples' results on Wednesday sent the company's shares to their lowest level in two years and dragged down Office Depot and OfficeMax shares. "We had been holding out hope that their results would show market share gains from their two weaker competitors, but the very small share gain is coming at high costs," Credit Suisse analyst Gary Balter said. "Three players are at least one too many in this sector," Balter said. "Consolidation will be a necessity." Office supply stores may find themselves beset by the same problems as newspapers and bookstores as people shop more at online retailers such as Amazon.com ( AMZN.O ) or independent dealers. Nomura analyst Aram Rubinson downgraded Staples earlier this month despite his belief that the chain is "run by some of the best retail executives around." He said the office supply business is fighting a "battle for relevance." In addition to a decision to open fewer stores, Staples is "trimming significant square footage" from its 18,000-square-foot format, CEO Ron Sargent said. TOUGH TIMES AHEAD The company, which expects little improvement in the U.S. economy this year, forecast full-year net earnings of $1.35 to $1.45 a share, down from its earlier view of $1.50 to $1.60. It forecast sales growth at a low single-digit percentage rate, compared with its earlier outlook for an increase in the low to mid-single digits. Staples' net profit rose to $198.2 million, or 28 cents a share, in the first quarter ended on April 30, from $188.8 million, or 26 cents a share, a year earlier. Analysts were expecting 32 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Sales rose 2 percent to $6.17 billion, missing the average analyst estimate of $6.2 billion. Staples shares were down 15.5 percent at $16.61 on Nasdaq after touching a low of $16.43. On the New York Stock Exchange, Office Depot fell 6.6 percent and OfficeMax fell 7.7 percent.
