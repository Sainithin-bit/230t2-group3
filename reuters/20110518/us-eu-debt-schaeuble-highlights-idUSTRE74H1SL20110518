 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said on Wednesday private sector investors need to participate in resolving sovereign debt crises. 

 Following are highlights of his comments in a speech to the Brussels Economic Forum. ON PRIVATE INVESTOR PARTICIPATION IN DEBT-CRISIS RESOLUTION: "All euro zone governments need not only convincingly to demonstrate their commitment to fiscal consolidation, but also to increasing competitiveness, to restore confidence of markets as well as of citizens," Schaeuble said in a speech to the Brussels Economic Forum. "But it's not only countries that need incentives to restore competitiveness or to borrow responsibly," he said, adding: "Investors too, need incentives to lend responsibly. That's why we must provide for private sector participation in the resolution of sovereign debt crises." ON EUROPEAN STABILITY MECHANISM (ESM) AND RISK AND REWARD: "The ESM will provide for private sector involvement. This is of very high priority for the German government. And for good reason: we have to deal with the problem of moral hazard. Risks and rewards should not be separated from each other. Investors, and that includes European bondholders, ultimately have to bear the rewards as well as the risks of decisions. But during the crisis it was almost exclusively European taxpayers who ultimately bore the risk of investors' decisions. "That is inadmissible. It was right to stop financial markets from disintegrating in the past, but it would be wrong to cushion their losses in the future. In the long run a division or risk undermines the foundations of capitalism, which needs risk and rewards ... to function properly."
