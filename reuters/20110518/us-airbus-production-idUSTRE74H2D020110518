 PARIS  (Reuters) - European planemaker Airbus ( EAD.PA ) on Wednesday confirmed plans to increase production of its best-selling A320 family of aircraft to 42 planes a month. 

 The increase, from 36 plane a month now and a previously planned level of 40 a month, will take place from the fourth quarter of 2012, the EADS ( EAD.PA ) unit said in a statement. EADS last week said it was considering increasing production to meet economic growth and Reuters reported Airbus had adopted a new level of 42 A320-family jets a month. The planned output increase consolidates Airbus's position as the world's largest planemaker ahead of rival Boeing ( BA.N ).
