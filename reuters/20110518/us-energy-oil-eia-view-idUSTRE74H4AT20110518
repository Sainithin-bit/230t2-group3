 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. crude oil and distillate inventories fell last week against forecasts for a build, while gasoline posted a far smaller than expected build, according to the Energy Information Administration on Wednesday. 

 Domestic crude oil stocks dipped 15,000 barrels in the week to May 13, compared with a forecast for a 1.0 million barrel build, the report showed. <EIA/S> Crude oil stored at the NYMEX Cushing, Oklahoma, hub dropped 1.59 million barrels to 40.02 million barrels, while imports were off 394,000 barrels per day to 8.54 million bpd. Distillate stockpiles also posted a surprise draw, dropping 1.16 million barrels versus expectations of a 700,000 barrel build. Gasoline stocks grew as expected but modestly, rising 119,000 barrels versus a forecast for a 800,000 barrel build. Refinery utilization rose 1.5 percentage point to 81.7 percent of capacity versus forecasts of a 0.2 percentage point rise. U.S. oil futures extended gains by about 50 cents after the data, trading up $2.56 to $99.47 a barrel by 10:38 a.m. EDT (1438 GMT). ANALYST COMMENTS BILL O'GRADY, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CONFLUENCE INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT, ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI: "There's not much there in these stats. The market was looking for a reason to trade higher and the draw at Cushing is that reason, I guess. Overall, this is a rather bearish report because of the soft gasoline demand numbers." CARL LARRY, DIRECTOR OF ENERGY DERIVATIVES AND RESEARCH, BLUE OCEAN BROKERAGE, NEW YORK: "Since they are mostly flat numbers outside of distillates, we need to peek further behind the curtain. It looks like the jump in demand needs to get some recognition. "The leap in gasoline demand to 9 million barrels per day was impressive considering the weather and the still high prices at the pump. We also saw the first significant hit to crude inventories this week as refiners started to ramp up to summer. We should start to see some major draws coming up. "Also the rise utilization, especially in PADD I, is showing some impressive gains. This drop in oil under $100 is enough to get refiners buying crude to actually use it." GENE MCGILLIAN, ANALYST, TRADITION ENERGY, STAMFORD, CONNECTICUT: "It looks like the stocks were broadly unchanged. Crude inventories were off minimally and distillates were off a million, but it doesn't amount to much. "The draw in Cushing stocks might be supportive but we need to see a few weeks of that for it to make a difference. "Yesterday we didn't see any fresh selling at $95 a barrel and if there is no strong rally in the dollar then we could be heading back above $100. It looks like the market is establishing a new range between $95 and $100 a barrel. "We need to keep an eye on whether the longs are going to come back into the market to push oil higher. The longer we go without liquidation selling, the more likely it is that the longs will come back in." ANDY LEBOW, BROKER, MF GLOBAL, NEW YORK: "The EIA data is a little bit constructive, There was a tiny crude stock draw, against forecasts of a build, and a small gasoline build, against forecasts for a bigger increase. On a weekly basis, demand for gasoline was up. And distillate stocks fell, instead of rising as forecast." PHIL FLYNN, ANALYST, PFGBEST RESEARCH, CHICAGO: "Gasoline production went up and refinery runs were up pretty good. I think what is supportive is that the gasoline build wasn't as much as expected, it's still less bullish than the API report. It could be a function of the fact we're getting ready to put gasoline on the rack for the upcoming Memorial Day holiday." "Product demand is still down from last year but improving. I think production will improve but gasoline supplies are still tight. There's some lingering concerns about the Mississippi River so that's getting us going as well. There's also some strong moves up in some of the other commodities, like grains, so we're getting a psychological boost from that rebound as well." MIKE ZAREMBSKI, SENIOR COMMODITIES ANALYST, OPTIONSXPRESS, CHICAGO: "The biggest thing is the surprising drop in crude inventories. I don't think anyone was expecting that, especially after the API numbers yesterday. "Also, gasoline stocks were up a little and we saw a drop in distillates. "This market is on a short-covering rebound after testing the $95 a barrel level yesterday. Grains and metals are also having rebound as the dollar starts to base itself here after a surprising climb in recent weeks. "I am long term bullish on energy markets, but we could see some sideways movement in the short term." JAN STUART, GLOBAL OIL ECONOMIST MACQUARIE SECURITIES, NEW YORK: "These statistics are bullish because they show that the U.S. has consistently lower imports and consistently higher refinery runs. This suggest that that global crude production is running a little short, probably by about 1-million barrels per day below normal. The only place anywhere in the world with a structural surplus is PADD 2 with all the crude coming in from Canada. "Gasoline demand is showing some improvement. The "other" demand category demand, where you typically see LPGs and such is also down significantly. That typically only happens in the fall during crop drying season. Something else is going on there." (Reporting by Jeffrey Kerr,  Janet McGurty ,  Edward McAllister ,  Gene Ramos ,  Eileen Moustakis ; Editing by Marguerita Choy)
