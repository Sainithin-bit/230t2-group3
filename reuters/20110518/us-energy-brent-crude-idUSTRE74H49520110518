 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. crude futures extended gains to more than $3 on Wednesday, edging above $100 a barrel after a weekly government report showed crude stocks fell slightly in the United States last week as refinery utilization rose. 

 On the New York Mercantile Exchange, June crude rose $3.17 to $100.08 a barrel by 11:44 a.m. EDT (1544 GMT), trading between $97.46 and $100.10. (Reporting by  Robert Gibbons )
