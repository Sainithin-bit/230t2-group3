 MILAN  (Reuters) - The idea of a soft-restructuring for Greece's debt is very unclear, European Central Bank Executive Board member Lorenzo Bini Smaghi said on Wednesday, adding that markets need clarity at such a crucial time. 

 "I'm opposed to soft-restructuring because I don't know what it means. Nobody knows what it means," he said during a panel discussion at a financial conference, answering a question on Greece. He said the present moment was very delicate and "magic formulas" should be avoided as they increase confusion on markets. Bini Smaghi said Greece faced a choice between unpopular measures to consolidate its public finances and a default, like that of Argentina, that would be a "disaster."
