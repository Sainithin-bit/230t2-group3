 BERLIN  (Reuters) - The International Monetary Fund should be left to deal with its immediate leadership issues internally and it is too early to discuss replacing Dominique Strauss-Kahn, Germany said on Wednesday. 

 Government spokesman Christoph Steegmans was responding to a proposal by U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner on Tuesday that the IMF should seek an interim head after Strauss-Kahn was arrested on charges of sexual assault in New York. "We believe the IMF will find a way to assure its capabilities and we also believe that it is good the IMF conducts this debate internally first," Steegmans said at a regular news conference. With Strauss-Kahn facing growing pressure to quit as head of the IMF after his arrest on attempted rape charges, Europe has sought to fend off a challenge from developing countries to fill a post it has traditionally held. Steegmans repeated Chancellor Angela Merkel's position that a European would be better positioned to handle the debt crisis on the region's periphery, should Strauss-Kahn be replaced, but stressed that it is too early to open such a discussion. "To be very honest, the question of a successor at the IMF is not yet being raised today. We must therefore await developments and the investigation in New York," he said.
