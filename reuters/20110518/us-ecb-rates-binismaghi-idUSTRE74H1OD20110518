 MILAN  (Reuters) - The European Central Bank must look at the euro zone as a whole when it sets its monetary policy and cannot delay possible rate rises to help weaker countries, ECB Executive Board member Lorenzo Bini Smaghi said. 

 Speaking at a conference on Wednesday, Bini Smaghi said the euro zone as a whole was growing more than expected and inflation risks had to be monitored. (Reporting by Valentina Za and Francesca Landini)
