 (Reuters) - The exposure of the UAE's banks to Dubai World's affiliated companies is still uncertain, in the absence of formal disclosure by the majority of the country's banks, which still face questions over transparency and disclosure. 

 Analysts also say that exposure to specific entities within Dubai World could be more significant for banks' balance sheets rather than total exposure per se. The banks below are those listed on the UAE exchanges. ABU DHABI NATIONAL BANK OF ABU DHABI NBAD said it had an exposure to Dubai World Group of $345 million in total. General corporate loans amount to $100 million to real estate developer Nakheel and $125 million to Limitless, another real estate firm. NBAD also has $114 million invested in Nakheel's $3.52 billion sukuk due December 14 and $6 million in the same sukuk, held in its trading portfolio and marked to market. ABU DHABI COMMERCIAL BANK A senior executive at ADCB told Reuters the bank has about $2.18 to $2.45 billion of exposure to Dubai World and related entities [ID:nGEE5AQ0I2]. Analysts put the figure slightly lower, around $1.9 billion. FIRST GULF BANK The bank has an exposure to Dubai World and associated companies of at least $1.36 billion, a senior executive said on Nov 27. [ID:nGEE5AQ0I2] An official statement from the lender rejected the figures but no disclosure on the level of exposure has been made. ABU DHABI ISLAMIC BANK - Undisclosed COMMERCIAL INTERNATIONAL BANK Egypt-based bank listed on the Abu Dhabi bourse said on November 30 it has no exposure to Dubai World or Nakheel RAK Bank - Undisclosed DUBAI Emirates NBD - Undisclosed Mashreq Bank - Undisclosed Dubai Islamic Bank - Undisclosed Shuaa Capital - Undisclosed Commercial Bank of Dubai - Undisclosed Ajman Bank - Ajman Bank has "no direct exposure to the announced delay" its acting chief executive officer, Ali E. Alshaqoosh Al Mueen, told Reuters on November 28. (Reporting by  Rachna Uppal ; Editing by Greg Mahlich)
