 LONDON  (Reuters) - Thirty global financial institutions have been selected for cross-border supervision exercises by regulators, the Financial Times reported on Monday. 

 Compiled under the guidance of the Financial Stability Board (FSB), an international body of regulators and central bankers, the list is part of an effort to pre-empt the spread of systemic risks in the event of a future financial crisis. Those featuring in the list will also be asked to write so-called "living wills" that outline plans to wind up banks in the aftermath of a crisis. The FSB was established in the summer of 2009 to address the dangers posed by systemically-important, cross-border financial institutions through better supervision and co-ordination. The list in full, as cited by the FT: North American banks: Goldman Sachs ( GS.N ), JP Morgan Chase ( JPM.N ), Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ), Bank of America-Merrill Lynch ( BAC.N ), Royal Bank of Canada ( RY.TO ) UK banks: HSBC ( HSBA.L ), Barclays ( BARC.L ), Royal Bank of Scotland ( RBS.L ), Standard Chartered ( STAN.L ) European banks: UBS ( UBSN.VX ), Credit Suisse ( CSGN.VX ), Societe General ( SOGN.PA ), BNP Paribas ( BNPP.PA ), Santander ( SAN.MC ), BBVA ( BBVA.MC ), Unicredit ( CRDI.MI ), Banca Intesa, Deutsche Bank ( DBKGn.DE ), ING ( ING.AS ) Japanese banks: Mizuho ( 8411.T ), Sumitomo Mitsui ( 8316.T ), Nomura ( 8604.T ), Mitsubishi UFJ ( 8306.T ) Insurers: AXA AXA.PA, Aegon ( AEGN.AS ), Allianz ( ALVG.DE ), Aviva AV.l, Zurich ( ZURN.VX ) and Swiss Re RUKN.VX (Reporting by  William James ; Editing by  Diane Craft )
