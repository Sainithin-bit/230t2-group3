 (Reuters) - Global semiconductor sales rose 5.1 percent in October sequentially, spurred by strength across all regions as electronic equipment manufacturers boost production for the holiday season, the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) said. 

 For the month, worldwide semiconductor sales rose to $21.7 billion from $20.6 billion in September. However, sales for October fell 3.5 percent from a year earlier. "Inventory management throughout the supply chain has been very tight, and this may extend the fourth-quarter build season by a few weeks," SIA said in a statement. Major chipmakers include Intel Corp ( INTC.O ), Advanced Micro Devices ( AMD.N ), ASML ( ASML.AS ), Texas Instruments TXN.N, National Semiconductor Corp ( NSM.N ), Nvidia Corp ( NVDA.O ), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co ( 2330.TW ) and Samsung Electronics Co ( 005930.KS ).
