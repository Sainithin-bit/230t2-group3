 TOKYO  (Reuters) - The Bank of Japan is far from finished easing monetary policy and may act again as soon as next month as a deepening nuclear power crisis jolt markets and plant shutdowns mark the escalating damage from Friday's massive earthquake, sources say. 

 The most likely option is to further boost the asset buying pool, which the central bank just doubled to 10 trillion yen on Monday, sources familiar with the BOJ thinking say, though the type of assets targeted for an increase would vary and depend on which markets would be most volatile at the time. The central bank eased policy by boosting funds available for asset purchases even as it maintained its view that Japan's economy was headed for a moderate recovery. That means that if economic indicators and BOJ's surveys of Japanese companies suggest the damage from the quake threatens Japan's return to a moderate economic recovery, the BOJ will not rule out easing further as early as next month, sources said. "The BOJ acted pre-emptively on Monday. It may not be over yet," one source said. "This is not the time to give markets the impression the BOJ is done with easing," another source said. Both spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter. Shortly after the board loosened its policy on Monday, Governor Masaaki Shirakawa told a news conference that the BOJ would act "appropriately" after studying economic data, which sources said was a code word for readiness for further easing if investor sentiment was to deteriorate further. The central bank will review rates twice next month, on April 6-7 and on April 28, when it issues its semi-annual economic outlook. Its closely-watched tankan survey, due on April 4, will offer clues on business sentiment, though it will not reflect much of the impact of last weekend's and this week's events as many companies probably responded before Friday's quake. The government has no authority to directly buy shares from the market and so has no way to stem sharp share falls other than to give markets verbal reassurances. It has done that, saying the situation remained under control and the economy was in good shape, but may need BOJ's help to convince investors. Economics Minister Kaoru Yosano expressed hope that the BOJ will continue to do its part to support the economy, hit by the quake just as it was about to emerge from a lull. "There is no doubt that the government and the BOJ need to make efforts to ease anxiety among the public and investors," he told reporters on Tuesday after Tokyo stocks slumped 10.6 percent, posting the worst two-day losing streak since 1987. BOJ officials had hoped the bank's monetary easing on Monday and huge fund injections would not just lower borrowing costs but soothe market nerves and slow declines in stock prices. But so far that proved to be wishful thinking. The possibility of the BOJ holding an emergency meeting to loosen policy is slim for now but cannot be ruled out if stock prices continue to tank, some analysts say. The BOJ has become more flexible than in the past in responding to sudden shocks and shifts in market developments. In August 2010, it loosened policy at an emergency meeting after a sharp spike in the yen that threatened to dampen business sentiment. (Editing by  Tomasz Janowski )
