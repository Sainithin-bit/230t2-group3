 (Reuters) - Libya is estimated to have lost two thirds of its oil output while fighting between government and rebel forces and international sanctions have halted all oil exports from Africa's third-largest producer. 

 Oil prices have rallied in the past weeks due to supply problems from Libya. Below are details on Libyan oil production, output, exports and customers: PRODUCTION AND LOST OUTPUT * OPEC member Libya is the world's 17th-largest oil producer, third-largest producer in Africa and holds the continent's largest crude oil reserves. It normally pumps around 1.6 million bpd, 85 percent of which is exported to Europe. * Output is normally equivalent to about 2 percent of global consumption, and unrest has cut output to about 500,000 million bpd as many foreign and local workers have left the fields. OIL TOWN BATTLES * Government troops retook the oil town of Brega on Sunday but rebel leaders said they moved back into the terminal town overnight and surrounded Gaddafi's forces. * The key port of Ras Lanuf fell to Gaddafi loyalists over the weekend. On Sunday workers were struggling to contain an oil tank fire at the terminal, damaged as a result of fighting. * West of Tripoli, Zawiyah was back under government control after troops crushed the revolt, leaving the city shattered. Zawiyah's oil refinery was operating again on Friday after being shut down by the violence earlier in the week, a refinery official said. * Forces loyal to Gaddafi were also in control of the port town of Es Sider, where air strikes destroyed storage tanks and other facilities during the fighting. OILFIELDS * Most of Libya's oilfields are around the Sirte Basin, which contains around 80 percent of its proven reserves. * The Hamada oilfield ceased production and the eastern fields of Sarir, Nafoora and Misla are producing around a third of their normal capacity, an official at state-owned oil company Agoco said on Thursday. * The Waha Oil Company, which operates the Waha, Dahra, Samah and Gialo fields, said its output had dropped to less than a third its normal level. * The Al Jurf offshore oil field and Mabruk field have stopped producing, Total CEO Christophe de Margerie said on Friday. REFINERIES, REFINED OIL PRODUCTS * Libya has five domestic refineries with a total crude distillation capacity of 378,000 bpd: Azzawiya Oil Refining Co (120,000 bpd), Sarir Refining (10,000 bpd), Sirte Oil Co (8,000 bpd), Tobruk Refining (20,000 bpd) and Ras Lanuf Oil & Gas Processing Co (220,000 bpd). * The IEA said Libya last year imported about 80,000 bpd of refined oil products and exported about 100,000 barrels per day of oil products to OECD countries, mostly in Europe. LIBYAN OIL COMPANIES * Libya's oil industry is run by the state-owned NOC, which accounts for around 50 percent of the country's output. Shokri Ghanem, head, of NOC called on employees to return to work and said on Monday he was hopeful production could soon increase. * A unit of NOC, Agoco, has decided to operate separately and market oil direct to foreign buyers until Gaddafi is overthrown and Tripoli free of his rule. FOREIGN PLAYERS * The total equity share of the following foreign companies -- many of which operate fields on behalf of Libyan National Oil Co -- amounts to about 460,000 bpd. The table below is based on data from consultancy IHS Herold and Reuters reports: Company Libya oil Libya share Libya share Libya oil & Status '000 bpd of total oil of total gas  share (percent) (percent) (percent) PORTS AND EXPORTS * Libya is a net exporter of crude oil and normally sells around 1.3 million bpd into world markets. It has domestic consumption estimated of around 270,000 bpd. * The major oil ports are closed and officials said Libya turned away tankers from various ports as storage facilities dried up, prompting ships to reroute to Saudi Arabia and Algeria to secure cargoes. * London's marine insurance market has added Libya to a list of areas deemed high risk, increasing significantly the cost of sailing to the country's ports. * Libya exports from six major terminals, listed below with loading volumes for January from the IEA: - Es Sider (447,000 bpd), Marsa El Brega (51,000 bpd), Ras Lanuf (195,000 bpd), Tobruk (51,000 bpd), Zueitina (214,000 bpd), Zawiyah (199,000 bpd), other unspecified terminals (333,000 bpd). SANCTIONS * A divided U.N. Security Council discussed authorizing a no-fly zone over Libya on Monday after the Arab League called for the 15-nation body to act. * Western countries, the European Union, Japan, South Africa and United Nations have all imposed sanctions on Libya and frozen government assets. * Major U.S. oil companies including Exxon Mobil ( XOM.N ) and ConocoPhillips ( COP.N ) have halted trade with Libya and banks are declining to clear payments in dollars CUSTOMERS * About 32 percent of Libya's oil goes to Italy, 14 percent to Germany, 10 percent to France and China and 5 percent to the United States. * Buyers have said the shortage can be covered by alternative sources such as Nigeria and Azerbaijan, which produce similar light, low-sulphur crude oils. * Saudi Arabia has raised production to fill the supply gap, but opinions differ how much spare capacity the kingdom has got and whether it can ramp up production further.
