 (Reuters) - The following is a roundup of the effects on manufacturers and other companies following the devastating earthquake and tsunami that struck the northeast coast of Japan on Friday. 

 - Canon said it may not be able to resume production this week at three plants that sustained serious damage in the quake. One manufactures lenses, another makes ink jet printers and the third produces equipment for manufacturing LCD screens. - Fuji Heavy Industries Co said all five of its car and car parts-related plants for its Subaru-brand vehicles in Gunma prefecture, north of Tokyo, would be closed at least until March 20. - Honda Motor Co said it planned to suspend all production in Japan at least until March 20. Honda's domestic plants were all closed on Monday except for a motorcycle plant on the southern island of Kyushu, which was shut on Tuesday. Honda manufactured 69,170 cars in January in Japan, where it made 24 percent of its cars. - Mazda Motor Corp said it would extend the suspension of production at two plants in southwestern Japan to March 20, but had not made a decision about how to proceed after that. - Nikon Corp halted operations on Monday at five of its production sites to check for equipment damage. They remained closed on Tuesday. - Nissan Motor Co said it stopped production at all four of its car assembly factories in Japan and was trying to secure a supply of parts and repair facilities before deciding on resumption. Nissan made 81,851 cars in January in Japan, where it manufactured 23 percent of its vehicles. - Panasonic said continuing aftershocks were preventing it from inspecting factories in northern Japan, including those making optical pick-ups and other electronic parts, digital cameras and audio equipment. A spokesman said none of the companies' manufacturing facilities was badly damaged but it would take time to resume operations as infrastructure needed to be restored and parts procurement and product delivery lines would also need to be secure. - Shin-Etsu Chemical, the world's leading maker of silicon wafers, restarted one factory near Tokyo on Monday. Two plants near the worst-hit areas remain offline with the company unable to say when operations would restart. A portion of the silicon wafer production at these plants is shipped to chip companies overseas. The company is trying to boost production elsewhere, particularly of 300-millimetre wafers, to make up the shortfall. - Sony Corp said eight factories were closed that make equipment including optical devices, IC cards, blu ray discs, semiconductor equipment and lithium batteries. Sony said it did not yet know when it would be able to reopen the plants. Some of the plants' output is supplied to other manufacturers, including customers overseas. - Suzuki Motor Corp has halted production at all six of its factories in Japan at least until March 16. Suzuki made 69,170 vehicles in January in Japan, where it produced 30 percent of its cars. - Toyota Motor Co has halted production at all its 12 factories in Japan at least until March 16. A three-day production halt would reduce output by 40,000 vehicles [ID:nL3E7EE0ED]. Toyota made 234,045 vehicles in January in Japan, where it manufactures 38 percent of its cars. - Toshiba said production had been halted at a factory in Iwate prefecture making system LSI chips used in microprocessors and image sensors. The company has begun work on bringing the factory back on line but does not know when production will resume. Other companies have also said they halted plants in the region as workers were evacuated following tsunami warnings or due to power outages. They include Asahi Kasei Corp, GlaxoSmithKline, JSR, Nestle, Nippon Paper Group, Sapporo Breweries Ltd and Morinaga Milk Industry.
