 (Reuters) - The following is a roundup of the effect on the energy and commodities sector of the devastating earthquake and tsunami that struck the northeast coast of Japan. 

 UTILITIES - Japanese utility Tohoku Electric declares force majeure on its near-term thermal coal shipments due to port damage. - Tokyo Electric Power Co (TEPCO) resumes work to pump sea water into the No.2 reactor at its Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant by opening a valve on the reactor's pressure vessel. The electric utility says nuclear fuel rods at the quake-stricken reactor were exposed fully for a second time as high pressure built inside the vessel and prevented the injection of sea water. - TEPCO says it will implement only part of planned rollover power outages as demand is not as high as it expected. It expects 330,000 households to be affected. The measures were put in place to cope with power shortages in the wake of Friday's earthquake. - TEPCO prepares to put sea water into the No. 2 reactor at its Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. The quake damaged cooling functions at the plant, in northern Japan. - TEPCO injects sea water into the No.1 and No.3 units at the plant to cool them down and reduce pressure inside reactor container vessels. - TEPCO resumes generating electricity from the oil-fired 350-megawatt No.3 unit at its Oi power station in Tokyo. The 350-MW No.2 unit at the plant remains closed. REFINERIES - JX Holdings says the refinery of subsidiary Kashima Oil Co remains shut since Friday's earthquake. - JX Holdings extinguishes a fire at its Sendai refinery, which originated from a land oil product shipping facility nearby. - Japan's Cosmo Oil has not yet extinguished a fire at its 220,000 barrels per day Chiba refinery. The fire at the storage tanks broke out after the quake. The company shut down the refinery, east of Tokyo after the quake. - JX Holdings declares force majeure on its refined product supplies as its stocks are depleted and distributions disrupted. The company is working to boost output at its refineries that are still operating and diverting products to domestic use instead of exports to meet a supply shortfall. - Maruzen Petrochemical Co Ltd shuts its sole naphtha cracker in Chiba, east of Tokyo, with capacity to produce 480,000 tonnes per year of ethylene. Maruzen's Keiyo Ethylene unit continues to operate a 690,000 tpy naphtha cracker in Chiba, a Maruzen spokesman said. - Kyokuto Petroleum's 175,000 barrels per day (bpd) Chiba refinery is yet to reopen. - JX Holdings shuts its 404,000 tonnes per year Kawasaki naphtha cracker near Tokyo. - Japan's Exxon Mobil group refiner TonenGeneral Sekiyu KK prepares to restart its 335,000 barrels per day Kawasaki plant, near Tokyo. It says it is doing its best to boost gasoline output at its Sakai and Wakayama plants to help ease a supply shortage in areas hit by the quake. - Mitsubishi Chemical halts two naphtha crackers at its Kashima plant after a power outage. - AOC Holdings' 140,000-bpd Sodegaura refinery is still operating but it has cut runs of two fluid catalytic cracking units. METALS - Toho Zinc Co stops operations at its 139,200 tonnes per year Annaka zinc smelter and Onahama plant, which is used to treat zinc for smelting. - Japanese steel mills divert metallurgical coal cargoes due to plant outages. Possible destinations for the coal include South Korea and China. - JFE Steel, the world's No. 5 steelmaker, halts production at a plant near Tokyo and global fourth-ranked Nippon Steel suspends operations at two small plants. - JFE says shipments from its 10 million tonnes per year Higashi Nihon plant near Tokyo has virtually stopped due to a power outage. - JFE resumes operations of two blast furnaces at its Higashi Nihon plant, one of its two mainstay plants. - Sumitomo Metal Industries Ltd, Japan's No. 3 steelmaker, says production at its main Kashima plant in Ibaraki prefecture remains suspended. - Sumitomo Metal's main Kashima plant has a fire in a gas holder, which has been extinguished but the company says it does not know yet when the plant will resume operations. Sumitomo Metal has a total capacity of 14 million tonnes a year and the Kashima plant produces 8.3 million tonnes. - Global fourth-ranked Nippon Steel's main Kimitsu plant in Tokyo, with a capacity of 10 million tonnes and three blast furnaces, resumes operations. Nippon Steel's total production capacity stands at about 33 million tonnes a year. - But the tsunami hit Nippon's small Kamaishi plant which is not operating. It produces 60,000 tonnes a month of downstream steel products. The company also briefly shuts a small seamless steel plant in Tokyo due to power outage. PORTS - Japanese ports handling as much as 7 percent of the country's industrial output sustain major damage, disrupting global supply chains and causing billions of dollars in losses. - The box shipping industry seen as the most strongly affected as the destroyed ports handle containerized cargo for Hitachi Ltd., Daikin Industries, and dozens of other companies. - Tokyo and all ports south of Japan's capital operate normally after briefly shutting down operations following Friday's disaster, while the rest of the country's ports are being assessed for damage. - The brief closure of all of Japan's ports is expected to cost the country more than $3.4 billion in lost seaborne trade, according to shipping trade publication Lloyd's List Intelligence. Maritime trade in the world's No. 3 economy totaled $1.5 trillion last year. - The northeast coast ports of Hachinohe, Sendai, Ishinomaki and Onahama are so severely damaged that they are not expected to return to operation for months, if not years. Hachinohe supplies fuel products to the local fishing fleet and U.S. military installations in Japan and South Korea, while Sendai handles a range of goods from rubber products to paper and machinery. - Japan's top crude oil and LNG port Chiba and the country's ninth-largest container port Kashima is also affected, but to a lesser extent. - Other damaged ports include Hitachinaka, Hitachi, Soma, Shiogama, Kesennuma, Ofunato, Kamashi and Miyako. The ports handle products ranging from sugar and non-ferrous metals to cars and wood products. - Japan's Sendai Gas says it is unable to reach the tsunami-hit Shinminato liquefied natural gas terminal near the port of Sendai in the country's northeast, but the terminal appears undamaged from a distance. All the remaining LNG terminals in Japan are in operation. - Three 80,000-tonne panamax vessels owned by Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha and one operated by Mitsui O.S.K. Lines are damaged or grounded by the quake. (Compiled by Manash Goswami and Randy Fabi; Editing by Himani Sarkar)
