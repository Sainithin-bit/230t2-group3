 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Olympus Corp's president-nominee Hiroyuki Sasa said on Monday the company would come up with a business strategy before considering capital tie-ups, and that its project team was still mulling a restructuring plan. 
 He said he would restructure the company's business portfolio including selling businesses, to put it on a sound financial footing. Olympus earlier on Monday proposed a new board of directors in a bid to recover from a $1.7 billion accounting fraud, nominating Sasa as president and former banker Yasuyuki Kimoto as chairman.
