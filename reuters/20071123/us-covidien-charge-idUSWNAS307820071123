 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Covidien Ltd ( COV.N ), the medical products company spun off by Tyco International Ltd ( TYC.N ) earlier this year, said on Friday it will record a non-cash charge of about $225 million in the fourth quarter for the impairment of assets associated with its Retail Products segment. 

 The charge reflects a lower fair value of the segment based on continued adverse trends in raw material and energy costs and a higher discount rate to reflect current market conditions, Covidien said in a filing. (Reporting by  Debra Sherman , editing by Gerald E. McCormick)
