 LONDON  (Reuters) - Stricken British bank Northern Rock NRK.L denied a newspaper report on Friday of a "massive hole" in its assets and said it had more than enough assets to cover its borrowings from the Bank of England. 

 The Guardian newspaper said earlier that about 53 billion pounds ($110 billion) of Northern Rock's mortgages were owned by a separate Jersey-based company called Granite and that this called into question government claims that taxpayers' money was safe. "Northern Rock's Granite program is well defined and very similar to other UK issuers of securitization. The market is very familiar with Northern Rock's Granite program -- monthly investment reports are published," a spokesman said. "Northern Rock has assets of over 100 billion pounds. Only around half of those assets are securitized as part of the Granite program, leaving around 50 billion pounds in unencumbered assets." "Against claims that Northern Rock's loan with the Bank of England is in order of 23 billion pounds, this would therefore suggest that Northern Rock is able to cover such a figure by around twofold." Northern Rock was forced to go to the Bank of England for emergency loans two months ago, as the global squeeze on credit demolished its funding strategy, prompting the first run on a British bank for over 140 years. Its shares have plunged over 90 percent this year. At 1125 GMT, the stock was down 4.5 percent at 80.3 pence, valuing the business at about 338 million pounds.
