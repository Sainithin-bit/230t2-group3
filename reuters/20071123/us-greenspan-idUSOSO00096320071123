 OSLO  (Reuters) - Former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said on Friday that chances of a U.S. recession would be more than 50 percent if it were not for the remarkable flexibility of the economy. 

 "The probability of a recession would be higher than 50 percent if it hadn't been for such a remarkable degree of flexibility," Greenspan told a financial audience in the Norwegian capital. Greenspan said that the inflationary impact of a weakening dollar varies over time. "One has to ask what are the inflation consequences of a weakening dollar. It turns out sometimes it is not important, sometimes it is very important," he said. (Reporting by Oslo newsroom; Editing by Ron Askew)
