 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Foreign central banks were net sellers of U.S. debt last week, Federal Reserve data showed on Friday. 

 The Fed said its holdings of Treasury and agency debt kept for overseas central banks fell $5.79 billion in the week ended Nov 21 to stand at a total of $2.027 trillion. The breakdown of custody holdings showed overseas central banks sold $14.51 billion in Treasury debt to stand at a total $1.223 trillion. The foreign institutions bought securities from government-sponsored agencies like Fannie Mae FNM.N and Freddie Mac FRE.N, adding $8.72 billion to their holdings, to stand at a total $804.39 billion. Overseas central banks, particularly those in Asia, have been huge buyers of U.S. debt in recent years, and own over a quarter of marketable Treasuries.
