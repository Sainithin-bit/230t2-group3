 (Reuters) - Wireless chipmaker Broadcom Corp ( BRCM.O ) said a federal judge affirmed a jury verdict that found rival Qualcomm Inc ( QCOM.O ) infringes three Broadcom patents. 

 Irvine, California-based Broadcom said it will not seek a new trial and will accept the $19.6 million in compensatory damages as originally awarded by the jury. The company said it will pursue an injunction against Qualcomm's infringing products. Broadcom will seek to enjoin Qualcomm from making, using, selling and developing third-generation WCDMA and EV-DO cellular chips that infringe any of the patents, the company said in a statement.
