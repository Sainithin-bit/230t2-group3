 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Freddie Mac FRE.N said Friday it plans to sell $4 billion of reference bills next week. 

 The scheduled offerings are: -- $2 billion of three-month bills due February 26, 2008, to be sold and settled on Monday, November 26; -- $1 billion of six-month bills due May 27, 2008, to be sold and settled on Monday; and -- $1 billion of one-month bills due December 26, 2007, to be sold and settled on Wednesday, November 28. The bills will be sold over the Internet in a Dutch auction. In such uniform price auctions, successful bidders pay only the price of the lowest accepted bid rather than the actual price as in a conventional multiple-price auction. Bids will be accepted from authorized dealers from 8:00 a.m. EST until 9:45 a.m.
