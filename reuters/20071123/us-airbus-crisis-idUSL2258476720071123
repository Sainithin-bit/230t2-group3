 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - The workers' council at European aircraft manufacturer Airbus disputed remarks made by management on Thursday that the weak U.S. dollar threatened the company's survival, according to the Berliner Zeitung newspaper. 

 The strength of the euro creates a problem for the company but does not threaten the planemaker's existence, Ruediger Luetjen, chief of Airbus' workers' council said, according to Friday's editions of the newspaper. Airbus Chief Executive Tom Enders had said on Thursday the weakness of the dollar is threatening the survival of Airbus, which is owned by European aerospace and defense group EADS ( EAD.PA ). The dollar hit a new low against the euro, the Swiss franc and a basket of currencies on Thursday. (Reporting by  Peter Dinkloh , editing by Leslie Gevirtz)
