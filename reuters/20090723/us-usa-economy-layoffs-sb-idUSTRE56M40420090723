 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The number of mass layoffs by U.S. employers edged down in June from May's record high, with the hard-hit manufacturing sector accounting for a big chunk, Labor Department data showed on Thursday. 

 The number of mass layoff actions -- defined as job cuts involving at least 50 people from a single employer -- slipped to 2,763 last month from 2,933 in May, which tied a record high set in March. Of the June total, 1,235 mass layoffs were reported in the manufacturing sector. The weak labor market has become a thorny problem from policymakers and the White House. While the broader economy appears to be stabilizing, rising unemployment threatens to undermine the recovery. The jobless rate hit a 26-year high of 9.5 percent in June, and many economists expect it to peak above 10 percent. In the 19 months since the current recession started in December 2007, the total number of mass layoff events was 39,822, accounting for slightly more than 4 million jobs, the Labor Department said.
