 HAMBURG, Germany  (Reuters) - Volkswagen remains on track to take a stake in sports car maker Porsche AG, a source at Volkswagen told Reuters on Thursday. 

 The source also said that Volkswagen's supervisory board, which is meeting in the southern town of Stuttgart, was set to call for a timetable to be agreed for ongoing talks over the combination of Volkswagen and Porsche. Both sides have said they want to form an "integrated" automotive group though details of that plan remain sketchy. Porsche has been reluctant to cede its independence to much larger Volkswagen.
