 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The number of U.S. workers filing new claims for jobless benefits rose roughly as expected last week, but the data was distorted by an unusual pattern of layoffs in the automotive industry. 

 KEY POINTS: * Initial claims for state unemployment insurance rose by 30,000 to a seasonally adjusted 554,000 in the week ended July 18, the Labor Department said on Thursday. * Analysts polled by Reuters had expected claims to increase to 550,000 from a previously reported 522,000. COMMENTS: TODD LEONE, HEAD OF LISTED TRADING, COWEN & CO., NEW YORK: "Looks like (the numbers) are OK. Jobless was pretty much right in-line, continuing was a little weaker, which is good -- futures moved down a little bit on that, which was kind of surprising. It's all about earnings today, it's not about the numbers. Seems like we've had some decent earnings out this morning. Ford looks good, Bristol, Raytheon had good earnings. It's been all about earnings, so many companies, Wyeth had good earnings..." ROBERT MACINTOSH, CHIEF ECONOMIST, EATON VANCE CORP., BOSTON: "Quite honestly, there were so many seasonal adjustments involved here that are just so out of whack because of all of the plant shutdowns that happened much earlier than the seasonal adjustments would have anticipated, that I'm not sure you can read very much into the week-to-week numbers. (Four-week average) "Over last two weeks it's come down quite a bit, maybe that's being overstated a little bit, but I do think it tells you there's a trend involved here. I wouldn't say the economy's necessarily improving, but it's not getting worse. And maybe it is improving slightly, ever so slightly." "I don't think this is telling us anything new. I think the average investor/economist was expecting this type of thing. The economy is hopefully bottoming here and I think the question is how much growth do we get and how quickly does it come, as opposed to are we going to get worse and worse." ZACH PANDL, ECONOMIST, NOMURA SECURITIES INTERNATIONAL, NEW YORK: "This is consistent with our view that there have been some statistical quirks in the past few weeks. We continue to believe the labor market is healing and it will take a few weeks for the data to give a clearer indication on the payroll picture. "We expect a payroll decline somewhere in a range at 300,000 or so in July. All labor indicators point to improvement, but jobs will continue to be lost and the unemployment rate will rise further. "Continuing claims are improving, suggesting some people may be able to re-enter into the job market after an extended period. But it may also be the fact that it stems from expiration for some people to receive benefits so we have to be careful in interpreting this number." PETER KENNY, MANAGING DIRECTOR, KNIGHT EQUITY MARKETS, JERSEY CITY, NEW JERSEY: "This is not enough to derail the current momentum in the market. The momentum is coming on earnings, which are solidly better than expected across many sectors. The number rose, but it's well within the band of expectations. It's a bit of a dampener, but it's not enough of one to halt the upward movement in the equity markets."
