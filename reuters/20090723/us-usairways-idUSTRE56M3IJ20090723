 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - US Airways Group ( LCC.N ) on Thursday reported a second-quarter net profit, reversing a year-ago loss and beating expectations on lower fuel costs, but said it is not counting on a quick rebound in travel demand. 

 The company said its second-quarter net profit amounted to $58 million, or 42 cents per share, compared with a loss of $568 million, or $6.17 per share, a year ago. Excluding one-time items, the company lost 77 cents per share, which compares with a Wall Street consensus forecast for a loss of 84 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Shares in US Airways rose 3 cents to $2.08 on the New York Stock Exchange. The company reported a realized fuel hedging loss of $135 million. "Looking forward to the second half of 2009, the revenue environment continues to be difficult to forecast," Chief Executive Doug Parker said in a statement. "We have seen an encouraging though modest improvement in revenues over the past several weeks," he said. "But we are not counting on a quick recovery." The airline industry has been battered by a steep decline in business travel demand as companies slog through the economic recession. The carrier said its revenue fell 18.4 percent to $2.66 billion. The company ended the quarter with $2.3 billion in cash and investments. (Reporting by Kyle Peterson; Editing by  Brian Moss )
