 (Reuters) - The board of sportscar maker Porsche conceded a power struggle with mass-market rival Volkswagen on Thursday, by axing its CEO and planning to raise funds to prepare for their merger. 

 Below is a timeline of the paths that have led the two companies to the point of merger: September 25, 2005 - Porsche says it plans to buy a stake of about 20 percent in VW. Three days later it emerges with a 10.3 percent voting stake, subsequently increased via forward-rate agreements. August 2, 2006 - Porsche Chief Executive Wendelin Wiedeking first advocates the abolition of Germany's "VW Law" that caps voting rights in VW at 20 percent. November 15 - Porsche's supervisory board authorizes management to increase its VW stake to 29.9 percent, triggering speculation it plans to gain majority control. April 30, 2007 - Porsche submits mandatory takeover offer after crossing 30 percent threshold. October 23 - European Court of Justice rules against VW Law.

October 26 - Porsche says it holds stock and options that give it control of 74 percent of VW's votes and announces plans for a "domination" agreement.
