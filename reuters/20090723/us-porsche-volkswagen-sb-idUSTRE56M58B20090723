 (Reuters) - Porsche Automobil Holding SE directors sacked the firm's CEO and CFO following an all-night board meeting, clearing the way for the carmaker to merge with Volkswagen, Europe's largest carmaker. 

 Following are some key facts about the deal: * Creation of a combined automotive group is targeted for mid-2011 * Details on plans for the combined company to be mapped out at VW supervisory board meeting on August 13. * The combined company would generate more than 120 billion euros in pro-forma revenue from the sale of nearly 6.4 million vehicles, based on figures from the two carmakers' past fiscal years. * Volkswagen will buy a stake in Porsche's sports car business that it would increase over time. * German state of Lower Saxony will retain its 20 percent blocking stake in VW. * Qatar will buy Porsche options on VW stock equivalent to a 17 percent voting stake. * Porsche has authorized its new management to bring negotiations with Qatar over the sale of a stake in exchange-listed Porsche Automobil Holding SE to a successful conclusion.
