 STOCKHOLM  (Reuters) - Swedish telecom equipment maker Ericsson ( ERICb.ST ) is bidding for Nortel's ( NRTLQ.PK ) mobile network division, an Ericsson spokesperson said on Thursday. 

 "We always look at opportunities that can be of interest for Ericsson and create value for us, and we participate in this process to the point it makes sense," Ase Lindskog, spokeswoman at Ericsson, told Reuters. Canada's The Globe and Mail reported earlier on Thursday Ericsson had submitted a bid worth $730 million on Tuesday, but Lindskog declined to comment on that figure. (Reporting by Sven Nordenstam)
