 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - United Parcel Service Inc ( UPS.N ), the world's largest package delivery company, said on Thursday that the industry's "pricing environment remains rational" despite the downturn that has sent freight volumes lower and weighed on its profits. 

 During a conference call to discuss its second-quarter earnings, UPS said any pressure to reduce prices was coming from customers "urgently looking for ways to reduce expenses," not from its competitors. The company also said that it wasn't seeing any pickup in package activity coming from small businesses, a metric some analysts consider an important indicator of a broader economic rebound. UPS said that so far in July, there have been "no huge changes" in industry business trends. (Reporting by  James Kelleher , editing by Gerald E. McCormick)
