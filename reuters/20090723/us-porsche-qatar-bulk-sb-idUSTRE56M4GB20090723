 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - The families that own Porsche will take up the bulk of the German sportscar maker's planned capital increase of at least 5 billion euros ($7.1 billion), several people familiar with the matter said on Thursday. 

 Under the plan, the Gulf state of Qatar will receive the right to take up around 5 percent of Porsche's ordinary shares and 5 percent of its preferred shares, the sources said. Whether Qatar would use this right would depend on the development of Porsche's share price, they said. Porsche declined to comment on the matter. Porsche earlier announced plans for a capital increase that will help it pay down some of its debt totaling more than 10 billion euros as it prepares to merge with Volkswagen.
