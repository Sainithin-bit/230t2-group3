 JAKARTA  (Reuters) - Indonesia Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati, a top reformer in President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono's cabinet, may be replaced by February, the Jakarta Post reported, quoting anonymous sources from a political party. 

 Indrawati and Vice President Boediono are considered the main drivers of reform in Southeast Asia's biggest economy and play a critical role in attracting foreign investment for infrastructure and other projects. The loss of one or other from the cabinet would severely dent investor confidence in Indonesia's commitment to reform and would hit the rupiah currency, bonds and stocks. Both technocrats have been questioned in recent weeks by a parliamentary committee over their decision to bail out Bank Century, a small bank, at the height of the 2008 financial crisis in order to avert a wider financial panic. Officials from the Golkar Party, the political party headed by tycoon Aburizal Bakrie who has long resisted Indrawati's reforms, were quoted by the Jakarta Post saying that the finance minister would probably be replaced by Anggito Abimanyu, head of the fiscal policy agency. President Yudhoyono was re-elected in July thanks to his government's economic policies, reforms, and efforts to tackle corruption. Indrawati and Boediono, who was governor of the central bank at the time, both approved the 6.7 trillion rupiah ($729.4 million) government rescue of Bank Century late in 2008 as Indonesia started to feel the impact of the global financial crisis.
