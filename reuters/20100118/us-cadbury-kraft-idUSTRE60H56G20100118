 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Kraft Foods Inc KFT.N and Britain's Cadbury Plc CBRY.L are holding talks about a potential friendly deal to create the world's largest confectionery group, a source familiar with the matter said on Monday. 

 Cadbury had steadfastly rejected Kraft's 10.5 billion pound ($17.1 billion) hostile takeover bid since a brief conversation between the two sides in late August. Kraft faces a deadline on Tuesday to raise its bid high enough to entice a majority of Cadbury shareholders. When asked why the two companies came to the table after nearly five months, the source said: "Both parties felt that they were potentially able to realize their most important needs" through negotiation, on price and governance issues. The Financial Times said the two sides were discussing a deal value at 840 pence to 850 pence per share for Cadbury, compared to Kraft's current offer of 769p per share, and that an agreement could be announced as early as Tuesday.
