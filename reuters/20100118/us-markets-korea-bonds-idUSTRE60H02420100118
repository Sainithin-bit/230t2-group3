 SEOUL  (Reuters) - South Korean treasury bond futures rose early on Monday, lifted by U.S. Treasuries' rally on tame consumer price data and weak domestic shares  .KS11 . 

 The upside, however, was capped as investors awaited weekly bond auctions. The Finance Ministry is set to issue 10-year notes worth up to 1.5 trillion won ($1.34 billion) and the central bank will sell 5.8 trillion won in monetary stabilization bonds. The March treasury bond futures contract added 5 ticks to 109.60 as of 0009 GMT. Bond yields were not available yet. (Reporting by Seo Eun-kyung; Editing by  Ken Wills )
