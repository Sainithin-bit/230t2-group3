 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Claire's Stores Inc. CLE.N said on Thursday an overwhelming majority of its shareholders voted to approve the merger agreement with an affiliate of Apollo Management LP. 

 The number of votes cast for approval of the merger agreement represented about 75 percent of the combined voting power of the retailer's common stock and Class A common stock outstanding and entitled to vote. Upon the closing of the merger, the company's shareholders will be entitled to receive $33 in cash, without interest, for each share of Claire's common stock and Class A common stock. The parties expect the merger to close next week.
