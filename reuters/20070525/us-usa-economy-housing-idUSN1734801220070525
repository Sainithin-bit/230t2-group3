 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The pace of existing home sales in the United States in April fell to their lowest since June 2003 while inventories swelled, the National Association of Realtors said in a report on Friday that showed more weakness than analysts had expected. 

 Sales were off 2.6 percent in April to an annualized pace of 5.99 million units. The inventory of homes for sale grew 10.4 percent to 4.2 million units, which represents an 8.4 months' supply at the current sales pace. Economists polled by Reuters were expecting home resales to rise to a 6.14 million-unit pace from the 6.12 million-unit rate initially reported for March. The March sales pace was revised to 6.15 million. March was the ninth straight month in which prices of existing homes dropped from year-ago levels, with the national median price down 0.8 percent to $220,900. Prices for U.S. government bonds rose and the dollar fell as the data was seen as keeping alive the possibility that a downturn in the U.S. housing market may have further to run. Stock prices slightly pared gains. NAR blamed the weak data on a hangover of the subprime lending crisis and unusually warm winter weather that pushed some buyers into the market earlier in the year. "January and February were very healthy... we are seeing a residual weather impact on current sales data," said Lawrence Yun, chief economist for the trade association. He also said a small sample of data from some regions collected recently indicates "a notable improvement" in the market in May. Economists read troubling signs in the inventory rise. "The most disconcerting thing in the report is the increase in inventory. That's the biggest weight in the market is the glut. The market doesn't find a bottom until sellers start cutting their prices," said Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moody's Economy.com of Westchester, Pennsylvania. Friday's data comes a day after a report that showed sales of new homes rose 16.2 percent in April, the sharpest climb in 14 years, while prices fell a record 11 percent, in a sign that builders are taking extraordinary steps to move houses. Home sales were down across all regions with the Northeast seeing the largest drop of 8.8 percent. In the West, sales were off 1.7 percent while they were down 0.7 percent in the Midwest and 1.2 percent in the South.
