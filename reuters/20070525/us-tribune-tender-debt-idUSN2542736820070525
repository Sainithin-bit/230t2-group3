 (Reuters) - Tribune Co. TRB.N said shareholders tendered almost twice as many shares than what the media company sought to repurchase as part of a $8.2 billion deal to go private. 

 In a statement, the media company said shareholders tendered about 224 million shares, representing 92 percent of its outstanding shares. Tribune had earlier said it would repurchase 126 million shares, representing more than half its outstanding shares, at $34 a share, or about $4.3 billion. As more than 126 million shares have been tendered, Tribune said it will purchase shares on a pro rata basis. Tribune said it will commence cash payment for shares purchased in the offer by June 5. Merrill Lynch & Co., Citigroup Global Markets Inc., J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. and Banc of America Securities LLC served as co-dealer managers for the tender offer, Tribune said. Tribune sold more than $7 billion in loans last week to fund the tender offer as part of the deal and to refinance some existing debt. In early April, Chicago real estate magnate Sam Zell agreed to acquire Tribune in a deal that would take the media company private but saddle it with $8.4 billion of new debt. The publisher of the Chicago Tribune and the Los Angeles Times had said it would sell the Chicago Cubs baseball team and a 25 percent interest in Comcast SportsNet Chicago to help pay down debt of over $13 billion.
