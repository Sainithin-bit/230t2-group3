 LONDON  (Reuters) - A trio of banks led by Royal Bank of Scotland ( RBS.L ) will probably on Tuesday make a formal takeover offer for Dutch bank ABN AMRO AAH.AS, said sources familiar with the matter on Friday. 

 RBS, Fortis FOR.BR and Santander ( SAN.MC ), who will on Tuesday provide an update on their plans to bid for ABN, currently view the launching of an offer as their preferred option, the sources said. No firm decision has yet been taken however and they could still choose a different option in the run-up to Tuesday, the sources said. RBS declined to comment.
