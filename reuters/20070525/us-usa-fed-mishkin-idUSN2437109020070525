 DALLAS  (Reuters) - Federal Reserve economists think aging workers and a shrinking workweek mean the maximum sustainable U.S. economic growth rate may slow, Fed Governor Frederic Mishkin said on Thursday. 

 "Given slower projected population growth and what appears to be a downward trend in the number of hours in the average workweek, these results suggest that potential output growth will be slower than it otherwise would have been," Mishkin said at a monetary policy conference organized by the Dallas Fed. A slower speed limit for the U.S. economy could mean the Fed will be patient with U.S. growth, which has been sluggish since early last year. The Fed has indicated its predominant concern is that inflation may not ease from elevated levels but has said that holding benchmark interest rates steady at 5.25 percent should allow price pressures to recede. Mishkin said it is important for the U.S. central bank to estimate the fastest pace the economy can grow without causing the demand for products and workers to outpace supply, generating inflation. The Fed must also calculate the difference between how much the economy is actually growing and its potential growth rate -- the output gap. "We cannot escape the need for information about output gaps so that we can forecast the future path of inflation and evaluate the current setting of our monetary policy instruments," he said. However, measures of output and output gaps are highly uncertain and can therefore provide misleading signals, Mishkin said. "In assessing whether there is slack in the economy, we at central banks look not only at our estimates of output gaps, but also at a wide range of indicators drawn from the labor, product, and financial markets to provide us with a perspective on the balance of supply and demand in the economy," he said. At the end of the day, "We must never take our eye off the inflation ball," Mishkin said. In addition, the Fed must ensure that inflation expectations are firmly tethered, and be prepared to back words with deeds if prices start to pick up, Mishkin said later in response to questions. "If inflation starts to get out of hand then, in fact, the Federal Reserve has to take appropriate steps," he said. He said anchoring expectations helped the economy weather unexpected shocks, like sharp rises in the price of energy, and also overcome tight capacity utilization conditions during periods when unemployment was relatively low. The Fed has been studying why labor productivity growth grew so robustly in the second half of the 1990s and continued at a surprisingly strong pace in the first half of the current decade, Mishkin said. Productivity gains since 2000 have been driven by industry restructuring, unlike earlier gains that fueled by new technology, he said.
