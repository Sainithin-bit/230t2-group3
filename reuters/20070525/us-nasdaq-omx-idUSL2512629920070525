 NEW YORK/STOCKHOLM  (Reuters) - Nasdaq Stock Market Inc. ( NDAQ.O ) said on Friday it would buy Nordic markets owner OMX AB OMX.ST for $3.7 billion, giving it a beachhead for more European deals, including perhaps another run at the London Stock Exchange. 

 Nasdaq, the second-largest U.S. stock exchange, would also gain access to stock and options markets in Europe as well as OMX's successful exchange technology business. The Nasdaq deal follows the recent acquisition of Euronext by the owner of the New York Stock Exchange and could pressure the London Stock Exchange and other European rivals to consolidate. Nasdaq earlier this year failed to win control of the London Stock Exchange ( LSE.L ), but still owns about a third of the UK exchange and can relaunch a bid in 2008. OMX itself tried to bid for the LSE in 2000. "The broad perception on the street is OMX will be a good platform for bidding for the LSE," said Adam Compton, who co-heads global financial research at RCM Global Investors in San Francisco. The acquisition will give Nasdaq some European management, Compton said. But Nasdaq investors did not seem overjoyed at the deal. The exchange's shares were down $1.19, or 3.5 percent, at  $32.79. "OMX is not LSE," said Sang Lee of consulting firm Aite Group. "It's a deal that Nasdaq had to make to continue their expansion, but perhaps shareholders weren't as excited about this as they would have been with a deal with an exchange of LSE's caliber." Nasdaq is taking on more debt for the acquisition, which spurred credit rating agency Moody's Investors Service to change the outlook on Nasdaq's ratings to "negative" from "stable." OMX shares were up nearly 11 percent at 199.50 crowns. The companies expect total pretax annual merger benefits of $150 million. CONSOLIDATION PRESSURE U.S. exchanges, many of which have only recently gone public, are now under pressure to make acquisitions or put themselves up for sale as domestic competition heats up and margins shrink. Besides the NYSE Euronext NYX.N deal, Frankfurt's Deutsche Boerse ( DB1Gn.DE ) has made an offer for the International Securities Exchange. ISE.N Nasdaq has been contending with new rivals like BATS Trading, an electronic communication network that has handled more than 10 percent of Nasdaq-listed volume. And European exchanges face a new threat from investment banks, which plan to form their own European share trading platform. Speaking on a conference call, Nasdaq Chief Executive Bob Greifeld did not rule out making future acquisitions. "We certainly expect to participate in the global consolidation in the years to come," Greifeld said. BIGGER TECH BUSINESS Combining the largest U.S. electronic stock market with OMX, which operates exchanges in Stockholm, Helsinki, Copenhagen, Reykjavik and the Baltic states, the merged entity would list about 4,000 companies with an aggregate market capitalization of approximately $5.5 trillion. Nasdaq also anticipates building on OMX's technology business , which accounts for a third of the Scandinavian company's annual profit. "The relationships associated with that technology business can not be overestimated," said Greifeld on the conference call. OMX's technology clients include ISE, the top U.S. equity options exchange. Nasdaq previously announced plans to launch an options platform of its own. "We have set out a clear path to build an options exchange and that progress will be, I think, augmented and enhanced by this transaction," said Greifeld. ACCEPTANCES Nasdaq is offering 0.502 new shares and 94.3 Swedish crowns ($13.79) in cash for each OMX share in the bid, which has the backing of the OMX board and major shareholders of both companies. The companies said that based on Nasdaq's May 23 closing price, the offer valued OMX at 208.1 crowns per share, or 25.1 billion crowns ($3.67 billion). The companies said they had acceptances worth 16.6 percent of OMX from shareholders, including the Wallenberg family's Investor AB ( INVEb.ST ) and OMX Chief Executive Magnus Bocker. The Swedish government, which owns 6.6 percent of OMX, but has the company on its privatization list, said it would take a look at the deal before deciding on its stance. Nasdaq shareholders will own about 72 percent of the new company, the statement said, and the new group will have a combined market capitalization of about $7.1 billion. JPMorgan advised Nasdaq on the deal, while Morgan Stanley, Lenner & Partners and Credit Suisse advised OMX.
