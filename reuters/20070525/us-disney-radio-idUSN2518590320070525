 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - The Walt Disney Co. ( DIS.N ) on Friday set a record date of June 6 and a closing date of June 12 for its previously announced spin-off and merger of ABC Radio stations and programming operation with Citadel Broadcasting Corp CDL.N. 

 Disney plans to transfer the radio business, including 22 large-market radio stations and the ABC Radio Network, to a wholly owned subsidiary called ABC Radio Holdings Inc. and to distribute stock in the new company to its shareholders. ABC Radio Holdings then will merge with a wholly owned subsidiary of Citadel. Citadel will exchange one share of its stock for each share of ABC Radio Holdings, Disney said. The transaction does not include Disney's ESPN Radio or its Radio Disney operations. The transaction received regulatory approval in March, more than a year after Disney said it would divest the assets in a deal worth about $2.7 billion. Despite modifications to the deal in November, the transaction appears set to close as Disney expected in the first half of 2007.
