 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Tribune Co. TRB.N has called off its agreement to sell two of its daily newspapers in Connecticut to Gannett Co. Inc. ( GCI.N ) after an arbitrator ruled the sale of one of the papers would violate a union contract. 

 Tribune had planned to sell daily papers The Advocate and Greenwich Time to USA Today publisher Gannett for $73 million. An arbitrator ruled last month that Tribune could not sell The Advocate unless Gannett assumed an existing contract as a condition of the sale. Gannett declined to do this, Tribune said, which prompted the company to cancel the sale. Tribune will seek other offers for the papers. Gannett and union spokeswomen were not immediately available for comment. The Advocate's publisher, Durham Monsma, declined to comment. The papers are two of Tribune's smallest dailies. The company also owns The Hartford Courant in Connecticut, as well as other large papers, such as the Los Angeles Times and the Chicago Tribune. Tribune in march said it would sell the papers because they do not fit the company's focus on larger publishing and online businesses. The company had hoped to sell the papers to move it past its goal of shedding $500 million in "non-core" assets. Separately, Tribune said on Friday that shareholders tendered nearly twice the number of shares it wanted to repurchase as part of an $8.2 billion deal to go private.
