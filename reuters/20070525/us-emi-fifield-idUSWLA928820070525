 LONDON  (Reuters) - Former EMI Group Plc EMI.L Chief Executive Jim Fifield is interested in potentially making an offer for the world's third biggest music company, he said on Friday. 

 Fifield said he had been working with investment management group Corvus Capital CVS.L on a bid, before Corvus announced on Wednesday it was no longer interested. In a statement, Fifield said he was not held to those terms. "Jim Fifield therefore wishes to confirm that he remains interested in potentially making an offer for EMI," the statement said. "There is no certainty that an offer will be made or as to the terms on which any offer might be made." The New York Post reported on its Web site earlier this week that Fifield and Corvus wanted to make an offer for the group at 278 pence a share. It has since reported that he has received financial commitments from members of the Qatari royal family. It said Fifield wanted to run EMI's recorded music division and sell its more reliable and cash-rich publishing assets to record executive Charles Koppelman and private equity firm GTCR Golder Rauner. EMI's board on Monday recommended a 265 pence a share offer from private equity firm Terra Firma, valuing the company at around 2.4 billion pounds ($4.8 billion). Its shares were up 1.1 percent at 275-1/2 pence at 0810 GMT. Investors are also waiting to see if Warner Music Group WMG.N will make a counteroffer. Sources familiar with the situation have told Reuters that Warner had been looking at EMI's books when the London-based group announced the Terra Firma deal.
