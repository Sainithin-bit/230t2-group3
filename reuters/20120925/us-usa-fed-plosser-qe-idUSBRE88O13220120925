 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Federal Reserve officials may have already reached the boundaries of what monetary policy can do to boost economic growth, Philadelphia Fed President Charles Plosser said on Tuesday. 
 Plosser said policymakers should show "more humility" in acknowledging the limitations of what shifts in interest rates can accomplish, or risk losing credibility, Plosser said. (Reporting by  Pedro da Costa ; Editing by  James Dalgleish )
