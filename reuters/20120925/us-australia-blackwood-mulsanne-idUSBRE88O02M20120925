 SYDNEY  (Reuters) - Coal magnate Nathan Tinkler's Mulsanne Resources is being sued for $30 million by junior coal explorer Blackwood Resources ( BWD.AX ), the second legal action launched against the resources entrepreneur this month. 
 Blackwood said in a statement it has applied to have Mulsanne, a private investment vehicle owned by Tinkler, wound up after it failed to pay A$28.4 million ($30 million) for an agreed stake in the junior coal explorer. Tinkler and Mulsanne did not immediately reply when contacted by e-mail for comment. Tinkler, who has an empire spanning mining, property development, sports teams and horse breeding, last month abandoned a A$5.3 billion privatization takeover of Whitehaven Coal ( WHC.AX ). A source familiar with the deal said that the 36-year-old failed to raise enough equity, falling short by around A$900 million. A former electrician who made his fortune by taking high-risk bets in the resources sector, Tinkler is also being sued by property group Mirvac ( MGR.AX ) to recover about A$14 million. Mirvac said Tinkler's property development firm Buildev Group failed to meet a court-ordered payment for industrial land for a coal terminal.
