 DETROIT  (Reuters) - A group of 20 funds, which hold a total of $1 billion in Chrysler LLC debt, said on Thursday that it is in talks with the U.S. Treasury and has made a new offer on reducing the automaker's debt. 

 "We are continuing to discuss our position with the United States Treasury," the group said in a statement. "We have made a proposal which we earnestly believe is fair and would appropriately recognize our legal position." Chrysler will file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy Thursday after talks to restructure its debt with bondholders collapsed, a U.S. government official said. Chrysler has failed so far to gain the bondholder support it needed to move forward with a restructuring and avoid the first-ever bankruptcy filing by a major U.S. automaker. "We have a fiduciary responsibility to all those teachers, pensioners, retirees and others who have entrusted their money to us," the bondholder group said. "Much as we empathize with Chrysler's other stakeholders, the capital is just not ours to contribute to their cause by accepting a deal that is outside the well established legal framework and cannot be rationalized as being commercially reasonable."
