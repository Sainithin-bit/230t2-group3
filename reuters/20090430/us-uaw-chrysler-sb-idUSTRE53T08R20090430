 ETROIT  (Reuters) - Early tallies from a United Auto Workers vote on Wednesday on a modified labor contract with Chrysler LLC showed workers approving the deal with the struggling U.S. automaker by a large margin. 

 Chrysler, 80 percent-controlled by private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management LP, has until the end of Thursday to conclude deals to slash its debt and labor costs, and consummate an alliance with Italian automaker Fiat SpA. Failure to do so would mean the company will not have access to further emergency U.S. government funding and possibly face bankruptcy. The company and the UAW reached a tentative deal at the weekend, which had to go to Chrysler's 26,800 unionized workers for ratification votes that were concluding late on Wednesday. Chrysler's 8,000 Canadian Auto Workers union-represented workers have already ratified a new concessionary deal. Workers at a stamping plant in Twinsburg, Ohio represented by UAW Local 122 voted 88 percent in favor of a modified labor contract, the local said. According to the most recent data available, there are 1,250 UAW-represented workers at the plant, represented by UAW Local 122, which said its members voted for the deal, and UAW Local 573. It was not immediately clear how many workers at the plant are represented by Local 122. UAW Local 136 president Jerry Dennison said 78 percent of the workers represented by his local who had voted had backed the contract changes. About 1,500 workers were eligible to vote, but Dennison did not say how many had cast ballots. Local 136 represents workers at a Dodge Ram plant in St Louis. A worker at UAW Local 685, which represents workers at several plants, which, according to the most recent data available, represent around 4,500 workers, said 85 percent of workers had approved the modified contract. The worker declined to give his name and no official confirmation of that tally could be immediately obtained.
