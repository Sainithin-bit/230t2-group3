 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Chrysler LLC will file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy Thursday after talks to restructure its debt with bondholders collapsed, a U.S. government official said. 

 Chrysler failed to gain the bondholder support it needed to move forward with a restructuring and avoid the first-ever bankruptcy filing by a major U.S. automaker. COMMENTS BILL KOHLDER, CO-CHAIR, BUTZEL LONG'S GLOBAL AUTOMOTIVE PRACTICE "If there's a filing by Chrysler today, it will create a great deal of uncertainty for the industry and suppliers. The administration is hoping for a very quick reorganization but everyone in the industry should be prepared for a lengthy process given the complexity of the industry." "The supply chain is in significant distress and this will only compound their problems." "Chrysler's bankruptcy should be a wake-up call for GM bondholders failing to align in support of GM's restructuring outside of bankruptcy. It should help them realize the importance of their concessions." BRIAN DOLAN, CHIEF CURRENCY STRATEGIST, FOREX.COM,  BEDMINSTER, NEW JERSEY "It comes down to how quickly and in how orderly a fashion they can move out of it. If it happens in relatively short order, it may have less of an impact on the economy. But we have another month to go until GM faces a similar deadline, and overall, the impact is potentially severe when you factor in the number of dealers and suppliers that will be affected. "We are already looking at nine-week factory closings at GM. That's a real threat to the economy." BRIAN BETHUNE, U.S. ECONOMIST, IHS GLOBAL INSIGHT, WALTHAM, MASSACHUSETTS "It's almost a death wish that people want to execute. It's not easy to thread the eye of the needle, coming out on the other side of bankruptcy. There's a lot of capacity in the auto sector. These cram-down agreements could ultimately become untenable for some bondholders and holders of some these credit default swaps even in the event of a bankruptcy. "Bankruptcy will damage the Chrysler brand and that is regrettable. The government has to think carefully about how long they can bleed Chrysler out. They need to bring some fresh blood there to lead this company." LARRY CHLEBINA, FUND MANAGER AND PRINCIPAL OF CHLEBINA CAPITAL IN AKRON, OHIO. FUNDS OWN SOME GM BONDS. On what will happen in a bankruptcy proceeding: "The judge will probably cram down the agreement that was already on the table that they rejected." On what a Chrysler bankruptcy will mean for GM: "Unfortunately it probably illustrates the problem of getting the bondholders to accept a lesser deal than what they think they think they could get in bankruptcy, especially if they have insured with credit default swaps. MARINO MARIN, INVESTMENT BANKER AND MANAGING DIRECTOR GRUPPO, LEVEY & CO. IN NEW YORK. "The Fiat alliance is going to go ahead. No question. Bankruptcy is not an obstacle to the alliance." What happens in bankruptcy? "Most likely the judge will go with the deal that has already been accepted by 70 percent of the lenders." JEFF KLEINTOP, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST AT LPL FINANCIAL,  BOSTON "We're moving closer toward figuring out what that deal ultimately looks like. The certainty of even a bankruptcy is better than the uncertainty of not knowing where this is going to go or how deep the cuts or layoffs might end up being. The fact that it's moving toward bankruptcy, the range of possibilities is being narrowed and the market always prefers certainty over uncertainty, even if it means the certainty of a negative outcome. The market is looking forward for the first time in quite a long time, and so the near-term issues around what happens with the automakers, or even the stress tests with the banks, have taken back seat to a bigger picture view by the American investor." DAVID RESLER, CHIEF ECONOMIST, NOMURA SECURITIES, NEW YORK: "The agreement that seems to be nearing completion for GM ... probably means that debt holders are probably going to prefer the bankruptcy route. "The legal status of Chrysler is not particularly relevant. What is relevant is whether it's going to be a viable and ongoing enterprise and it sounds like this will enable them to do that. So if that's the case, then it won't have a very significant impact (on the broader economy). To a large extent the impact is already out there." ANDREW KANALY, CHAIRMAN, KANALY TRUST COMPANY "If it ends up being bankruptcy, why have we wasted all our time? Has the government's political process been of any benefit at all other than to waste a lot of time and money, and do we have to suffer this for every other bankruptcy? "Bankruptcy is not new. It's been there all along. For some reason these days the government seems to be the only remedy when we have plenty of remedies available to us. "Maybe this is a pattern that we are going to see for maybe Ford, GM, maybe Bank of America, maybe Citi -- a whole lot of hand waving, a whole lot of talking, a whole lot of hand wringing, when the bottom line is -- the failed institutions, let them go and let's get on down the road. "It's no shocker. If you bought a Chrysler a year-ago you knew you had an issue. The American (consumers) have already voted with their feet by virtue of their purchases. They are driving down in their Honda." MIRKO MIKELIC, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, FIFTH THIRD BANK "I don't think anybody's surprised. Bankruptcy is what they have been headed for in the past several months. Chrysler was too small to survive on its own. The biggest concern now is that the different stakeholders will be able to make the tough decisions they need to make." "This is not going to be a quick process, not at all. There's going to be a lot of politics involved."
