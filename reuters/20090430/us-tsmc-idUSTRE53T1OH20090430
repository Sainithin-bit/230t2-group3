 TAIPEI  (Reuters) - TSMC ( 2330.TW ), the world's biggest contract chip maker, reported its weakest quarterly earnings in nearly eight years on Thursday as a slowing global economy hit demand for technology products. 

 But the chip foundry market, dominated by TSMC, UMC ( 2303.TW ) and Chartered CSMF.SI, is likely bottoming out, due partly to China's stimulus package that is seen supporting demand for computers, cellphones and flat-screen TVs. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC) ( TSM.N ), which counts U.S. Texas Instruments TXN.N and Nvidia ( NVDA.O ) among its major clients, said it booked a net profit of T$1.56 billion ($47 million) in January-March. Profit tumbled 94.5 percent from T$28.14 billion a year ago, but beat a consensus T$1.2 billion forecast of six analysts surveyed by Reuters. "As a result of deepening economic recession worldwide and customers' inventory adjustment, first quarter saw a sharp decline in demand for semiconductors across all applications," TSMC said in a statement. On Wednesday, cross-town rival UMC ( UMC.N ) posted a T$8.16 billion net loss for January-March but said it would return to profit in the current second quarter as wafer shipments more than double from those in January-March. ASE ( 2311.TW ) ( ASX.N ), the world's largest chip packager, and Taiwan's chip designer Mediatek ( 2454.TW ) also predicted a brighter second quarter. TSMC's results came as the Taipei stock market closed on Thursday. TSMC shares surged 7 percent to their daily limit and UMC shares also rose limit up, in line with the main TAIEX's  .TWII  rally on hopes of Chinese investment to the island.
