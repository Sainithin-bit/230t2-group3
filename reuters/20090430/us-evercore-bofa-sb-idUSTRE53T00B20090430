 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Evercore Partners Inc said on Wednesday it is buying Bank of America Corp's special fiduciary services division and establishing a new trust bank to expand its investment management business. 

 The investment banking boutique said it will establish Evercore Trust Co on May 1. The trust bank will have about $12.8 billion in assets under management and administration once Evercore completes its purchase of the Bank of America unit. The newly chartered national trust bank will focus on providing specialized investment management, independent fiduciary and trustee services to employee benefit plans of large companies. Bank of America's special fiduciary services team will join Evercore Trust Co. Special Fiduciary Services has served employee benefit plans sponsored by about half the companies in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, it said.
