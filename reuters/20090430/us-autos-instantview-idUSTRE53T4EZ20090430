 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Chrysler LLC will file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy Thursday after talks to restructure its debt with bondholders collapsed, a U.S. government official said. 

 Chrysler failed to gain the bondholder support it needed to move forward with a restructuring and avoid the first-ever bankruptcy filing by a major U.S. automaker. DAVID RESLER, CHIEF ECONOMIST, NOMURA SECURITIES, NEW YORK: "The agreement that seems to be nearing completion for GM ... probably means that debt holders are probably going to prefer the bankruptcy route. "The legal status of Chrysler is not particularly relevant. What is relevant is whether it's going to be a viable and ongoing enterprise and it sounds like this will enable them to do that. So if that's the case, then it won't have a very significant impact (on the broader economy). To a large extent the impact is already out there." ANDREW KANALY, CHAIRMAN, KANALY TRUST COMPANY "If it ends up being bankruptcy, why have we wasted all our time? Has the government's political process been of any benefit at all other than to waste a lot of time and money, and do we have to suffer this for every other bankruptcy? "Bankruptcy is not new. It's been there all along. For some reason these days the government seems to be the only remedy when we have plenty of remedies available to us. "Maybe this is a pattern that we are going to see for maybe Ford, GM, maybe Bank of America, maybe Citi -- a whole lot of hand waving, a whole lot of talking, a whole lot of hand wringing, when the bottom line is -- the failed institutions, let them go and let's get on down the road. "It's no shocker. If you bought a Chrysler a year-ago you knew you had an issue. The American (consumers) have already voted with their feet by virtue of their purchases. They are driving down in their Honda." MIRKO MIKELIC, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, FIFTH THIRD BANK "I don't think anybody's surprised. Bankruptcy is what they have been headed for in the past several months. Chrysler was too small to survive on its own. The biggest concern now is that the different stakeholders will be able to make the tough decisions they need to make." "This is not going to be a quick process, not at all. There's going to be a lot of politics involved." (Reporting by  Soyoung Kim , Pedro DaCosta,  Ellis Mnyandu )
