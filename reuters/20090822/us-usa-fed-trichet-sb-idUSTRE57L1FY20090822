 JACKSON HOLE, Wyoming  (Reuters) - European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet warned monetary policy makers from around the world on Saturday not to forget the lessons of a devastating financial crisis amid signs the worst of the storm has passed. 

 "Being 'intellectually and conceptually ready' means doing all that we can, in our own areas of responsibility, to prevent the repetition of such dramatic events," he told an annual Federal Reserve conference. "Now that we see some signs confirming that the real economy is starting to get out of the period of 'free fall' -- which does not mean at all that we do not have a very bumpy road ahead of us -- the largest mistake we could make would be to forget the importance and the urgency of this task," he said.
