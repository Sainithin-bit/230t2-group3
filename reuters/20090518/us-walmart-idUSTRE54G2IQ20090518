 PHILADELPHIA  (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc ( WMT.N ) is revamping the electronics departments in its stores to attract customers who previously shopped at the now defunct Circuit City Stores Inc, according to The Wall Street Journal. 

 The retailer's larger and more interactive electronics displays will begin arriving in stores on Monday, the newspaper said in its electronic edition. "Circuit City's business is up for grabs right now and we expect to get our share," Gary Severson, Wal-Mart's senior vice president of home entertainment, said in an interview with the newspaper. Wal-Mart executives said the stores would soon offer Palm Inc's PALM.O Pre smartphone, a highly anticipated gadget. The retailer also is adding to its selection of higher-end televisions by manufacturers Sony Corp( 6758.T )( SNE.N ) and Samsung Electronics Co, and broadening its array of movies, the newspaper said. Wal-Mart could not be immediately reached for comment. (Reporting by  Jessica Hall ; Editing by  Jan Paschal )
