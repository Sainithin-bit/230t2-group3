 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japan and the United States are set to 
allow private defense contractors to directly share and 
transfer information on defense technology, the Nikkei business 
daily said on Sunday. 

  The new system, which aims to increase the speed and 
efficiency of joint research and development, will first be 
applied to the missile defense system Tokyo and Washington are 
working on to ward off potential threats from North Korea.  According to the Nikkei, an agreement in principle was 
reached last month at a meeting of defense and foreign 
ministers from Japan and the United States in Washington, with 
a formal agreement due later this month.  Defense Ministry officials were not available for comment.  At present, Japan and the United States sign a memorandum 
of understanding for each joint research development project 
they undertake, with information passed between companies only 
through the government.  Under the new system, companies could conclude technical 
assistance agreements that would give them direct access to the 
other firm's databases.  The process is needed due to the increasing complexity of 
research and the vast amounts of information involved, a 
Defense Ministry official was quoted by the Nikkei as saying.  Japan speeded up implementation of its missile defense 
program after North Korea fired a volley of missiles last July, 
trucking its first PAC-3 interceptors into a military base 
north of Tokyo in March.  The United States has PAC-3 land-based interceptors on the 
southern island of Okinawa and SM-3 ship-to-air interceptors 
stationed at the Japanese port of Yokosuka.
