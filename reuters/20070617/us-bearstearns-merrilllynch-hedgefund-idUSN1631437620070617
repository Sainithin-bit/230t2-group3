 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Investment bank Merrill Lynch MER.N has seized $400 million in assets of a troubled hedge fund at Bear Stearns Cos. Inc. BSC.N and plans to sell them off, The Wall Street Journal reported in its weekend edition. 

 The report said Merrill Lynch had seized the assets of the High-Grade Structured Credit Strategies Enhanced Leveraged Fund, despite the sell-off by the fund's managers of nearly $4 billion in high-quality mortgage bonds to cover losses. The losses related to subprime mortgages. Bids for the seized assets are scheduled to be negotiated starting at noon EDT on Monday, the report said. Representatives of Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch could not be immediately reached for comment.
