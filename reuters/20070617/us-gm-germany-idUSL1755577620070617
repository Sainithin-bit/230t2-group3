 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - General Motors Corp ( GM.N ) aims to quadruple sales of its Chevrolet brand cars in Germany within seven years, the division's manager was quoted as saying on Sunday. 

 "In the next six to seven years we want to reach a sales level of 100,000 cars, Chevrolet Germany Managing Director Peter Sommer told Die Welt newspaper, according to a preview of its Monday edition. Chevrolet's European sales rose 15.6 percent in 2006 to more than 341,000 cars, including 23,132 in Germany, helping to push General Motors' overall European sales over the 2 million mark for the first time. Sommer said Chevrolet planned to increase the number of dealers in Germany over the next two years to between 350 and 360, from 300 now, and the number of outlets to 600, from 450.
