 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Wyeth posted slightly lower first-quarter earnings on Tuesday, hurt by the recent launch of generic forms of its Protonix ulcer drug, but surprisingly strong sales of other medicines enabled the company to beat Wall Street profit forecasts. 

 Wyeth earned $1.2 billion, or 89 cents per share, compared with $1.25 billion, or 92 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding special items, the drugmaker earned 94 cents per share. Analysts' average forecast was 90 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. "The earnings number was solid and came in above expectations; it's a good beginning for the year," said David Katz, chief investment officer of asset manager Matrix Asset Advisors in New York. Global revenue rose 6 percent to $5.71 billion, above the average Wall Street forecast of $5.49 billion. Excluding the favorable impact of the weak dollar, revenue rose just 1 percent. Wyeth reaffirmed it expects earnings to fall as much as 5 percent this year due to generic competition for Protonix and possible generic competition for its $3.5 billion-a-year Effexor anti-depressant. "Wyeth historically has been conservative, not raising its yearly estimates even when beating quarterly forecasts, and that seems to be the case now," Katz said. The Madison, New Jersey-based drugmaker said it expects Effexor sales, which grew 15 percent in the first quarter to $1 billion, to be comparable for the full year to those seen in 2007. Effexor sales will suffer later this year, Wyeth said, from competition with Wyeth's own recently approved newer depression drug, Pristiq, and the arrival in Europe of generic forms of Effexor. U.S. regulators in late February approved Pristiq, a derivative of Effexor the company aims to build into a major brand before Effexor loses its U.S. patent protection in 2010 and faces generic competition. $1 BILLION POTENTIAL "We think Pristiq, as a treatment for depression, has potential for sales exceeding $1 billion" annually, company Chief Financial Officer Greg Norden said in an interview. Some analysts have dismissed Pristiq as a "me too" drug, with few distinguishing characteristics and modest sales potential. But Norden said it may be simpler to use because most patients would take the same 50-milligram dose. To encourage patients to use it, Wyeth said on Tuesday it will price Pristiq at a 20 percent discount to Effexor. India's Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd is expected to begin shipping tablet forms of Effexor to U.S. drugstores in the second half of the year. But Wyeth said the tablets, because of their different formulation from Effexor, will not be rated as automatic substitutes for its brand. Protonix had been one of Wyeth's biggest products, with annual sales of more than $1.7 billion, until Israel's Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd introduced its generic version of the ulcer drug in December despite an unresolved patent dispute with Wyeth. In late January India's Sun aggravated Wyeth's pain by launching its own copycat version of Protonix in the United States. Consequently, Protonix sales fell by two-thirds in the first quarter, to $159 million. But other big Wyeth drugs had strong sales gains, including Enbrel for arthritis, Prevnar to prevent childhood infections, and the Premarin line of female hormone replacement drugs. Prevnar sales jumped 14 percent to $706 million, while sales of Enbrel, which Wyeth markets outside the United States and Canada, soared 36 percent to $606 million despite strong competition from similar products sold by Johnson & Johnson and Abbott Laboratories Inc. Premarin sales rose 15 percent to $276 million, continuing to recover somewhat from long-standing concerns that the drugs can increase the risk of breast cancer and stroke. Shares of Wyeth were down 45 cents, or 1 percent, at $43.76 in midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange amid a moderate downturn for the drug sector.
