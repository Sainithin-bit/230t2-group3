 LONDON  (Reuters) - Credit Suisse Group ( CSGN.VX ) is axing about 500 more jobs across its investment banking and shared services divisions, the Swiss bank said on Tuesday. 

 "Due to market conditions and projected staffing levels required to meet client needs, we are reducing global headcount by approximately 500 across our Investment Banking Division and Shared Services Division," it said in a statement. The bank declined to elaborate. The job losses are in addition to about 500 investment banking cuts made in January and 170 cuts in the same division announced in October, a source close to the bank said. The source said the cuts would be made across investment banking businesses, such as mergers and acquisitions, fixed income and equities trading. Financial companies including Citigroup ( C.N ), JPMorgan ( JPM.N ) and Lehman Brothers LEH.N have slashed a total of at least 70,000 jobs in the United States and Europe and further headcount reductions are expected by many in the markets.
