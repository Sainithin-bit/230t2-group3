 DHAKA  (Reuters) - Bangladesh Airline Biman has ordered eight planes worth $1.27 billion from U.S. aircraft maker Boeing ( BA.N ) to be delivered by 2020, officials said. 

 Boeing will supply four 777-300ER aircraft by 2013 and four 787-8s Dreamliner aircraft by 2020, according to a final deal signed on Tuesday. The airline also agreed to buy two more Boeing aircraft worth nearly $110 million by 2015 to boost flight frequency. The airline rejected a separate offer from Europe's Airbus ( EAD.PA ) to supply four aircraft from any of the A-320, A-321 and A-330 models. Boeing will supply the four 777-300ER aircraft by 2013 and the four Dreamliners between 2019 and 2020. "We will also buy two Boeing 737-800 aircraft with the price nearly $55 million for each plane," Mahbub Jamil, chairman of Biman told a news conference. Boeing has pledged to supply the two 737-800 aircraft by 2015, another Biman official said. Biman, which will fund the purchase through bank loans, became a public limited company in July, still 100 percent state-owned, as part of rescue plan by the country's army-backed interim government. "We are extremely happy on the order and decision to buy more aircraft from our company," said Marty A. Bentrott, a senior vice president of Boeing. Biman was forced to halt its flights to New York, Paris, Tokyo, Frankfurt, Brussels, Yangon and Mumbai in 2006 due to a shortage of funds and aircraft. Bangladeshi Biman plans to modernise and expand its fleet to enable it to reopen the routes it had to close, Jamil said. To meet immediate needs, Biman will lease two aircraft to reopen its Dhaka-London-New York route. It flies 19 international routes with a fleet of 11 aircraft, but faces competition from four smaller, local private airlines, one of which has extended its operations to include regional routes connecting the Bangladeshi capital Dhaka to Kuala Lumpur, Singapore, Delhi and Dubai.
