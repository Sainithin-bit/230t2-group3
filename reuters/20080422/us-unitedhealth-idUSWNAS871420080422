 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Health insurer UnitedHealth Group Inc ( UNH.N ) posted a lower-than-expected first-quarter profit on Tuesday, hurt by weakness in its business serving employers, and slashed its full-year earnings forecast, sending its shares to their lowest level since 2004. 

 The gloomy outlook from the largest U.S. health insurer by market value -- which cited both broad factors and company missteps -- became the latest hit to confidence in the industry. Shares of rivals Aetna Inc ( AET.N ), WellPoint Inc ( WLP.N ) and Cigna Corp also fell about 4 percent. Although prior UnitedHealth comments had girded investors for a forecast cut, analysts said the 10 percent reduction was worse than expected. "This is nowhere near what we thought; this is much worse," said David Heupel, a portfolio manager with Thrivent Investment Management. "For the industry bellwether to come out and cut numbers to that extent is significantly bad." The lower outlook stemmed largely from weaker revenue growth and margins for its commercial plans for employers and Medicare plans for the elderly. UnitedHealth cut membership forecasts in both areas. The Minneapolis-based company, whose shares fell as much as 11.5 percent, also said industry competition for membership growth is taking a toll on its enrollment. Furthermore, a weak U.S. economy is causing customers to seek leaner benefits that produce less revenue and companies to cut jobs that reduce membership. The company is being hurt to a lesser degree by high costs from the flu and reduced investment income. UnitedHealth Chief Executive Officer Stephen Hemsley said the results were "not acceptable" and they were due "in part to our own performance." UnitedHealth, whose report kicks off earnings season for the industry, is the latest health insurer to lower its 2008 forecast since March. At the time, WellPoint, the largest U.S. health insurer by membership, stunned the market by cutting its outlook. While several health insurers have since warned about their 2008 prospects, some companies have said their problems are contained while others like UnitedHealth and WellPoint blamed multiple issues. Analysts are divided over whether these profit warnings represent company-specific problems or evidence of a broad industry downturn. "I think we'll see better reports coming out of some of the peers in the next week or two, but there's no question that there's some macro-economic concerns that are going to impact everybody in this industry," Heupel said. UnitedHealth posted first-quarter net income of $994 million, or 78 cents per share, compared with $927 million, or 66 cents per share, a year earlier. Analysts on average expected 80 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue rose 7 percent to $20.3 billion. The company served medical benefits to about 32.4 million people as of the end of March, up about 5 percent from a year ago, helped by its acquisitions of Fiserv and Sierra Health Services. But excluding acquisitions, membership fell sharply for its commercial plans for which it assumes full insurance risk. It expects such membership to fall by about 700,000 this year. UnitedHealth said it was refusing to cut premium pricing to compete with other plans, hurting its growth. "The market is so competitive it's hard to have pricing keep up with (medical) cost trends, so businesses like United seem to be walking away from some of the lower-margin parts of the business," said Tim Nelson, a senior healthcare analyst with First American Funds. "That's going to mean very little growth for the industry." The company's operating costs also jumped to 14.3 percent of revenue, 1.2 percentage points higher than a year earlier. It said it incurred those costs to support business that failed to materialize and said it would selectively pare back expenses throughout the year. Further, the company said its Medicare business is shifting toward less profitable products, and lowered its membership forecast for full-service Medicare Advantage plans. UnitedHealth is one of the largest U.S. providers of Medicare plans. One bright spot has been its Medicaid business serving low-income Americans, which grew revenues by 23 percent to $1.2 billion. The company said on Tuesday it won a Medicaid contract in Tennessee that will add $1 billion in revenue next year. The company reduced its 2008 outlook by 40 cents per share to a range of $3.55 to $3.60 per share, reflecting growth of as much as 5 percent. Analysts expected $3.86 per share. On a conference call to discuss the results, investors urged the company to consider actions potentially friendly to shareholders, including a cash dividend or divesting its non-insurance businesses, such as its pharmacy services unit. Shares of UnitedHealth fell $4.09, or 10.8 percent, to $33.72 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. They earlier fell as low as $33.48, their lowest price in more than three years. UnitedHealth shares have tumbled 42 percent this year, while the Morgan Stanley Healthcare Payor index .HMO is off 36 percent this year.
