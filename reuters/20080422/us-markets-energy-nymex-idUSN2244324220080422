 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. crude oil futures surged to a record above $119 on Tuesday as the weak dollar and Nigerian and U.K. supply snags continued to lift crude and refined products futures to record highs. 

 "The trend is up and the market didn't break down when it moved lower in the morning, and you have the weak dollar and the supply disruptions are in the mix," said Eric Wittenauer, analyst at Wachovia Securities. On the New York Mercantile Exchange at 12:17 p.m. EDT, May crude was up $1.96 or 1.67 percent at $119.44 a barrel, trading from $116.85 to a record $119.74, surging past Monday's $117.83 record peak. The May contract expires on Tuesday. In London, the front-month June Brent crude contract was up $1.81 or 1.58 percent at $116.24 a barrel, trading from $113.94 to $116.75.

The euro rallied against the dollar and traded above $1.60 for the first time since its 1999 inception amid growing expectations the European Central Bank's next move may be a hike in benchmark interest rates. Royal Dutch Shell ( RDSa.L ) said on Tuesday it stands by its previous statement that 169,000 barrels per day of Nigerian output were shut, responding after Nigeria's oil minister said the figure was too high.
