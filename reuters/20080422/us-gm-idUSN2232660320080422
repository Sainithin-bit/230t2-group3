 DETROIT  (Reuters) - General Motors Corp ( GM.N ), whose production of the hot-selling Malibu sedan could be disrupted by a strike this week, now faces a possible United Auto Workers strike at an Ohio stamping plant next week. 

 GM, the No. 1 U.S. automaker, has idled about 30 plants due to parts shortages from a UAW strike at a key supplier, and UAW strikes and threats of strikes at GM plants where local agreements have yet to be completed following a master contract the union and GM negotiated last year. A UAW local representing workers at a GM stamping plant in Mansfield, Ohio, has given GM notice of a strike deadline next week, GM spokesman Dan Flores said on Tuesday. That notice comes just days before UAW workers at GM's Fairfax, Kansas, assembly plant could strike in a walkout that would disrupt production of the hot-selling Chevrolet Malibu, a sedan seen as crucial to the automaker's lineup. UAW Local 31 in Kansas could strike as early as 3:30 pm CT/4:30 pm ET Thursday, President Jeff Manning said. GM and the local remain in daily negotiations, he said. The Fairfax plant is the primary site for production of the newly redesigned Malibu that GM has targeted as a competitor to the Toyota ( 7203.T ) Camry and Honda ( 7267.T ) Accord sedans. GM also builds the Saturn Aura sedan at the plant. GM also produces the Malibu at its Orion assembly plant in Michigan, where it builds the Pontiac G6. The UAW has already reached a local agreement with GM at the Orion facility. About 3,650 UAW-represented workers went on strike February 26 at five American Axle & Manufacturing Holdings Inc ( AXL.N ) plants in the United States. The strike quickly forced GM to cut production due to parts shortages. The production disruptions mainly had affected GM's production of large sport-utility vehicles and pickup trucks that have been selling slowly because of the U.S. economic downturn and high fuel prices. However, more recent strikes and threats of stoppages have affected GM vehicles that have continued to sell well in the downturn: crossover SUVs built on car platforms that are more nimble than traditional SUVs built on truck platforms. UAW workers went on strike Thursday at the Delta Township plant near Lansing, Michigan, idling production of the Buick Enclave, Saturn Outlook and GMC Acadia crossovers. A local representing workers at a metal fabricating plant in Grand Rapids, Michigan, could strike GM as early as Friday, while a UAW local representing workers at a GM transmission plant in Warren, Michigan, has negotiated beyond a deadline.
