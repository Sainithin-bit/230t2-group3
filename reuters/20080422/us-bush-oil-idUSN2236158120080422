 NEW ORLEANS  (Reuters) - President George W. Bush on Tuesday said he was concerned about record-high crude oil and gasoline prices, and said the United States needs to tap an Alaskan wildlife refuge to boost supply. 

 "I am obviously concerned for our consumers," Bush said at a news conference along with Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper and Mexican President Felipe Calderon. Before he spoke, U.S. crude prices had hit an all-time peak of $119.90. Average U.S. gasoline prices this week hit a record $3.51 a gallon at the pump, according to U.S. government figures, with prices in some West Coast cities like San Francisco surging past $4. Bush declined a reporter's request to comment on whether big OPEC producers like Saudi Arabia were coming to the aid of U.S. consumers, but heaped praise on Canada and Mexico - consistently among the top five U.S. suppliers. "Fortunately Canada and Mexico are our biggest providers, for which we are grateful," Bush said. Bush reiterated his call for the U.S. Congress to overturn a long-standing moratorium on drilling for oil in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR), home to wildlife like polar bears and migratory birds. "We should have been exploring for oil in ANWR," Bush said. "As a result we are dependent on foreign sources of oil." (Writing by  Chris Baltimore ; Editing by  David Gregorio )
