 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - UAL Corp UAUA.O, parent of United Airlines, said on Tuesday its quarterly net loss more than tripled on soaring fuel costs, and the company announced a new cost savings target and job cuts to offset that expense. 

 UAL said it lost $537 million, or $4.45 per share in the first quarter, compared with $152 million, or $1.32 per share, a year earlier. It was by far the biggest net loss reported by a major airline for the first quarter. The company reported operating revenue of $4.71 billion, up from $4.37 billion a year earlier. The U.S. airline industry has been grappling with soaring fuel prices and a softening economy. UAL, which completed a massive bankruptcy restructuring in 2006, said its consolidated fuel bill rose $618 million in the quarter. The company ended the quarter with an unrestricted cash and short-term investment balance of $2.9 billion. UAL said it is targeting $200 million in non-fuel cost savings in addition to the $200 million announced earlier in the year. The cost cuts will require reducing UAL's salaried and management work force by 500 employees and its unionized work force by about 600 employees by the end of 2008. The 1,100 job cuts represent about 2 percent of the companies total work force of 55,221 as reported on the UAL Web site. UAL also is reducing capital expenditures by about $200 million from $650 million as previously planned and cutting capacity. (Reporting by Kyle Peterson, editing by Dave Zimmerman) h
