 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - CME Group Inc CME.N, parent of the world's largest derivatives exchange, on Tuesday posted a lower-than-expected profit on thinner profit margins, and questions about fallout from the global credit crunch helped send shares down nearly 11 percent. 

 Chief Executive Craig Donohue cited a "challenging environment" for many CME customers, and Chief Financial Officer Jamie Parisi said higher trading margins imposed because of extreme market volatility may also be lowering activity from some traders. Still, CME officials said that the process of "deleveraging," or reducing credit risk, under way as financial firms shed counterparty exposure should not crimp derivatives volume growth in the quarters ahead. CME's first-quarter net income rose to $284 million, or $5.25 per share, from $130 million, or $3.69 per share, a year ago. Excluding a benefit from a change in state tax laws, CME earned $4.67 a share, below the average Wall Street estimate of $4.83 a share as compiled by Reuters Estimates. Revenue rose to $625 million, missing the average analysts' forecast of $630 million. Edward Ditmire, analyst at Fox Pitt Kelton, called the plunge an "exaggerated response" to the earnings miss. "This just isn't a stock that people are used to see miss earnings targets," he added. Much of the earnings miss reflected lower investment income, a result of lower U.S. interest rates, and higher non-operating expenses. Still, CME officials were quizzed about a drop in year-on-year open interest for Eurodollar contracts, its biggest single product line. Open interest can be a leading indicator of trading volume going forward. If it shrinks, CME's years-long run of aggressive volume growth -- the foundation of analysts' earnings forecasts -- could also be at risk. Still, company officials played down the threat. "We are not seeing much business being lost because of credit problems," CME Chairman Terry Duffy told Reuters in an interview. "On the contrary, customers are coming to us because of the transparency we offer." Donohue said CME's mix of customers immunized the exchange against a slowdown from any one sector, and added that the exchange was targeting more marketing efforts toward rapidly growing sovereign wealth funds. "We've seen a flight to quality where people are turning to a centrally-cleared market ... and that's offsetting a deleveraging of banks' balance sheets," he said. CME's average rate per contract (RPC), a key measure of margins, fell by 2.7 percent to 63.0 cents from 64.8 cents in the fourth quarter of 2007 and 64.0 cents a year earlier. Parisi said the lower rate represented faster growth in volume from members, who pay lower fees to trade than do non-members. First-quarter derivatives trading volume was previously reported at 13.7 million contracts per day, up 32 percent, but volume in March alone was up only 15 percent. "The near-term could be slightly challenging until volumes accelerate from current levels," Christopher Allen, analyst at Bank of America, said in a research note. CME Group average daily volume had six-year compounded growth of 27 percent. CME is set to acquire NYMEX, the energy and precious metals mart, for about $9.4 billion, subject to shareholder and regulatory approval. Duffy dismissed press reports that some NYMEX shareholders would pressure CME to raise its offer, saying that it had a definitive agreement with NYMEX. The company's shares were down more than 10 percent, or $56.29, at $467.21, in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
