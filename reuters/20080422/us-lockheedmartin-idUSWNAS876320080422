 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Lockheed Martin Corp ( LMT.N ) said on Tuesday quarterly profit rose 6 percent, helped by higher sales of its electronic, information and space systems. 

 The world's largest defense contractor, which also runs a host of civil projects for the U.S. government, reported first-quarter profit of $730 million, or $1.75 per share, compared with $690 million, or $1.60 per share, in the year-ago quarter.
