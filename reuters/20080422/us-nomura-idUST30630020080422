 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Nomura Holdings ( 8604.T ), Japan's largest brokerage house, said on Tuesday that it had fired an employee at the centre of an insider trading ring and warned the fallout could harm its business. 

 The insider trading scandal, the broker's second in five years, comes on top of falling profits and $1.4 billion in subprime losses, after which the firm replaced its CEO. Recently appointed CEO Kenichi Watanabe bowed in apology for the scandal, which drew harsh comments from government officials and sent the firm's share price down 3.9 percent. It also led to a drop-off in business at the firm on Tuesday as some institutional investors stopped placing orders due to compliance concerns, a source on the Nomura trading floor said. Watanabe said the employee at the centre of the probe had been dismissed for violating company rules and warned the case would have an unspecified impact on earnings. "We are sorry for failing to contribute to a fair market, as a company that deals with the brokerage industry," he said. "It was significant that we were involved in something that hurt the brokerage industry," he said, adding he saw the case as an individual matter, rather than a sign of wider problems at his firm. The employee at the centre of the scandal worked in the M&A advisory department where he repeatedly used insider information about merger and acquisition deals, a source with direct knowledge of the matter said. The 30-year old, from Nomura's Hong Kong unit, was suspected of giving information on merger deals to two acquaintances who then profited on stock trades, Kyodo News agency said. LIMITED IMPACT SEEN "We are not very busy today because of the stopped orders," a Nomura stocks sales trader said, but analysts said they saw little lasting impact on the firm's business and stock price from its latest woes. "Clients can't really avoid Nomura as it's by far the biggest M&A broker in Japan," said Tatsuo Majima, an analyst at Deutsche Securities. "Some companies with strict compliance rules may reduce dealings with Nomura, but that won't lead to any prominent decline in its businesses or earnings." Tumbling Japanese stocks over the past year have cut into broking commissions and delayed lucrative M&A deals and share offerings, hitting Japanese brokerage houses, including Nomura. As well, it has reported around 140 billion yen ($1.4 billion) in losses on U.S. mortgage-backed securities. <ID:nT185250> Those problems have seen the broker's shares slide 32 percent in the past year, underperforming a nearly one-quarter fall by the benchmark Nikkei share average  .N225 . Nomura stock fell 3.9 percent on Tuesday to 1,639 yen, underperforming a weak securities sector .ISECU.T that fell 3.6 percent and a 1.1 percent fall in the Nikkei. Nomura handled $24.8 billion worth of M&A deals for Japanese companies in the year to March, grabbing about a 19 percent market share, data from Thomson Financial showed. "It's outrageous for any employee at a large securities brokerage to engage in insider trading," Japanese Financial Services Minister Yoshimi Watanabe told reporters. "We'll deal strictly with any criminal act." LURED TO TOKYO The employee under investigation was lured to Tokyo from Hong Kong on Monday on the pretence of a business trip, the source with direct knowledge of the matter said. Kyodo News said he had since been interviewed by the regulator and would be arrested soon. Credit Suisse analyst Azuma Ohno said the response by Nomura would be important to limiting fallout from the scandal. "It all boils down to the issue of what the company should do about its internal and information management structure," Ohno said, although he played down the risk of ongoing damage. The employee, a Chinese national, leaked M&A information to two Chinese acquaintances, the Nikkei business daily said. The three allegedly used internal information about M&A deals and bids handled by Nomura Securities to trade shares of two listed companies in 2006 and 2007, the Nikkei said. The paper also said the three traded shares of 19 other companies for which the corporate information division handled bids and M&A deals. The paper did not name the affected firms. A Nomura Securities official was prosecuted by the securities watchdog in 2003 for insider trading related to a bid for a unit of defunct trading house Nichimen, which is now known as Sojitz ( 2768.T ).
