 LONDON  (Reuters) - U.S.-based buyout firm Warburg Pincus WP.UL said on Tuesday it closed a new $15 billion fund as it seeks opportunities to invest worldwide. 

 The buyout firm said it plans to invest cash from the fund in Europe, the United States and Asia, adding that such a worldwide strategy allows it to find opportunities despite the credit crunch, which has slowed down activity in western Europe and the U.S. "We have a time-tested approach -- growth investing in growth-oriented regions," said Joseph Landy, Co-President of Warburg Pincus, in a statement. "This is a particularly attractive investment strategy in the current environment." (Reporting by  Mathieu Robbins , editing by Elizabeth Fullerton)
