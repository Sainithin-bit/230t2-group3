 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. crude oil futures rose more than $2 a barrel to a record above $119 on Tuesday as the dollar kept sliding against the euro and Nigerian and U.K. supply snags helped lift the oil complex. 

 On the New York Mercantile Exchange at 11:56 a.m. EDT, May crude was up $2.02, or 1.72 percent, at $119.50 a barrel, trading from $116.85 to a record $119.74, moving past Monday's $117.83 record peak. (Reporting by  Robert Gibbons )
