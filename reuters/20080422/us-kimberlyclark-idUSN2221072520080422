 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Kimberly-Clark Corp posted lower quarterly profit on Tuesday, hurt by higher interest expense. 

 But the weak dollar helped boost overseas sales, and price increases helped mitigate rising costs, the company said. The maker of Huggies diapers and Kleenex tissues said first-quarter profit was $440.9 million, down from $452 million a year earlier. Earnings per share rose to $1.04 from 98 cents because of a decline in the number of shares outstanding. Sales rose 9.7 percent to $4.81 billion. Like many consumer products companies, Kimberly-Clark has raised prices to help offset rising commodity costs. (Reporting by  Brad Dorfman ; editing by John Wallace)
