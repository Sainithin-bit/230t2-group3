 SYDNEY  (Reuters) - Rio Tinto said on Friday that it was surprised at allegations made by Chinese authorities relating to employees arrested in Shanghai. 

 "Rio Tinto is following developments very closely," a company spokesman said. "The group is surprised by the allegations and is not aware of any evidence that would support these allegations." Chinese authorities on Sunday arrested four Rio Tinto employees, including top iron ore salesman in China, Australian Stern Hu, alleging they were involved in stealing state secrets. The affair has cast a shadow over Australia-China relations.
