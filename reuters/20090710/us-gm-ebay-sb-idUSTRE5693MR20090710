 DETROIT  (Reuters) - General Motors will test a partnership with eBay Inc in California that allows customers to bid on vehicles or buy them at a predetermined price online, GM said on Friday. 

 "We'll be testing this and other ideas with our dealers over the next few weeks and hope to expand and build upon them in the coming months," GM Chief Executive Fritz Henderson said in a statement. A new GM emerged from bankruptcy on Friday. The company is reducing its white-collar work force and its dealership network. (Reporting by  David Bailey )
