 LONDON  (Reuters) - New Barclays chief executive Antony Jenkins said achieving his goals of becoming the "go to" bank for customers will require fast and bold change in how the business operates. 
 Jenkins said in a memo to staff seen by Reuters that Barclays had made serious mistakes in recent years and needs to change. "Getting there will require nothing short of the transformation of how we operate the business," he said in the memo. Much of the work was under way, Jenkins said, adding: "we need to move faster, more boldly and be even more joined up in executing it". Outgoing chairman Marcus Agius said in a memo to staff that after interviewing short-listed candidates the board's decision to appoint Jenkins was unanimous.
