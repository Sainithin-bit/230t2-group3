 JOHANNESBURG  (Reuters) - South African fixed-line operator Telkom SA ( TKGJ.J ) said on Thursday it would appeal a $55 million regulatory fine imposed for using its dominant market position to stifle potential competitors. 
 South Africa's competition regulator this month slapped Telkom with a lighter-than-expected fine of 449 million rand ($55 million) over a longstanding complaint it blocked competition from other network service providers. Telkom said in a statement it had filed notice that it would appeal the ruling. It will have 40 days to file the appeal, it said. (Reporting by  David Dolan ; Editing by  Jon Herskovitz )
