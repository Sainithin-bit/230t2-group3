 BERLIN  (Reuters) - A new aid package for Greece could cost more than 100 billion euros ($144 billion), German news magazine Der Spiegel said in its latest issue to appear on Monday. 

 The magazine said experts from the German Finance Ministry and the "troika" of the EU, IMF and European Central Bank consider it possible that Greece would need roughly that amount if it still needs to rely on foreign aid in 2013 and 2014. The German finance ministry declined to comment on the report. Greece's original EU/IMF bailout agreed a year ago was for 110 billion euros, with Germany's portion amounting to 24.4 billion euros. Greece is expected to need a second aid package of some 65 billion euros but the cost of a second package could rise to more than 100 billion euros, Der Spiegel said, because Greek government bonds will need follow-up financing in 2014. The report also said that German finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble banned his deputy Joerg Asmussen from agreeing to any second rescue package that does not include the participation of private creditors.
