 LONDON  (Reuters) - Two more investment banks have joined the army of advisers lined up by the world's biggest mining group, BHP Billiton ( BHP.AX ), and its takeover target Rio Tinto ( RIO.AX ) this week, according to regulatory filings. 

 Deutsche Bank ( DBKGn.DE ) started to reveal daily dealings in BHP ( BLT.L ) and Rio ( RIO.L ) shares on Tuesday because it is advising Rio, and UBS ( UBSN.VX ) began to publish trading in the companies on the same day as an adviser to BHP. Banks have rushed for a role in what would be the world's second-largest takeover to secure a top place on the advisory league tables. Rio has rejected BHP's proposed all-share offer, worth $140 billion when first announced, as being too low. BHP already has advisers Citigroup ( C.N ), Goldman Sachs ( GS.N ), Australian investment bank Gresham Partners and HSBC ( HSBA.L )( 0005.HK ) as well as Merrill Lynch MER.N as corporate broker to the company. Credit Suisse ( CSGN.VX ), JP Morgan ( JPM.N ), Macquarie MBL.AX, Morgan Stanley MWD.N and Rothschild ROT.UL are all advising Rio Tinto. (Editing by Quentin Bryar)
