 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Buyout firm Cerberus Capital Management said on Wednesday it was taking legal action to ensure United Rentals Inc ( URI.N ) honors the terms of a deal the pair struck in July, which Cerberus says caps its liability at $100 million. 

 Cerberus pulled its takeover offer for United Rentals of $34.50 per share, or $4 billion, last Wednesday. United Rentals said on Monday that it filed a lawsuit seeking to force Cerberus to complete the deal. Cerberus said in a statement on Wednesday that it filed an action for a declaratory judgment against United Rentals in New York State Supreme Court seeking "to ensure that United Rentals honors" undertakings made at the time of the deal.
