 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - United Rentals Inc ( URI.N ) said on Wednesday it wanted a $4 billion takeover deal that buyout firm Cerberus pulled out of last week enforced. 

 "Cerberus' attempt to pay the $100 million reverse break-up fee and simply walk away is a direct violation of the merger agreement," said a spokesman in an e-mailed statement. "We want the merger agreement enforced and we want it enforced in its entirety." United Rentals said on Monday that it filed a lawsuit seeking to force Cerberus to complete the deal. Cerberus said in a statement earlier on Wednesday that it filed an action for a declaratory judgment against United Rentals in New York State Supreme Court seeking "to ensure that United Rentals honors" undertakings made at the time of the deal.
