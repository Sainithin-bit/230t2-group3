 LONDON  (Reuters) - The chief executive of bid target Scottish & Newcastle (S&N) SCTN.L, John Dunsmore, is set to brief analysts and media on Friday on his defense against a bid by rival brewers Carlsberg ( CARLb.CO ) and Heineken ( HEIN.AS ). 

 Dunsmore, who only took over at the helm of Britain's biggest brewer on Nov 1, bolstered the group's defense by moving on Tuesday to cut costs and stress the bid undervalues its 50 percent stake in fast-growing Baltic Beverages Holding (BBH), but this was undermined by a warning of poor current trading. "We are largely repeating Tuesday's presentation because of the strength of interest from media and analysts," said an S&N spokesman. The presentation will take place in Copenhagen at 2:30 a.m. EST, Friday Nov 23. The joint bid by Denmark's Carlsberg and Dutch Heineken at 750 pence a share cash bid values S&N at 7.3 billion pounds ($15.1 billion) or 9.7 billion including debt, but Dunsmore says the bid undervalues the company, brewer of Foster's, Kronenbourg and Newcastle Brown Ale. This is despite the current S&N share price being below the bid price. It was last unchanged at 725-1/2p by 6:15 a.m. EST. Dunsmore will outline S&N's arbitration case against the joint owner of BBH, Carlsberg, claiming the Danish brewer has broken the BBH agreement and S&N should be offered Carlsberg's 50 percent share in the joint venture, which operates in the former Soviet Union. S&N's third biggest investor, Legal & General, which owns about 4.5 percent of the Edinburgh-based brewer, this week called on Carlsberg to reveal key details on the prospects for BBH to allow it to assess the takeover bid fully, details which S&N is eager to share with its investors. "We support the call for greater transparency on BBH so as to be in a position to fully evaluate the bid," Mark Burgess, head of active equities at Legal & General Investment Management, said on Wednesday. S&N's defense strategy calls for cost cuts of 20 million pounds a year by closing a bottling plant at its Reading brewery in southern England and outsourcing some of its beer volume, which is expected to lead to the closure of Reading and move production to a nearby Molson Coors ( TAP.N ) brewery.
