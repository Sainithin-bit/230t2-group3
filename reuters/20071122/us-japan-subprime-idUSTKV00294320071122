 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japan's large banks had about 1.2 trillion yen ($11 billion) invested in products related to the U.S. subprime mortgage market as of the end of September, Japan's financial regulator said on Thursday. 

 The estimate from the Financial Services Agency comes a day after Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc (MUFG) ( 8306.T ), Japan's largest lender, reported its first-half earnings. Japan's three biggest banks -- the so-called "megabanks" -- have more than 460 billion yen in subprime exposure, according to their first-half earnings results. Although Japanese lenders have fewer investments in securities related to risky U.S. mortgages than overseas rivals, they have not escaped the subprime turmoil unscathed. The credit crisis has forced them to write down the value of subprime-related holdings and other assets. The FSA said large lenders had booked 100 billion yen in subprime-related losses as of the end of September. MUFG posted a 49 percent drop in first-half profit on subprime woes, while second-ranked Mizuho Financial Group Inc ( 8411.T ) saw its profit fall 17 percent. Third-ranked Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group ( 8316.T ) reported a 30 percent decline in first-half profit. (Reporting by Reiji Murai; Writing by  David Dolan )
