 STUTTGART  (Reuters) - A takeover of Germany's BASF AG BASF.DE is not impossible, the chief executive of the world's largest chemicals company by sales said. 

 "BASF is not that big that it can't be taken over," Juergen Hambrecht told reporters in Stuttgart late on Wednesday. At 4:30 a.m. EST, BASF shares were up 1.1 percent at 92.40 euros, giving it a market value of around 45 billion euros ($67 billion). According to Standard & Poor's, BASF is rated AA- with a stable outlook -- the highest among European chemicals. In the past, there had been market talk of a possible bid from U.S. rivals like Dow Chemical ( DOW.N ) or DuPont ( DD.N ) for the 142-year-old German company. Dow's market value is around $38 billion, and DuPont's about $40 billion. Asked about a possible takeover of BASF in September, Hambrecht said he could not see a team elsewhere that could produce better results than the current one. He also said he expected further consolidation in the chemicals industry because the top 10 global companies controlled only about 20 percent of the world market. Saudi Basic Industries Corp. 2010.SE (SABIC), which is worth around $112 billion, is the world's largest chemicals company by market value. BASF shares have risen about 23 percent this year, outshining a 13 percent rise in the pan-European chemicals index .SX4P as investors bet on attractive returns. BASF has sold weak performing assets and trimmed highly cyclical businesses. It spent about 7 billion euros last year to buy U.S. catalyst maker Engelhard, the construction chemicals business of Degussa and U.S. resin maker Johnson Polymer.
