 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Oil prices surged to a fresh six-month high and the U.S. dollar slipped to a five-month low against major currencies on Friday on more evidence from around the world that the economic downturn may be easing. 

 Global stocks rose and some equities markets posted 2009 highs, eroding the safe-haven allure of U.S. dollar-based assets, and sending the euro to a 2009 high against the dollar. U.S. Treasury and euro zone debt prices recovered with the help of mixed economic data and relief over a pause in government bond auctions, allowing the 30-year U.S. long bond to recover more than one full point on the day. Bonds also got a slight safe-haven boost from data showing the U.S. economy contracted at an annual rate of 5.7 percent in the first quarter, a slightly smaller drop than initially estimated but worse than analysts' expectations. U.S. gold futures rose above $980 an ounce to a three-month high as resurgent risk appetite pummeled the dollar. The Reuters-Jefferies CRB index .CRB, a global commodities benchmark, surged to nearly a seven-month high as the prices for oil, copper, and corn rallied on a weaker dollar and news suggesting economic recovery was underway. U.S. light sweet crude oil rose $1.32 to $66.40 a barrel. The U.S. economy contracted slightly less than initially estimated in the first quarter, while corporate profits rebounded, according to a government report that pointed to moderation in the recession. Japanese factory output jumped in April at the fastest rate in more than half a century, and manufacturers forecast further gains despite only tentative signs that global demand is on the rebound from the worst recession in decades. "There's some momentum that could last for another couple of months," said Georgina Taylor, equity strategist at Legal & General Investment Management. "But due to the rally, I think the market has become more sensitive to newsflow. "The story is still the same," she said, "but the movements may be smaller in magnitude. On the whole, data is surprising on the upside." Among other welcome signs German retail sales unexpectedly rose in April, raising hopes that consumer spending could help support Europe's biggest economy after a record slump in gross domestic product in the first quarter, official data showed. And in Britain, house prices rose for the second time in three months in May as the consumer mood steadied and a top retailer enjoyed its best week this year. But U.S. government debt prices rose as other data suggested lingering economic weakness and reminded investors that the road to recovery will be bumpy. Business activity in the U.S. Midwest contracted in May at a more severe rate than expected. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note rose 23/32 in price to yield 3.52 percent. The 2-year U.S. Treasury note was up 1/32 in price to yield 0.93 percent. The benchmark 10-year Bund yield was on track for its biggest monthly rise since December 2001, according to Reuters charts. U.S. stocks traded flat to slightly higher as rising oil prices lifted energy stocks, and European shares closed higher, with oils and miners rising on stronger commodities prices. At 1 p.m., the Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  was up 2.07 points, or 0.02 percent, at 8,405.87. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  was up 1.82 points, or 0.20 percent, at 908.65. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  was down 2.10 points, or 0.12 percent, at 1,749.69. The FTSEurofirst 300  .FTEU3  index of top European shares rose 0.2 percent to 862.17 points, gaining 0.7 percent for the week. In May, the index rose 4.0 percent, a third straight monthly gain and its best winning streak in two years. The U.S. dollar fell against a basket of major currencies, with the Dollar Index .DXY down 1.45 percent at 79.362. Against the yen, the dollar was down 1.53 percent at 95.46. The euro was up 1.44 percent at $1.4137. Japan's Nikkei share average  .N225  rose 0.75 percent to a seven-month high, and the MSCI index of Asia Pacific stocks outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS rose 1.6 percent to its highest since October 3.
