 BANGALORE  (Reuters) - U.S. yellow-pages publisher R.H. Donnelley Corp RHDC.PK filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Thursday after grappling with mounting debt as revenue plummeted due to the onslaught of online search and advertising. 

 The company, which missed a $55 million interest payment Thursday, said the filing was a bid to slash its debt by about $6.4 billion. In a filing with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware, R.H. Donnelley listed total assets of about $11.88 billion and total debts of about $12.37 billion. The company does not plan to seek debtor-in-possession (DIP) financing as it has more than $300 million in cash, and its positive cash flows from operations will be more than sufficient to fund its operations during the restructuring process, it said in a statement. R.H. Donnelley said its total cash interest expense would be slashed by about $500 million annually. The company's unsecured bonds of about $6 billion will be exchanged for 100 percent equity of the restructured company, while existing shareholders will be completely wiped out. R.H. Donnelley currently employs about 3,555 people, according to court documents. The company had said last week that it was seeking support of its bank lenders as part of a potential comprehensive debt restructuring plan. It exercised a 30-day grace period for the payment of interests and then asked creditors for a forbearance until May 28. Competitor Idearc Inc filed for bankruptcy protection in March and had said it agreed with its lenders to reduce its total debt from around $9 billion to $3 billion in secured bank loans. Idearc too said it will not obtain DIP financing during the reorganization, and that it had substantial cash balances and generates positive cash flow. R.H. Donnelley and Idearc Inc IDAR.PK not seeking DIP financing is somewhat of an anomaly in what has so far been a year of record setting DIP deals. In February, a federal bankruptcy judge approved an $8 billion DIP loan for oil and chemical maker Lyondell Chemical Co ACCELC.UL. Companies rely on DIP financing to fund operations, including payroll and paying suppliers, while restructuring under bankruptcy protection. The case is In re: R.H. Donnelley Corp, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, District of Delaware, No 09-11833. (Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman and Gopakumar Warrier)
