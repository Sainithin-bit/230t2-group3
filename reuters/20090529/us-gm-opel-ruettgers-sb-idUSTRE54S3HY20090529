 BERLIN  (Reuters) - The premier of the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia said he expected a result to come out of Friday's meeting in Berlin on the future of the Opel unit of U.S. carmaker General Motors. 

 "I expect to have a result today," Juergen Ruettgers told reporters on going into the meeting. He said he could not confirm whether Canadian car parts group Magna had reached a deal with GM on Opel. (Reporting by  Gernot Heller )
