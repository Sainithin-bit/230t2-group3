 CARLSBAD, California  (Reuters) - A key North American executive has resigned from Yahoo Inc, according to an internal memo on Thursday, becoming the latest senior executive to depart as new management shakes up the Internet giant. 

 Jeff Dossett, who joined Yahoo from Microsoft Corp late last year to lead their North American Audience division, has quit, North American Executive Vice President Hilary Schneider said in a memo obtained by Reuters. It was unclear from the memo why Dossett left. His post will be filled in the interim by two other executives, before a permanent replacement can be found, Schneider said. "I also wanted to take this opportunity to let our colleagues up north know that we are on track with our plans to integrate Yahoo! Canada into the North America region, and I'll provide an update on that front next week," Schneider said in her brief memo. Yahoo's spokeswoman was not immediately available for comment. Chief Executive Carol Bartz -- who arrived in January -- has unveiled a broad reorganization plan to simplify Yahoo's management structure and reshuffle various divisions. In the weeks leading up to that announcement, various executives had left the company, including then-Chief Financial Officer Blake Jorgensen, who has since joined apparel brand Levi Strauss & Co. Dossett's division had been responsible for content at key Yahoo media properties, including Yahoo Sports, Yahoo Finance and Yahoo News. (Reporting by  Alexei Oreskovic ; Editing by  Richard Chang )
