 (Reuters) - Auto parts maker Magna International took pole position in the battle for General Motors' German unit Opel on Friday. 

 Below is a summary of the main factories building Opel cars in Europe. Adam Opel GmbH -- being spun off with Vauxhall Motors of the UK -- is an integral part of the U.S. carmaker's GM Europe subsidiary, which also produce vehicles under the Cadillac, Saab and Chevrolet brands. RUESSELSHEIM, Germany: About 15,600 employees assembled roughly 120,000 vehicles last year at Opel's headquarters. The factory built the Vectra and Signum models as well as the new Insignia. The site also houses a technical center that carries out research and development for the entire GM group. BOCHUM, Germany: A staff of some 5,200 produced close to 200,000 Astra compacts and Astra-based Zafira vans last year in Germany's traditional coal-mining district, which has been grappling with high unemployment for years. Under the original Magna plan, some 2,200 jobs were at risk, according to German politicians. EISENACH, Germany: About 1,800 workers assemble 3-door Corsa subcompacts at the plant, which was inaugurated in 1992 as a hallmark project to revive eastern Germany's decrepit industrial structure. KAISERSLAUTERN, Germany: About 3,500 employees manufacture four-cylinder petrol and diesel engines and components in a plant situated in Rhineland-Palatinate. Fiat CEO Sergio Marchionne had flip-flopped over the issue of its closure. ZARAGOZA, Spain: The factory built 423,000 vehicles last year, consisting of 5-door Corsas, the Meriva minivan based on Corsa architecture, and the Combo delivery van. GLIWICE, Poland: Built about 170,000 vehicles last year, mainly Zafiras as well as Astras, making it a chief rival of Bochum for production volume. ANTWERP, Belgium: Some 133,000 Astras were built in the Flemish plant, often considered to be one of the top candidates for closure. ELLESMERE PORT, Britain: The site assembled over 110,000 Astras in 2008 under the Vauxhall badge, the British version of the Opel brand. LUTON, Britain: Built about 60,000 Vivaro delivery vans last year, a larger sister to the Combo used for commercial purposes. The site is also home to production of some 27,000 Renault Trafic vans, a common use in the industry in order to gain proper scale for the segment of large light commercial vehicles. Like Antwerp, a potential candidate for closure. (Reporting by  Christiaan Hetzner )
