 BERLIN  (Reuters) - The German government will resume its efforts on Friday to find a partner for the Opel unit of General Motors and agree temporary aid for the carmaker after a meeting collapsed with no deal. 

 Here are key questions and answers about the discussions: WHAT HAPPENS ON FRIDAY? Berlin has set a deadline of 8 a.m. EDT for the two potential investors -- Magna and Fiat -- to submit preliminary contracts which have also been agreed with GM and the U.S. Treasury. Berlin has demanded the contracts contain a commitment to the creation of a temporary trustee for Opel and for bridge financing to protect Opel's assets from U.S. creditors if GM files for bankruptcy. The financing, to allow Opel to continue operations until a partner is found, would amount to about 1.5 billion euros. Time is pressing as the German government wants its trustee vehicle to be agreed before GM files for bankruptcy, which is likely to take place in coming days. If there are contracts on the table, negotiations between the German government and officials from GM and the U.S. government will resume at 10 a.m. EDT. Berlin does not know if it will receive one, two or none of these contracts. WHAT IS THE STICKING POINT? The U.S. is opposed to the trustee idea because it fears it would result in a loss of control of the company and of some valuable Opel assets which U.S. creditors might want to claim. In addition, while Germany has set up a consortium of banks to provide 1.5 billion euros ($2.1 billion) in bridge financing, GM Europe shocked participants at a marathon meeting lasting from Wednesday to Thursday by demanding 300 million euros of that immediately to stay operational. Who provides this money and who guarantees it is a key question. WHAT IS THE RISK OF AN OPEL INSOLVENCY? If the U.S. government refuses to agree to the trustee model, the talks could collapse again, resulting in insolvency for Opel. The trustee arrangement can only go ahead if there is an assurance of a long-term partner, so if neither Magna nor Fiat commit to a deal, the risk also increases for Opel. Some members of German Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservative party are pushing her to go down the insolvency route. However, it could cost her party votes in September's election and her Social Democrat coalition partners oppose this path. WHICH BIDDER IS BEST PLACED? There are signs that Magna's offer, backed by Russian bank Sberbank Rossii and carmaker GAZ, is gaining favor. Magna helped its cause by agreeing to fill the 300 million euro GM hole, although a failure to win U.S. guarantees for the funding means it may not happen. A number of German politicians, including an increasing share of conservatives who were previously neutral, say they back Magna. However, Fiat is still in contention. China's Beijing Automotive Industry Corp (BAIC) is not viewed as a serious candidate as it has so far only provided a two-page proposal, but the German government has not officially ruled it out.
