 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Raytheon Co. ( RTN.N ) on Saturday filed a protest with the U.S. government over its award of a U.S. cargo contract to rival contractors, the Wall Street Journal reported in its online edition. 

 A team led by L-3 Communications Holdings Inc. ( LLL.N ) earlier in June won the contract to supply cargo aircraft over the next five years to the U.S. Army and Air Force. The L-3 team includes Boeing Co. ( BA.N ) and Alenia North America, a unit of Italy's Finmeccanica SpA ( SIFI.MI ), as well as Rolls-Royce Plc ( RR.L ) and Honeywell Inc. ( HON.N ). Raytheon officials decided to file a protest after, in the past week, having been briefed on the contest outcome, the Journal reported. "Raytheon filed a bid protest on Friday with the Government Accountability Office regarding the Joint Cargo Aircraft award announced June 13, 2007. We will have no further comment at this time," Raytheon said in a statement obtained by the Journal. A company spokesperson was not immediately available for comment.
