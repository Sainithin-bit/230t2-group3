  NEW YORK (Reuters)- Shares of investment firm State Street 
( STT.N ) fell after investors balked at the $4.5 billion price 
tag it paid for a smaller rival in February, but weakness in 
the shares now gives investors the chance get a piece of the 
firm when it is poised to benefit from expanding global 
securities markets, Barron's reported on Sunday. 

  State Street's shares are trading at 16 times its 2008 
earnings forecast, or significantly below their normal 20 times 
forward estimates, Barron's said.  Richard Bove, an analyst at broker Punk Ziegel, said in the 
article that State Street's acquisition, of Investor Financial 
Services "only enhanced their superb international position."  "The lower multiple certainly creates a buying 
opportunity," added Bove, who has an $85 target on the stock, 
according to Barron's. That is more than 20 percent higher than 
the firm's Friday closing price of $68.32 per share.
