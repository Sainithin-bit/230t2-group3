 LONDON  (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co. ( F.N ) has hired 
accountancy group KPMG to examine the books at its British 
units Jaguar and Land Rover ahead of their expected sale later 
this year, the Sunday Times reported. 

  The newspaper, which not name the source of its 
information, said KPMG had been given a mandate to revamp the 
companies' accounts so that they are in a proper form to be 
examined by would-be buyers.  "KPMG's main task will be giving a clear picture of Jaguar 
and Land Rover's performance as businesses separate from the 
influence of Ford," the paper said, adding that the accounting 
firm is also understood to have been asked to examine the 
companies' pension liabilities.  Officials at Ford and KPMG were not immediately available 
for comment.  Earlier this month, Ford said it was working with financial 
advisers on the best options for Jaguar and Land Rover as it 
continues a strategic review of its global operations.  Sources familiar with the matter have told Reuters that 
Ford had hired investment banks -- including Goldman Sachs 
( GS.N ), HSBC Holdings Plc ( HSBA.L ) and Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ) -- 
to help the automaker explore the sale of the two brands.
