 SEOUL  (Reuters) - Unionized workers at Hyundai Motor Co. ( 005380.KS ), South Korea's top auto maker, have scaled by a plan for work stoppages, a company official said on Sunday. 

 The Korean Metal Workers' Union, which includes the auto industry unions, plan strikes for several days this week as part of protest against a U.S.-South Korea free trade agreement. "The union decided not to stop work from Monday to Wednesday," a Hyundai spokesman said by telephone without elaborations. Hyundai's union was not available for comments. Earlier this month, union members at Hyundai and other auto makers had said they would join their umbrella group's decision to take turns by region in staging two-hour strikes daily from Monday to Wednesday. All members of the metal union group will hold a four-hour strike on Thursday and a six-hour stoppage on Friday. Hyundai's union has not made a decision yet on the work stoppage plan on Thursday and Friday, the Hyundai spokesman said. But many members of Hyundai's union have opposed the plan as the decision was made without a vote. In 2006, Hyundai's union members staged strikes for a total of 33 days as they called for higher wages and better working conditions. Some of the protests were made in opposition to new labor laws and free-trade talks with the United States. Those actions cost Hyundai 115,683 units in lost output, or 1.6 trillion won ($1.72 billion), the company estimated. Last year, South Korean automakers' unionized workers voted to bring their company unions under one industry group to strengthening their bargaining power. Poor labor relations are seen as a major hurdle to Hyundai's target of becoming the world's No.5 automaker by sales volume along with Kia, from the current No.6. In January, Hyundai's unionized workers held a partial strike and refused overtime over a bonus dispute. On Friday, shares in Hyundai closed up 0.81 percent to 74,600 won, outperforming a 1.3 percent fall in the broader market  .KS11 .
