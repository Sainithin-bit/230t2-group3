 ZURICH  (Reuters) - Banks, which have used a glut of cheap 
money to help fuel a boom in real estate and leveraged company 
buyouts, may face a rough ride when lending conditions turn 
sour, the Bank for International Settlements said on Sunday. 

  "Given the key role that a benign credit environment has 
been playing in boosting the performance of the financial 
sector over the past years, a turn in the credit cycle 
represents a significant risk to its outlook," the Basel-based 
BIS said in its annual report.  A combination of low interest rates and unusually 
infrequent rates of default among borrowers in many countries 
have played a big part in boosting profits at financial 
services companies.  The BIS also warned that favorable credit conditions, 
supporting a flood of money into leveraged finance deals, 
structured credit product markets and property, could not last 
forever.  "In many respects these conditions could be characterized 
as exceptional from the perspective of recent business cycle 
experience," it said.  Although corporate defaults are still very low, the ability 
of some companies to carry on servicing very high levels of 
debts could be stretched severely if business conditions take a 
turn for the worse and interest rates rise.  And those banks which have let strict lending rules slip 
may have the most to lose, the BIS said.  "A general question regarding the ability of banks to 
weather potential strains from a turn in the cycle, possibly 
associated with a broader slowdown in economic activity, 
relates to the discipline they have shown in their lending 
standards."
  LBO TARGETS COULD BE AT RISK  Turning to the boom in leveraged financing, the BIS said 
some companies that had been bought in private equity deals 
could find themselves in deep water in a business downturn 
because of the high levels of debt they were carrying.  Under leveraged buyouts (LBOs), a financial sponsor borrows 
money to buy a company and then uses the firm's cash flows to 
pay off the debt, which is often transferred to the target 
company's balance sheet.  "Acquired companies' capital structures are altered through 
so-called "leveraged recapitalizations," which flatter the 
acquirer's income at the expense of the target's equity," it 
said.  This strategy relies heavily on a plentiful flow of cheap 
credit and could be derailed if it started to dry up.  "The financial health of the acquired companies (and 
associated debt) would be the most vulnerable in the event of a 
worsening in the credit or business environment," the BIS said.  The LBO boom may also be putting pressure on companies to 
take on more debt, either as a defense against being taken over 
or as a way of boosting return on equity to match that of 
private equity targets, the report said.  Companies that have been taken private in LBO deals also 
faced reduced disclosure requirements which put their managers 
outside the glare of public scrutiny.  The activities of hedge funds were also hidden from public 
view. "Higher levels of leverage combined with relative 
opaqueness have raised concerns that any problems in the (hedge 
fund) sector could spread widely across the financial system."  Another serious threat to financial stability could also be 
triggered by a slump in real estate markets.  "The boom in the markets for securitized assets related to 
property financing has spread the direct and indirect exposures 
to property risk widely across the financial system," it said.  The ratio of banks' exposure to real estate as a proportion 
of total lending is about two thirds in Spain, slightly less 
than half in Germany, about one quarter in Britain and well 
over 50 percent in the United States and Australia, BIS data 
showed.
