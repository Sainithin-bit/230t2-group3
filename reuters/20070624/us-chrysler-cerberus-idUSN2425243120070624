 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Investment banks helping Cerberus Capital Management LP finance its buyout of Chrysler, the U.S. arm of automaker DaimlerChrysler DCXGn.DE, will launch a road show in the next week to raise funds for the deal, according to a report in the Wall Street Journal, citing a source familiar with the matter. 

 Road show meetings are to take place Tuesday on the West Coast and Friday on the East Coast, according to Standard & Poor's Leveraged Commentary & Data, the Journal reported. J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., Bear Stearns Cos. BSC.N, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. ( GS.N ), Citigroup Inc.
