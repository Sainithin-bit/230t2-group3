 SEOUL  (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs ( GS.N ) is selling its 30.48 percent stake in South Korean cable TV operator C&M, valued at $970 million, the Maeil Business Newspaper said on Monday, citing unnamed investment banking and industry sources. 

 Citigroup ( C.N ), which is handling the deal, closed the auction on Thursday, the newspaper said. The sale may include management rights from the family owners of the country's No. 2 cable TV operator, the daily said. Three investment groups have handed in their bids, including South Korean investment fund MBK Partners, a private equity arm run by Australia's Macquarie Bank MBL.AX and South Korea's Shinhan Financial Group ( 055550.KS ). Goldman bought shares in C&M in 2004 for 140 billion won ($150.9 million), becoming its second-largest shareholder. With the planned stake sale, the U.S. investment bank is likely to earn more than $800 million in capital gains in three years, the report estimated. C&M is the second-largest multi-system cable TV operator in South Korea with 2 million subscribers and the largest in the greater Seoul metropolitan area. Goldman had sought to exit from its investment in C&M via a dual Seoul-London listing that was expected to fetch up to $500 million this year, sources had told Reuters last November. But if the stake sale takes place, the listing plan would be delayed or shelved because of a local securities regulation that stipulates IPO candidates should not change majority shareholders one year before the listing.
