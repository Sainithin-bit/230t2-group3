 PARIS  (Reuters) - Claude Gueant, the chief of staff of 
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, reiterated on Sunday that 
France preferred any bid for domestic bank Societe Generale 
( SOGN.PA ) to be a French one rather than a foreign one. 

  "It would be better if it was French rather than foreign," 
Gueant told the "Grand Rendez-Vous" programme held jointly by 
Europe 1 radio station, TV 5 Monde and Le Parisien newspaper.  Gueant also repeated comments made earlier in an Sunday 
interview with Le Parisien that France preferred any bid for 
SocGen to be a "friendly" bid rather than a hostile one.  He added, however, that France would not have legal means 
to oppose any bid by a foreign bank and that SocGen could 
remain independent.  SocGen has been seen as a bid target since it revealed on 
January 24 4.9 billion euros ($7.28 billion) of losses which it 
has blamed on rogue trades caused by Jerome Kerviel, a 31-year 
old employee of the bank.  Kerviel is under investigation and faces possible charges.  (Reporting by  Sudip Kar-Gupta )
