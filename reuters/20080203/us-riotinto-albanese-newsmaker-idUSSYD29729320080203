 SYDNEY  (Reuters) - With his formal training in geology, Tom Albanese could be excused for believing he'd struck the mother lode after orchestrating a bump-free $38 billion acquisition of Alcan just six months into his new job as chief executive of Rio Tinto, the world's second-largest mining house. 

 That was before bigger rival BHP Billiton said it wanted to buy Rio to assemble a super miner in what could be the second-costliest corporate takeover in history after telephone group Vodafone's purchase of Mannesmann in 2000. Any bragging rights the collegiate-looking American from New Jersey state may have earned from the Alcan deal could be dwarfed this week if, as some think, he succeeds in forcing BHP to offer a lot more to acquire Rio than it wants to. "BHP has been a high," Albanese told reporters in Australia in late January. A $14 billion raid on 12 percent of Rio's stock on Friday by aluminum makers Chinalco of China and Alcoa Inc of the United Sates only fanned speculation that BHP must sweeten the pot or face an uphill fight. "If BHP wants this deal to go through, I think they have to offer some cash," said John Meyer of Fairfax Securities in London after Chinalco and Alcoa confirmed the stock purchases. "Alcan was a very big deal for Albanese, but all that has been lost in the wash because of BHP," said mining analyst James Wilson of DJ Carmichael & Co in Perth, Australia. Albanese was traveling and unavailable for comment, Rio Tinto spokeswoman Amanda Buckely said. In a recent interview with Reuters, Albanese relied on a favorite baseball metaphor in describing BHP's offer of three of its shares for every one Rio share as "two ballparks away" from what he thinks his company is worth. BHP has until February 6 to table a formal offer or refrain from pursuing Rio for at least six month under a "put up or shut up" rule imposed by regulators in Britain at Albanese's request. Rather than take in the afterglow of gazumping Alcoa, which also wanted to buy Canada's Alcan, Albanese, 50, immediately mounted a defense against BHP's unsolicited offer. That proposal was worth $139 billion in November, but only about $126 billion now because of the recent rout of equity markets. "I am as comfortable saying that the three-for-one does not represent value for Rio now as I was back in November," London-based Albanese said in the Reuters interview. Albanese, who loves the outdoors, left home in the eastern U.S. state of New Jersey to study in Alaska. One of his first jobs after college was traipsing across remote Alaska snowfields staking mining claims with his future wife, Mary. He was chief operating officer of another mining company, Nerco, when it was acquired by Rio in 1993. In need of a job, Albanese jumped at the chance to return to his beloved Alaska to pan for gold and silver for Rio, even though he was being paid less money than he was making at Nerco. With a bachelor's degree in mineral economics, and a master's degree in mining engineering from the University of Alaska, Albanese was eventually sent globetrotting for new investments in Russia, Peru and Mongolia before being named chief executive last May when his predecessor retired. At some point Albanese discovered Britain's network of canals, used to shift raw materials and finished goods around the nation during the Industrial Revolution. These days for leisure, rather than camping in Alaska, Albanese tours Britain's inland waterways in his own canal narrow boat -- a precursor to the behemoths that shuttle coal and iron ore across the oceans today.
