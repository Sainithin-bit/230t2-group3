 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Warren Buffett's investment in Swiss 
Reinsurance Co RUKN.VX may turn out to be good for the 
billionaire, but those without such deep pockets may be wary to 
follow, Barron's financial weekly said. 

  After taking a 1.2 billion Swiss-franc write-down related 
to investments in U.S. subprime mortgage, Swiss Re got a shot 
in the arm with Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc's ( BRKa.N ) 
3.03 stake in exchange for roughly $800 million, Barron's said.  Separately, Berkshire entered into a proportional 
reinsurance contract with Swiss Re, the world's largest 
reinsurer by premiums, by taking 20 percent of its property and 
casualty business over the next five years, Barron's said in 
its February 4 edition. In Return, Swiss Re reduces its risk.  Swiss Re's long-term benefit of the Berkshire deal may be 
questionable, Barron's said. For Buffett's help, the Swiss 
reinsurer surrendered a fifth of a business whose operating 
profit grew at a compounded annual average rate of 28 percent 
from 2004 through 2006, the paper said.  Barron's said instead of sharing that revenue with 
Berkshire, one of Swiss Re's prime rivals, the company may have 
done better to sell or close its Credit Solutions unit, part of 
its financial services divisions and the source of its subprime 
losses.  (Editing by Maureen Bavdek)
