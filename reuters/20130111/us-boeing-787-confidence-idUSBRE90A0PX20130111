 (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration wants to maintain public confidence in Boeing Co's new 787 Dreamliner passenger jet after a series of safety incidents prompted a comprehensive review, FAA Administrator Michael Huerta said on Friday. 
 At a press conference in Washington, Huerta's boss, U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood, said he would not hesitate to fly on a 787 himself. (Reporting by  Deborah Charles  in Washington; Writing by  Ben Berkowitz ; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe)
