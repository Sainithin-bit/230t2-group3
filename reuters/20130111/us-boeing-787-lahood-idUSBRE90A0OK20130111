 (Reuters) - U.S. aviation regulators will launch a comprehensive review of the Boeing 787 airplane, with a special focus on its electrical systems, following a series of recent safety incidents, the new head of the Federal Aviation Administration said on Friday. 
 "We believe this is a safe aircraft," Michael Huerta said at a press conference with officials including U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood and Boeing commercial airplanes chief Ray Conner. (Reporting by  Deborah Charles ; in Washington; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe; Writing by  Ben Berkowitz )
