 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - A top White House economic adviser said on Friday that jobs data showed the economy "heading in the right direction." 
 "I think this is a solid report," Council of Economic Advisers Chairman Alan Krueger said on Bloomberg television. "We would certainly like to see unemployment falling faster, but I think one could be confident that the economy has been heading in the right direction. Today's report is further confirmation of that." (Reporting by Timothy Ahmann; Editing by  Chizu Nomiyama )
