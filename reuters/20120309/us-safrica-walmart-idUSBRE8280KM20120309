 CAPE TOWN  (Reuters) - South Africa's government has no immediate plan to contest a court ruling against its appeal of Wal-Mart's ( WMT.N ) $2.4 billion acquisition of local retailer Massmart ( MSMJ.J ), a senior minister said on Friday. 
 Economic Development Minister Ebrahim Patel made the comment at a media briefing. The Competition Appeal Court earlier on Friday shot down the government's request to have the deal re-examined, although it did rule that about 500 previously fired workers should be reinstated.
