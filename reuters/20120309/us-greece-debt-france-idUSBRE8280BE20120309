 PARIS  (Reuters) - French Finance Minister Francois Baroin said on Friday that Greece's negotiated debt-swap deal was good news and avoided a default for the debt-laden country. 
 "It's good news, it's a good success," Baroin told RTL radio. "It's something that allows us to stay on a voluntary basis that avoids the risk of default." He said he also had confidence in the Spanish government's ability to resolve its large deficit pile. (Reporting by  John Irish ; Editing by  James Regan )
