 Greece hails "extremely" successful debt swap deal 
 ATHENS  (Reuters) - A bond swap offer to ease the country's debt burden has been very successful, Greece's finance minister said on Friday after the exchange won strong acceptance from creditors and averted the immediate risk of a default by Athens. "The debt swap had an extremely high degree of success," Evangelos Venizelos told parliament in his first public comments since the official release of results from the offer.
