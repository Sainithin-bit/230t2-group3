 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Profit at General Electric Co fell 42 percent, as a global economic slump hammered its hefty finance arm and eroded demand for the heavy equipment it manufactures. 

 GE said third-quarter profit fell to $2.49 billion, or 23 cents per share, from $4.31 billion, or 43 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding restructuring and other charges, the company earned 22 cents per share, two cents more than analysts were expecting, but revenue fell 20 percent to $37.8 billion, missing analysts forecasts for $39.5 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Chief Executive Jeff Immelt said the economy "is beginning to slowly recover." COMMENTS: ARTHUR HOGAN, CHIEF MARKET ANALYST AT JEFFERIES & CO IN BOSTON "We know GE will improve with the improving economy, because they are really a microcosm of the S&P 500. But the biggest piece of the GE story that we've been concerned about has been GE Capital. And one of the first comments in the release is that GE Capital is stabilizing. I think that's good news. That will be applauded today. "The stabilization in that segment of their business is going to be very closely watched and I think that is what investors will react to today." CHRISTIAN BLAABJERG, CHIEF EQUITY STRATEGIST AT SAXO BANK, COPENHAGEN "GE posts better than expected earnings only due to cost cutting and controlling, but it is still suffering from the slowdown in the economy and is likely to remain in that state for a while." ANGUS CAMPBELL, HEAD OF SALES AT CAPITAL SPREADS, LONDON "It is almost like the market has got ahead of itself and the expectations built in were so high that even if they beat the forecasts on Wall Street then we were going to see profit taking "People were really expecting much better numbers, so they were rushing to upgrade estimates and all of sudden they're good numbers but maybe just not as good as expected."
