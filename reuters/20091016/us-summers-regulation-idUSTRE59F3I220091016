 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - All financial firms have benefited from U.S. taxpayer support and must yield to efforts to tighten regulation to prevent a future crisis, U.S. President Barack Obama's top economic adviser said on Friday. 

 Speaking at a financial markets conference in New York, Larry Summers said tighter regulations wouldn't mean financial firms will never go bust again, but better rules might keep them from threatening to bring down the rest of the financial system. After two years of economic crisis and government rescue efforts, Summers told an audience of financial market participants that the banks at the center of the credit debacle had a moral imperative to be part of the solution. "Financial institutions that have benefited from government support can, should, and must use this moment to think about what they can do for their country -- by accepting the necessary regulation to protect the American people," Summers said. "Wall Street was no small part of the cause of the crisis and Wall Street needs to be part of the solution." The Obama administration has been pressing for wide-ranging reforms in U.S. financial regulations. It scored a victory on Thursday when a House of Representatives' panel passed a bill to tighten regulation of financial derivatives. That legislation, however, took a step back from an administration proposal by exempting standardized over-the-counter derivatives from having to go through a central clearinghouse when corporations are using them to hedge operational risks. It also exempted some standardized swaps from mandatory exchange trading. The action followed months of drift and closed-door talks with bankers and Republicans who are fighting to protect profit margins from the Democrats' drive for tougher rules. "The time has come for fundamental change in the financial sector of our economy -- both in how financial institutions conduct their business and how they are regulated," Summers said. He added that government measures to stem the credit crisis had helped all financial firms, and they should therefore do their part to fix the system. "There is no financial institution that exists today that is not the direct or indirect beneficiary of trillions of dollars of taxpayer support for the financial system. This has direct relevance on the changing nature of the social compact between the financial sector and the broader economy," he said. New, tighter regulation doesn't mean, however, that financial firms will never go bust again. In fact, Summers said that such firms must be able to fail for market discipline to work. In addition to that, though, profitability and prudence should be reconciled under any framework of financial regulation. "The financial system has to be safe for failure," said Summers. Summers also said that officials need to avoid prematurely withdrawing measures meant to stimulate the economy after the worst recession in decades, noting that discussions of any "exit strategy" would be different on Main Street than they would on Wall Street.
