 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Lazard Ltd's board of directors will meet in two weeks to begin a search for Chief Executive Bruce Wasserstein's successor, Bloomberg reported on Friday, citing two people familiar with the matter. 

 Wasserstein, who died this week at 61, has been replaced on an interim basis by Steven Golub, 63, and vice chairman of the firm. The board will consider whether to keep Golub in the job or to name someone else to the role, the people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg. Monica Orbe, a spokeswoman for Lazard, declined to comment. (Reporting by  Elinor Comlay ; Editing Bernard Orr)
