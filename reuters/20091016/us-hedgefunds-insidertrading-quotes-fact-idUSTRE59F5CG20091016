 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Galleon Group founder Raj Rajaratnam and five others were charged with engaging in the largest ever hedge fund insider-trading scheme, generating profits of more than $20 million over several years, U.S. prosecutors, the FBI and the SEC said Friday. 

 The following lists some of the colorful quotes found on wire taps by U.S. prosecutors and described in the criminal complaints: Galleon founder Raj Rajaratnam asked about showing a pattern of trading: "I think you should buy and sell, and buy and sell." Akamai executive: "Danielle, I have a major present for you." Danielle Chiesi, a portfolio manager at hedge fund New Castle, asks what he is talking about. Akamai executive: "Information". Chiesi: "Well that, that is a great present." Chiesi: "Akamai.... I'm trading it tomorrow.. They're gonna guide down. I just got a call from my guy ... I was talking about the family and everything, and then he said people think it's gonna go to 25 (dollars per share). They print on Wednesday." Rajaratnam: "You got a few more days, Friday, Monday ..." Chiesi: "Just keep shorting every day. We got a lot of days." Chiesi to Mark Kurland, senior director at New Castle: "Do you want me to call (the Akamai Executive) up? It's a pretty (expletive) scary thing to do." Chiesi on the AMD trades: "I don't want anybody else to make money on this but us, 'cuz I don't want to get in trouble for a lot of reasons." Chiesi to a co-conspirator: "I swear to you in front of God ... You put me in jail if you talk." Chiesi (later): "I'm dead if this leaks. I really am ... and my career is over. I'll be like Martha (expletive) Stewart." Source: Court Documents (Reporting by  Emily Chasan ; Editing Bernard Orr)
