 BERLIN  (Reuters) - European finance ministers meeting in Berlin on Sunday agreed on the direct regulation of hedge funds, a German government source said. 

 The source said "the call for direct regulation of hedge funds was no longer questioned by any participant." The ministers were meeting to prepare a common stance on overhauling global financial rules ahead of a broader summit of G20 nations in London on April 2. (Writing by  Paul Carrel )
