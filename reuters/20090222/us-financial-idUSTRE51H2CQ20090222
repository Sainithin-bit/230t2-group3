 BERLIN  (Reuters) - European leaders sought on Sunday to overhaul global financial rules and hammer out a common approach to the economic downturn at a meeting in Berlin. 

 They are under pressure to deliver on pledges made at the November G20 summit in Washington, where they unveiled plans to guard against further economic meltdowns. The G20 group of leading developed and developing nations meets again in London on April 2. Since the last G20, recessions in Europe and the United States have deepened, forcing governments to push through huge stimulus packages that have rekindled fears of protectionism. After near daily announcements of cash injections to prop up banks, tide over the auto sector and prevent more Americans losing their homes, U.S. President Barack Obama is already looking at where the U.S. economy will be after any recovery. He is expected to unveil a plan to cut the ballooning deficit in half by 2013 with a mix of tax increases on wealthier Americans and spending cuts. Private economists project the deficit will rise to $1.5 trillion this year. "We can't generate sustained growth without getting our deficits under control," Obama, due to host a summit on Monday on fiscal responsibility, said in his weekly radio address. "On Thursday I'll release a budget that's sober in its assessments, honest in its accounting, and lays out in detail my strategy for investing in what we need, cutting what we don't and restoring fiscal discipline," he said. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, hosting the leaders of Europe's big economies, is also keen to focus on long-term reforms and not see Sunday's meeting hijacked by new problems, notably worries about the fragility of some euro zone nations. Among the ideas up for discussion in Berlin are how to ensure transparency and accountability, enhancing regulation, boosting international cooperation to supervise cross-border institutions as well as increasing IMF resources. But ahead of the gathering, the International Monetary Fund threw its weight behind the idea of a common European bond to alleviate pressure on euro states such as Ireland and Greece that are being forced to pay hefty premiums over stronger bloc members to finance their debt. Germany, Europe's benchmark issuer of debt, has rejected the idea. CURRENCY SWAPS Up to 100,000 people marched through Dublin on Saturday to protest at government cutbacks, including a pension levy on public sector workers and freeze their pay, brought in to try to stem a ballooning budget deficit. Greece is not ruling out tax measures to achieve its fiscal targets, its finance minister said, after the EU started disciplinary action over the budget shortfall exceeding the EU ceiling of 3 percent of gross domestic product. In eastern Europe, the currencies of countries such as Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary have come under severe pressure, hitting millions across the region who have borrowed in foreign currencies such as the euro. Currency concerns were at the heart of a meeting of finance officials from Asian countries, heavily dependent on exports, on the Thai island of Phuket on Sunday. They agreed to expand a currency swap agreement to $120 billion to help bolster currencies that have been battered during the downturn. The 10 members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) plus Japan, China and South Korea pledged last year to pool bilateral currency swap arrangements under the so-called Chiang Mai Initiative in an $80 billion multilateral fund that could be tapped in emergencies. The idea is to allow countries hit by short-term liquidity shortages to borrow foreign reserves from other countries to absorb selling pressure on their currencies. Stock markets plunged worldwide last week and investors were looking for safety in U.S. government debt and gold, driving up the price to more than $1,000 an ounce. Financial markets remained concerned that the slump, triggered in mid-2007 by the falling U.S. housing market, is continuing to take its toll on banks, despite efforts by many governments to shore up the financial systems. Kuwait's main shares index ended lower on Sunday due to uncertainty over the government's rescue package, due to be debated by parliament next month. The Doha benchmark also fell.
