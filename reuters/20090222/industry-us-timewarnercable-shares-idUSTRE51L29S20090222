 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Investors should be cautious about buying Time Warner Cable shares in the near term after parent Time Warner Inc announced plans to spin off its cable television unit, according to Barron's. 

 The parent company said last week it will distribute all the Time Warner Cable stock it owns to Time Warner Inc shareholders, as part of a plan to split the U.S. company's media content and distribution businesses. The weekly business newspaper said it is likely that enough of that stock will be sold quickly, putting pressure on Time Warner Cable shares -- which have fallen about 18 percent so far this year as of its close at $17.62 on Friday. Time Warner Cable's stock is "rather generously valued" compared to rival Comcast, despite other fundamental concerns with the company, Barron's said. "(I)nvestors might want to lighten up on TWC, wait to buy, or bid well below recent prices to ease in until the noise abates," it said.
