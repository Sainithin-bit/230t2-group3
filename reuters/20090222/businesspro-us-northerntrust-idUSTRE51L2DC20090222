 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Asset administrator Northern Trust Corp ( NTRS.O ) has good growth prospects and a better outlook than many in the hobbled U.S. financial sector, according to Barron's. 

 The custody bank and asset manager has a more attractive balance sheet than most financial institutions, its customer ranks are expanding, and it has managed to attract clients overseas, the newspaper said in promoting Northern Trust's stock over the long term. Barron's February 23 edition noted the Chicago-based firm has "largely steered clear of housing finance," suggesting its shares will rise over the next 12 months. The shares are down about 22 percent in the last 12 months. "If the financial markets continue to deteriorate, Northern Trust won't be unscathed," it said. "But the nature of its business offers a margin of safety, while its track record, and other banks' troubles, could lead to substantial growth."
