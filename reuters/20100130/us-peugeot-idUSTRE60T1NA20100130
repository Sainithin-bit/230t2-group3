 PARIS  (Reuters) - French carmaker PSA Peugeot Citroen ( PEUP.PA ) said on Saturday it would recall nearly 100,000 cars because they have the same accelerator-related problems currently afflicting Japan's Toyota ( 7203.T ). 

 "We are going to do the same thing as Toyota. We are going to do a recall," said a PSA Peugeot Citroen spokesman. The spokesman declined to give a precise figure for the amount of vehicles to be recalled but said it would be "under 100,000." He said the recall would affect the Peugeot 107 and Citroen C1 models made at a factory in the Czech Republic where the French group and Toyota jointly produce cars. Toyota President Akio Toyoda apologized for the recall of millions of vehicles around the world, Japanese broadcaster NHK reported on Saturday, as the deepening crisis threatened to further damage its sales and delay an earnings recovery.
