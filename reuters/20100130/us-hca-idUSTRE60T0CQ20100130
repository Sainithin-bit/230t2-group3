 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - HCA Inc said on Friday it will pay its private equity owners a $1.75 billion dividend as the hospital operator reported preliminary fourth-quarter results showing net income fell nearly 22 percent and revenue rose 4.7 percent. 

 The privately owned company said the dividend will be paid on February 5 to stockholders and vested option holders as of February 1. It will be funded through funds available under its existing asset-based and general revolving credit facilities and cash on hand. The hospital operator has been considered for an initial public offering, a source familiar with situation told Reuters last year. (Reporting by  Martinne Geller ; Editing by  Sanjeev Miglani )
