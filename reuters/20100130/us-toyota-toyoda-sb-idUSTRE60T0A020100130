 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp's president, Akio Toyoda, has apologized for a recall of millions of the top automaker's vehicles around the world, Japanese broadcaster NHK said on Saturday. 

 "We're extremely sorry to have made customers uneasy," Toyoda was quoted as telling NHK in an interview in Davos, Switzerland, on Friday. "We plan to establish the facts and give an explanation that will take away customers' concerns as soon as possible." Toyota has said it will extend its safety recall of its most popular cars to Europe and China. The scale of the recall to fix faulty accelerator pedals has emboldened rivals and could land the Japanese carmaker with hundreds of millions of dollars in extra costs per month.
