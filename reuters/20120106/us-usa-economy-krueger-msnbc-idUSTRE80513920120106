 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - President Barack Obama's chief economist on Friday said that recent signs of job growth point to an improving economy, following a report that showed much stronger-than-expected job creation during December. 
 "It all suggests that the economy has been moving in the right direction," Alan Krueger, the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, told network MSNBC. (Reporting by  Jason Lange ; Editing by Theodore d'Afflisio)
