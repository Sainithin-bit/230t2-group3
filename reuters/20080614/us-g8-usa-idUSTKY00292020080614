 OSAKA, Japan  (Reuters) - U.S. economic growth should gain speed by the year-end but is at heightened risk of a prolonged downturn because of soaring oil prices, Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson warned on Saturday. 

 Speaking after a meeting of Group of Eight finance ministers, Paulson said falling home prices, financial market turmoil and lofty energy costs all weighed on growth. "While we are still working through housing and capital markets issues, and expect to be doing so for some time, we also expect to see a faster pace of U.S. economic growth before the end of the year, while recognizing that the recent increase in oil prices risks prolonging the U.S. economic downturn," Paulson said.
