 HELSINKI  (Reuters) - The European Union's top economic official said Greece was "practically certain" to get a new tranche of bailout loans, public broadcaster YLE reported on Friday. 

 Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn was also quoted as saying the issue will be decided on Saturday. European finance ministers are due to hold a teleconference on Saturday, instead of a meeting originally scheduled for Sunday. (Reporting by Helsinki Newsroom; Editing by Susan Fenton)
