 (Reuters) - New York state Attorney General Eric Schneiderman has issued subpoenas seeking new depositions from Bank of America's ( BAC.N ) chief executive and other current and former executives, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the situation. 

 The subpoenas relate to a civil-fraud investigation brought against the bank and its executives by the state's former attorney general Andrew Cuomo, the paper said. Cuomo, now the governor of New York, accused the bank, its former CEO Kenneth Lewis and other executives of intentionally failing to disclose massive losses at Merrill ahead of a December 5, 2008, shareholder vote on the merger. Cuomo also alleged that the defendants later misled the federal government in arguing that a "surprise" increase in Merrill's losses allowed the bank to back out of the merger unless it received massive taxpayer help. It was not clear what Schneiderman wants to know from current CEO Brian Moynihan, who took over when Lewis retired at the end of 2009, the business daily reported. The New York state attorney general's office declined to comment. Bank of America could not immediately be reached for comment. (Reporting by Jochelle Mendonca in Bangalore; Editing by  Gary Hill )
