 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Investors massively returned to emerging market equity funds in the week ended June 29 as hopes that Greece would avoid imminent bankruptcy encouraged risk taking, fund tracker EFPR Global said on Friday. 

 Inflows into global emerging markets funds hit a 12-week high during the week, after three consecutive weeks of outflows, according to EPFR, which tracks funds with $14 trillion in total assets. "Progress on Greece's immediate debt problems reduced the pressure on riskier asset classes," EFPR said in a statement. Greece on Thursday approved the final austerity measures asked for by the European Union and the International Monetary Fund in exchange for the funding it needs to avoid an imminent debt default. Hopes that Athens would pass its austerity package triggered a rally in stocks and the euro this week. Global equity funds continued to suffer redemptions, however. They collectively lost $4.4 billion during the week, after outflows of $3.32 billion in the previous period. Global-tracked bond funds took in a net $241 million, while redemptions from money market funds totaled $29.9 billion, EPFR said. (Reporting by  Walter Brandimarte ; Editing by Leslie Adler)
