 DETROIT  (Reuters) - General Motors Co announced two separate recalls on Friday affecting a little more than 10,000 pickup trucks, predominantly in North America. 

 GM recalled more than 9,000 Chevrolet Colorado and GM Canyon trucks for the model year 2011 because these vehicles may have been built with an automotive transmission clip that could slip and inaccurately show the position of the transmission gear. A driver could move the shifter to "park," but the transmission gear might not be in "park" and the vehicle could roll away and cause a crash, according to a notice posted on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) website. GM also is recalling some other pickup trucks for the model year 2011 because the bolts on the intermediate steering shaft may not have been tightened to the proper specification. A total of 891 trucks are affected in the United States, Canada and Mexico. The affected models include the 2011 Cadillac Escalade, Chevrolet Silverado and GM Sierra trucks.
