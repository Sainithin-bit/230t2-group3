 (Reuters) - Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner is considering leaving the administration after a deal to raise the debt limit is reached, people familiar with his thinking said on Thursday. Below are some candidates that analysts view as potential replacements. 

 MIKE BLOOMBERG Rumors swirled that Bloomberg would replace Geithner when the New York mayor played a round of golf with President Barack Obama in August 2010. At the time, Bloomberg and the White House squashed the rumor. But Bloomberg, the billionaire founder of the eponymous financial information company, could help repair relations between the Obama administration and the business community. Like Geithner, Bloomberg was formerly a Republican and changed his affiliation to independent. JAMIE DIMON The outspoken chief executive of JPMorgan Chase was hailed as a banking hero when he agreed to throw the now defunct Bear Stearns a lifeline during the 2007-09 financial crisis. Since then, Dimon has sparred publicly and behind the scenes with the Obama administration on new rules required by the Dodd-Frank regulation bill. Nevertheless, Obama has praised Dimon's company as being well-managed. GARY GENSLER Even though the chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission used to work at Goldman Sachs, Gensler has managed to persuade the masses he is no friend of Wall Street by taking a tough stance on rules for the over-the-counter derivatives market. Gensler became a partner at Goldman Sachs at the age of 30 before becoming a top official at the Treasury Department from 1997 to 2001, serving alongside Geithner. ERSKINE BOWLES Obama plucked Bowles, who had served as chief of staff to former President Bill Clinton, to help lead a bipartisan effort to tackle the country's burgeoning budget deficit. Bowles, a former president of the University of North Carolina, started his business career at Morgan Stanley in New York and later founded an investment banking firm. Clinton named Bowles to lead the Small Business Administration in 1993. Bowles became White House chief of staff in 1996. In that position, he helped negotiate the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 with Republican congressional leaders, producing the first balanced U.S. budget in nearly 30 years. ROGER ALTMAN The Obama administration eyed the investment banker to replace Larry Summers as head of the National Economic Council. But ultimately it chose one of Geithner's counselors, Gene Sperling, to help coordinate economic policy across the administration. Altman served two stints at the Treasury Department, first in 1977-81 as assistant secretary in the administration of President Jimmy Carter, and second in 1993-94 as deputy secretary under President Bill Clinton. Altman is the founder and chairman of Evercore Partners Inc, a New York-based boutique investment bank. JEFFREY IMMELT Obama picked the CEO of General Electric to help advise the administration on ways to create jobs. Immelt, a lifelong Republican, was viewed as a way for the White House to mend relations with the business community. The jobs panel earlier this month came up with a modest set of recommendations, including measures to cut red tape for businesses, provide more loans, invest in energy efficiency and attract more foreign tourists. GE's lending unit, GE Capital, sought a government guarantee for $139 billion in debt during the financial crisis. (Reporting by  Rachelle Younglai ; Editing by  Gary Hill )
