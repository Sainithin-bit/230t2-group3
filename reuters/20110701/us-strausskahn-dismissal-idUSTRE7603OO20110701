 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A lawyer for accused former IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn said on Friday said he would pursue a dismissal of all charges against his client. 

 The lawyer said Strauss-Kahn is innocent and his story has never changed. The former IMF chief faces charges including attempted rape, sexual assault and sexual abuse. He was released without bail on Friday after a dramatic court hearing where the sexual assault case against him appeared to shift in his favor. (Reporting by Basil Katz, editing by Christine Kearney)
