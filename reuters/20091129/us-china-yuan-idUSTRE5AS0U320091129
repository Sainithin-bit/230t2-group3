 BEIJING  (Reuters) - Premier Wen Jiabao on Sunday restated China's long-standing position that the yuan's exchange rate should be kept at a reasonable, balanced level. 

 State television showed Wen meeting a trio of top economic officials from the euro zone, who were making the case for a strengthening of the Chinese currency. Wen also said China wanted to see stability in the world's major reserve currencies -- a thinly veiled way of saying China is unhappy with the weakening trend of the dollar.
