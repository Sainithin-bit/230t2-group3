 BEIJING  (Reuters) - China's Ministry of Commerce has begun a year-long anti-dumping investigation into chloroform from the United States, Europe and South Korea, it said this weekend. 

 China often conducts anti-dumping investigations into chemical products, particularly from South Korea. Its recent investigations over chicken parts and automobiles imported from the United States have been given more attention as they were undertaken in retaliation for U.S. safeguard duties against Chinese-made tires. The ministry decided not to pursue an investigation into chloroform from India, it said on its website, www.mofcom.gov.cn. (Reporting by  Lucy Hornby ; Editing by  Ron Popeski )
