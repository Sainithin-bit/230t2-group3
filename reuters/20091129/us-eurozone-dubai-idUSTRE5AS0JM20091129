 NANJING, China  (Reuters) - The euro zone does not risk the sort of debt problems plaguing Dubai, senior European Union officials said on Sunday. 

 Dubai was forced to seek a debt standstill last week, rocking global markets and reviving concerns about the fiscal health of some euro zone members, notably Greece. Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker, who chairs the Eurogroup of euro zone finance ministers, said he saw no risk of such a default in the euro area. European Central Bank Governor Jean-Claude Trichet "entirely" confirmed what Juncker said. The two were speaking at a news conference after a day of talks with Premier Wen Jiabao and other senior Chinese officials.
