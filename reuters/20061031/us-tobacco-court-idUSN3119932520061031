 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - A Philip Morris attorney on Tuesday challenged a $79.5 million punitive damages award to a former smoker's widow, arguing before the U.S. Supreme Court the tobacco giant could not be punished for harm to other smokers. 

 But a lawyer for Mayola Williams, whose husband died of lung cancer in 1997 after smoking for more than 40 years, defended the large award won by his client. "This jury did a very good job," he said in urging that the award be upheld. The case has been closely watched by business groups who want the nation's high court to impose new constitutional limits on punitive damages designed to punish and deter misconduct. Businesses have long complained that punitive damages are skyrocketing out of control, can be arbitrary and encourage frivolous lawsuits. Lawyers for those who have been injured defend big awards as a way to get companies to fix harmful product defects. The justices during the hour-long arguments showed little interest in tightening the constitutional limits on punitive damages. They instead focused mostly on a procedural questions and the instructions given to the jury. They repeatedly asked whether the jury had been properly told and understood the distinction that it could consider the harm to other smokers in assessing the misconduct by the Altria Group Inc. ( MO.N ) unit, but could not punish the company for the harm to others who were not parties in the lawsuit. The justices also questioned whether the jury instructions proposed by Philip Morris were an improvement over the actual instructions. And they said they did not understand the basis for the Oregon Supreme Court ruling upholding the award. "Isn't perhaps the better course to send this back to them (the Oregon Supreme Court) and say, 'We don't know what you mean,'" Justice David Souter said. At least two other justices suggested such a resolution of the case. Andrew Frey, the attorney for Philip Morris, challenged the award as excessive and unfair punishment. "The problem we were worried about was that the jury would think of itself as the punishment agency to impose statewide punishment for the harms to all Oregon smokers who were deceived by Philip Morris," he said. But Robert Peck, representing the smoker's wife, defended the award she won in her lawsuit for fraud and negligence. "This was a massive, market-directed fraud driven by their rational and deliberate decisions at the highest levels of the company to deceive customers and knowingly endanger their health," he said. "They knew that this would have a special impact on those who are highly addicted, as Jesse Williams was. And so this is the misconduct that Oregon is seeking to deter," Peck said. In response to a question from Chief Justice John Roberts, Peck said he is not asking the court to overturn any of its past precedents on punitive damages. The court last ruled on the issue in 2003. The court is expected to rule in the case before the middle of next year.
