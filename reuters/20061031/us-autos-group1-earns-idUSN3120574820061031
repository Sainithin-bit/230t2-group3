 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Car dealership chain Group 1 Automotive Inc. ( GPI.N ) will need to cut orders of 2007-model year vehicles from Detroit's Big Three automakers to reduce inventories of unsold vehicles, its chief executive said on Tuesday. 

 "We have probably at least 30 percent too much inventory, maybe 40 percent for our current level of sales," CEO Earl Hesterberg told Reuters in an interview. "So in future months we have to be ordering 30 or 40 percent less vehicles than what we are actually retailing." Hesterberg said the inventory situation at Group 1 is "very poor to the degree that to us it is unacceptable." Group 1 has more than 100 days supply of vehicles from General Motors Corp. ( GM.N ), Ford Motor Co.( F.N ) and DaimlerChrysler AG's Chrysler Group DCXGn.DE. The CEO said the company aims to reduce the inventory levels of the Big Three brands to a 75 days supply, but production cuts from the automakers are needed to bring inventories in line. The chain on Tuesday posted a 22 percent increase in third-quarter earnings on improved margins and raised its full-year outlook, sending its shares up nearly 10 percent.
