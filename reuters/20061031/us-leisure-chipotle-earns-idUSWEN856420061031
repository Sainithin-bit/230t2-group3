 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. ( CMG.N ) on Tuesday reported higher quarterly net income due to strong sales, higher menu prices, and lower commodity costs. 

 Third-quarter net income was $11.8 million, or 36 cents, per share, compared with $5.1 million, or 19 cents per share, a year ago. Earlier this month, McDonald's Corp. ( MCD.N ) completed its spin-off of Chipotle. The fast-food company first invested in Chipotle in 1998 but divested it as part of a broader strategy to focus on its main hamburger business.
