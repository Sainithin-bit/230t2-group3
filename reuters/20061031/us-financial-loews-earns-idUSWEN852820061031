 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Loews Corp. LTR.N, the conglomerate run by the Tisch family, on Tuesday said third- quarter profit doubled, helped by fewer hurricane-related insurance payouts and higher tobacco and oil-drilling gains. 

 Net income at New York-based Loews, whose businesses include financial, tobacco, energy, hotel and watch-making companies, rose to $635.1 million from a restated $302.2 million a year earlier. Revenue rose 9 percent to $4.51 billion. Profit attributable to Loews shareholders rose to $517.2 million, or 94 cents per share, from $234.7 million, or 42 cents. Analysts polled by Reuters Estimates on average forecast profit of 85 cents per share. "Mother Nature left us basically unscathed," Loews Chief Executive James Tisch said on a conference call. Chicago-based CNA Financial Corp. ( CNA.N ), the No. 7 U.S. commercial insurer and Loews' largest unit, said profit rose to $311 million, or $1.15 per share, from a restated $6 million, when Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and other storms hurt results. Earnings from continuing operations at CNA totaled $1.13 per share, topping forecasts for 97 cents. The insurer used 94.5 percent of property and casualty premium income for claims and expenses, down from 119.9 percent. "CNA's net investment income is strong," Tisch said. "It continues to emphasize underwriting discipline and expenses are being aggressively managed." Loews owns 89 percent of CNA. CAROLINA, DIAMOND Net income at Carolina Group CG.N, a tracking stock for the Lorillard Inc. tobacco unit, rose 18 percent to $202.9 million. Profit attributable to Carolina shareholders was $1.17 per share, up from 99 cents. Analysts expected $1.08. Carolina net sales rose 6 percent to $986 million, as market share increased and marketing expenses declined. Lorillard brands include Newport, Kent and True. Last week, Lorillard said it will develop and sell smokeless tobacco products in the United States with Swedish Match ( SWMA.ST ). It joined Reynolds American Inc. ( RAI.N ) in making a major push into that category amid consumer concerns about the health risks of smoking. Also last week, Houston-based Diamond Offshore Drilling Inc. ( DO.N ), in which Loews has a 54 percent stake, said quarterly profit doubled to $164.5 million, or $1.19 per share, helped by increased day rates for rigs. Profit also rose at Boardwalk Pipeline Partners LP ( BWP.N ), in which Loews owns an 85 percent stake, and at Loews Hotels. Loews also owns watchmaker Bulova Corp. Loews is run by James Tisch and Co-Chairmen Andrew Tisch and Jonathan Tisch. Andrew and James Tisch's late father, Laurence Tisch, and Jonathan Tisch's late father, Preston Robert Tisch, were also Loews chairmen. In Tuesday afternoon trading, Loews shares were down 43 cents at $38.65, CNA was up 19 cents at $37.75 and Carolina rose 60 cents to $57.71.
