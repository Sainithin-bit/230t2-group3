 WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. employment costs rose a bigger-than-expected 1.0 percent in the third quarter, the largest increase in more than two years, as wages, salaries and benefits advanced during the quarter, a government report showed on Tuesday. 

 The increase in the Employment Cost Index, a broad gauge of what employers pay in wages and benefits, edged up from the second quarter's 0.9 percent gain and was larger than the 0.9 percent rise economists in a Reuters poll had forecast, Labor Department data showed. It was the biggest increase since a 1.1 percent rise in the first quarter of 2004 and matched a 1.0 percent gain during the second quarter of that year. The larger-than-expected increase in costs likely adds some worry to Federal Reserve policy-makers as they weigh whether they are done raising interest rates to curb inflation even as the economy cools. Wages and salaries advanced 0.9 percent during the third quarter after logging a 0.9 percent gain the prior quarter. Benefit costs advanced 1.1 percent after a 0.8 percent rise, the biggest quarterly gain in a year. In the 12 months ended in September, employment costs were up 3.3 percent, with wages and salaries up 3.2 percent and benefit costs up 3.3 percent as well.
