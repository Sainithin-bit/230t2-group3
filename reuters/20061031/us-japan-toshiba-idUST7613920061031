 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Private equity firms Carlyle Group and Unison Capital led a $774 million management buyout of chip wafer maker Toshiba Ceramics Co., making it Japan's second largest buyout this year. 

 Parent Toshiba Corp., Japan's No. 2 electronics conglomerate after Hitachi Ltd., plans to sell its 40.4 percent stake in the wafer maker to focus its resources on flash memory chips used in mobile phones and music players and its nuclear power business. Carlyle and Unison will jointly set up a special-purpose vehicle to buy all Toshiba Ceramics shares at 600 yen each through a tender offer from November 1 to December 4, an 8.5 percent premium to the last closing price and valuing the deal at about 91 billion yen ($774 million). Investment bank Nomura will act as the agent for the tender offer while UBS advised Toshiba Ceramics. Shares of Toshiba Ceramics closed 7.8 percent higher at 596 yen. The tender offer price values Toshiba Ceramics at 24 times its earnings forecast for this business year. That compares with 22 times at rival Shin-Etsu Chemical Co and 15 times at SUMCO Corp. Management buyouts have been relatively rare in Japan, where rigid shareholding structures have discouraged them, although a growing number of the country's sprawling conglomerates are choosing to dispose of non-core units this way in an effort to streamline their businesses. The deal is the second-biggest MBO this year, behind the $3.2 billion buyout of restaurant operator Skylark Co., and is the fourth biggest on record in Japan, according to financial data providers Dealogic. More companies find leaving mammoth organisational structures speeds up decision-making, said Carlyle Group Managing Director Tamotsu Adachi. "By leaving these big organisations, businesses are freed to seek new clients among the parent firm's rivals, find new sources of funding and grow," he told reporters after a news conference. After the buyout, Toshiba Ceramics would have access to credit lines of 140 billion yen, including those from the funds and banks, up 83 percent from capital raised this year, Toshiba Ceramics President Susumu Kohyama said. A WIN-WIN DEAL? During the first half of 2006, the value of MBOs in Japan hit a record $3.1 billion, according to data provider Thomson Financial. In an MBO, management acquire a controlling stake in the company, often in partnership with a private equity house which can provide capital and financial expertise. Three senior managers at Toshiba Ceramics each have only a 0.01 percent equity shareholding in the company, but they may raise this if the tender offer is successful. Toshiba Ceramics, which had group sales of about 85 billion yen in the business year ended in March and is dwarfed in the silicon wafer market by larger rivals Shin-Etsu and SUMCO, plans to spend roughly 30 billion yen to boost production capacity of cost-efficient 300 millimeter silicon wafers to 150,000 wafers per month by 2009. Toshiba may regret letting Toshiba Ceramics go at a time when strong chip demand is boosting sales of wafers, said Mitsushige Akino, chief fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management. "This is an area where Japan has competitive strength and I thought it (Toshiba Ceramics) would become an attractive company with some support. I am a little disappointed," Akino said. Washington-based Carlyle raised 216 billion yen in July, the largest ever for a Japan-dedicated buyout fund. Its portfolio of companies in Japan has included mobile services firm Willcom Inc. and crane maker Kito Corp. Japan-based buyout fund Unison has invested in such Japanese companies as Kanebo Ltd. and the $1.5 billion management buyout of condominium maker Recruit Cosmos Co., Ltd last year. Private equity has been involved in $23.7 billion worth of acquisitions in Japan so far this year, or 114 transactions, more than three times the level during the same period last year of $7.23 billion in 63 deals, Dealogic said.
