 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Eastman Kodak Co.EK.N, the world's top maker of photographic film, on Tuesday posted its eighth consecutive quarterly loss, but cost cuts helped results top Wall Street expectations and the company's shares rose 5 percent. 

 Kodak, which is undergoing a lengthy and expensive transformation into a maker of digital cameras and printing products and services, said its 2006 loss will be smaller than previously forecast, adding that its shift remains "on track." The company, however, warned that digital revenue growth in the year would fall short of its 10-percent goal as it focuses on selling products that generate higher profits. Since late 2003, Kodak has focused on digital devices, hoping to outpace the drop in demand for film, historically its main revenue source. At the same time, it is reducing costs by cutting up to 27,000 jobs and trimming manufacturing. "The consumer digital group (has begun) to realize the benefit of trading unprofitable revenue growth for margin expansion, especially in the area of digital cameras and in printer docks," said Kodak Chief Executive Antonio Perez, on a conference call. Rochester, New York-based Kodak posted a net loss of $37 million, or 13 cents a share, compared with a loss of $914 million, or $3.18 a share, a year earlier, when it took a $778 million tax-related charge. Excluding restructuring costs and other special items, the company had a profit of was 44 cents per share, handily exceeding analysts' average expectation of 19 cents. Third-quarter revenue slipped to $3.2 billion from $3.55 billion, falling short of the analysts' view of $3.28 billion. Digital revenue fell 1.2 percent, and traditional film sales declined by 19 percent. RESULTS DIFFICULT TO GAUGE Wall Street analysts have found it difficult to measure Kodak's overall health due to the constant restructuring over the past three years. While some units have grown and added workers, others are cutting operations and jobs. "As long as they continue to do (so many) charges, you are not going to see a lot of upside from this stock," said Tom Carroll, vice president of research for Bullfinch Funds, who says he no longer owns Kodak shares. Overall, analysts characterized the quarter as mixed. "They are decreasing costs faster than revenues are declining, but top line is not growing as fast as the Street had hoped," said Cross Research analyst Shannon Cross. "The concern is that digital revenue is decelerating pretty dramatically." Kodak said it now expects 2006 total revenue to be down 6 percent, with a loss from continuing operations of $400 million to $600 million. In August, Kodak forecast a loss of $500 million to $850 million from continuing operations, with full-year revenue declining 3 percent. The company deflected analysts' questions on the call about the future of its health unit and long-standing plans to introduce inkjet printers, saying that news in those areas would be announced before the end of the year. One year ago, Kodak posted a large noncash charge to write down of the value of deferred tax assets as a result of current and expected U.S. losses from its extensive restructuring launched in January 2004. Kodak shares were up 93 cents at $24.68 in afternoon morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange.
