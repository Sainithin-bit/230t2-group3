 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Casino operator Trump Entertainment Resorts Inc. TRMP.O on Tuesday said third-quarter profit increased 81.3 percent helped by higher sales, including gambling and room revenue. 

 Net profit rose to $5.8 million, or 19 cents per share, from $3.2 million, or 12 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter. Analysts, on average, expected the company to post a profit of 19 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Atlantic City, New Jersey-based Trump Entertainment, which emerged from bankruptcy protection in May 2005, has been revamping operations, upgrading properties and focusing on improved customer service under a new management. The company, which was started by real estate mogul Donald Trump, said net revenue in the third quarter rose 4 percent to $288.4 million.
