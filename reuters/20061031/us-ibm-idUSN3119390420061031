 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - IBM ( IBM.N ), the world's largest technology services company, said on Tuesday that its board approved $4 billion in new funds to repurchase stock. 

 The $4 billion is in addition to about $2.4 billion for stock repurchases remaining from a $4 billion authorization that its board made in April. IBM is spending billions of dollars on share buybacks to help boost its stock price, whose performance has lagged behind that of some key rivals over the past year. The computer giant's stock has risen 10 percent during that period, while Hewlett-Packard Co. ( HPQ.N ) is up 44 percent and Accenture Ltd. ( ACN.N ) has gained 24 percent during the same period. International Business Machines also said its board of directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of 30 cents per common share, payable December 9, to stockholders of record on November 10. It is the third consecutive quarter in which IBM has declared a dividend of 30 cents per share. In April the company's board raised that dividend from 20 cents a share. IBM shares rose 59 cents to $92.09 on Tuesday. (Additional reporting by  Jim Finkle  in Boston.)
