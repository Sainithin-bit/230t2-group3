 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Procter & Gamble Co. ( PG.N ) posted a better-than-expected 33 percent jump in quarterly profit on Tuesday as the addition of products such as Gillette razors led to strong sales and the company slightly raised its full-year view due to easing commodity and energy costs. 

 But the high end of P&G's profit view for the current quarter just meets the average forecast already expected by Wall Street and P&G shares slipped as much as 2 percent before staging a bit of a rebound. "We're more concerned with what the long term prospects of the company are and I think those are still very favorable," said Eric Schoenstein, co-manager of the Jensen Portfolio, which held 1.75 million P&G shares as of September. "I didn't hear anything this morning that made me change my thoughts about where they were headed." P&G, whose products range from Pampers diapers to Iams dog food, said it sees costs improving after facing higher prices for oil-based materials and transportation in recent quarters. "This is the first company I've seen to publicly say that commodity costs will benefit them over the next few quarters and, hopefully, that will be the first shot across the bow for all companies in the ... sector," said SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analyst Bill Chappell, who has a "buy" rating on the shares. The cost of raw materials and energy should still be up this year, but the amount of the increases should be lower in the past two years, Chief Financial Officer Clayt Daley said during a conference call. Profit rose to $2.7 billion, or 79 cents per share, in the fiscal first quarter ended September 30, from $2.03 billion, or 77 cents, a year earlier. The results topped analysts' average view by a penny per share and came in ahead of P&G's own forecast of 76 cents to 78 cents per share. Sales soared 27 percent to $18.79 billion, beating Wall Street's $18.61 billion forecast, driven by new items such as redesigned Herbal Essences hair care products and the addition of Gillette razors, batteries and toothbrushes. "These results will not create skeptics, but we do not think they will create many new believers in PG shares at this valuation," wrote Bear Stearns analyst Justin Hott, who has a "peer perform" rating on P&G, in a research note. P&G shares have risen 3 percent since the company's fiscal year started on October 1, in line with the Dow Jones Industrial average  .DJI , of which it is a component. The shares trade at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 18.6 times. Competitor Colgate-Palmolive Co. ( CL.N ) trades at 19.6 times, while Unilever Plc ( ULVR.L ) trades at 14.7 times. COMMODITIES EASE; GILLETTE ON TRACK Cincinnati-based P&G bought Gillette in October 2005, so the year-ago period did not include any results from Gillette. Sales excluding the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange, rose 6 percent, after being up 8 percent in the fourth quarter. Commodity costs hit gross margin by about 1 percentage point, but that pressure was offset in part by price increases and the addition of Gillette. Gross margin rose 1.2 percentage points to 52.8 percent of sales. Daley said P&G forecasts oil will cost $60 to $65 per barrel this year and expects some relief from suppliers' higher prices in the second half of the fiscal year. The company has already announced a price increase on Duracell batteries due to high zinc prices, but will not see the benefit until the second half of the year, he said. P&G said operating margins should improve by 0.5 to 1 percentage point in the current quarter and by more than 1 percentage point this year, driven by improved gross margins. The company now expects to earn $2.97 to $3.02 per share this year, including a hit of 12 cents to 18 cents per share from Gillette. It previously expected to earn $2.96 to $3.00 per share with the same impact from Gillette. Analysts had been calling for a profit of $3.00 for the fiscal year, which ends in June. P&G still expects full year sales excluding mergers and the impact of foreign exchange to rise by 4 percent to 6 percent and total sales growth of 9 percent to 11 percent. For the current quarter, P&G forecast earnings of 81 cents to 83 cents per share, while analysts had expected a profit of 83 cents per share. P&G forecast organic sales growth of 4 percent to 7 percent in the quarter. Daley said the integration of Gillette is still on track and the company expects to complete most of the job cuts related to the deal by year end. The shares, which set a new high of $64.02 on Monday, were down 59 cents at $63.22 on Tuesday afternoon after falling to $62.50.
