 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - MetLife Inc. ( MET.N ), the largest U.S. life insurer, said on Monday that earnings rose 33 percent in the third quarter, helped by record premiums. 

 New York City-based MetLife said earnings were $999 million, or $1.29 a share, up from $742 million or 97 cents a share in the year-earlier quarter. MetLife said operating earnings, which analysts use to measure performance because it excludes investment gains and losses, were $958 million or $1.24 a share. Analysts on average had expected the life insurer to earn $1.17 a share, according to Reuters estimates. "It was a huge quarter for MetLife," said Will Retzer of SNL Financial, who does not rate the stock. "They beat all the earnings estimates and set the tone for the rest of the year. In the year-ago quarter, MetLife earned $780 million or $1.01 a share in operating earnings. However, on a sequential basis, MetLife's earnings were not as impressive, said Douglas Meyer, an analyst with Fitch Ratings. He noted that second-quarter operating net was $982 million or $1.28 a share. One sour note was MetLife's institutional business, where operating earnings remained relatively flat with year ago levels due to lower interest rate spreads in the retirement and savings business. "That was worrisome because institutional business is typically one of their biggest drivers," said Celent analyst Donald Light, who noted that the latest figure of $390 million was off by $63 million from the second quarter. Light said he has a small position in MetLife. The insurer, ranked as the biggest by rating firm A.M. Best, said in June that it expected to earn $4.55 to $4.75 a share for the year with the help of its 2005 acquisition of Travelers Life & Annuity from Citigroup Inc. ( C.N ) in 2005. Since the start of the year, MetLife shares rose nearly 21 percent compared to a 4.3 percent gain for the Standard & Poor's insurance .GSPINSC. It trades at a price to earnings multiple of 12 compared to 14.7 for a group of comparable insurers. After the close. the shares drifted higher in after-hours trading. MetLife also benefited from the sale of its 80-acres (32 hectares) of New York apartments on Manhattan's East Side earlier this month to a real estate venture and a private equity firm for $5.4 billion, nearly $500 million higher than most expected. The sale of the 11,000 apartments will result in a gain to MetLife of about $3 billion before the year ends, and analysts have predicted the company could use at least part of that for a share buyback or increase in the dividend. "With all this new capital, I wouldn't be surprised to see more merger and acquisition activity," said Retzer. MetLife said it intended to resume its share repurchase program in the fourth quarter and currently has $716 million remaining on its existing authorization. MetLife said that it had record total premiums, fees and other revenue of $8.1 billion in the third quarter and reached $516.2 billion in total assets. Auto and home operating earnings were $107 million compared to a loss in the year ago quarter when hurricanes hit, while total life earnings and earnings from annuities both increased 11 percent.
