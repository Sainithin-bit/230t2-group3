 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Bra and underwear maker Hanesbrands Inc. ( HBI.N ) on Tuesday said net income sank on rising interest expenses, sliding operating profit and higher income taxes during its first quarter as a publicly traded company. 

 The maker of Playtex, Wonderbra and Hanes undergarments, which food company Sara Lee Corp. SLE.N spun off in early September, said net income had fallen to $50.3 million, or 52 cents per share, from $82.6 million, or 86 cents a share, a year earlier. For the quarter ended September 30, sales dropped 1.7 percent to $1.12 billion as the company exited from low-margin product lines and suffered from declining sales of sheer hosiery. The company is only followed by one analyst, according to Reuters Research, so no accurate Wall Street comparisons are possible. Winston-Salem, North Carolina-based Hanesbrands, which also makes Champion brand T-shirts and active wear, has been closing U.S. manufacturing plants and cutting jobs to make its operations more efficient. On October 26, the company announced a purchase of a sewing operation in Thailand as a low-cost supply chain. OUTLOOK The company did not give specific guidance for its next fiscal year, which will stretch from December 31, 2006 to December 29, 2007. Instead, it said the "current annual sales run rate of approximately $4.5 billion reflects a good baseline from which to build." The company warned it will incur higher costs as a stand-alone company and said it plans to increase investment behind its strategies. Still, it will offset expenses with cost reductions and benefit from cutting corporate allocations related to its previous Sara Lee ownership. Under these conditions, it expects its operating profit margin in the next fiscal year, excluding restructuring, to approach 9-1/2 percent, similar to the operating margin in its most recently completed fiscal year ended July 1, 2006. Overall growth goals include long-term annual revenue growth of 1 percent to 3 percent, excluding acquisitions and long-term annual operating profit growth of 6 percent to 8 percent, excluding the effect of restructuring charges. The company also expects long-term annual double-digit growth in earnings per share, excluding restructuring charges. Shares of Hanesbrands closed at $24.25 on Monday. The stock is up 23 percent since its spin off on September 5 and is selling for 11.3 times next year's expected earnings, compared with 15.6 times competitor Kellwood Co. KWD.N.
