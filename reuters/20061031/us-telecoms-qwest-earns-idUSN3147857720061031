 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Regional telephone company Qwest Communications International Inc. ( Q.N ) on Tuesday reported a third-quarter profit from a year-ago loss as it cut costs, but shares fell 3 percent on a disappointing cash flow forecast. 

 Analysts also voiced concern over competition the company faces from cable providers offering all-in-one packages of video, voice, and Internet after the data showed a fall in access lines. "I think they're starting to show competition from Comcast ( CMCSA.O ) and Cox," said Janco Partners analyst Donna Jaegers of the two cable operators. While lower spending helped improve Qwest's balance sheet, it may also be hindering its battle against cable companies that are aggressively marketing high-speed Internet and voice services, Jaegers said. Qwest, which provides local service in 14 states in the western United States, reported profit of $194 million, or 9 cents per share, compared with a loss of $144 million, or 8 cents per share, in the same period a year earlier. Analysts expected earnings of 7 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Operating revenue fell to $3.49 billion from $3.50 billion in 2005, when it recognized $52 million from a large government contract. The figure was in line with analysts' estimates. The company, which has struggled over the past few years to reduce massive debt, said net debt dropped to $13.7 billion at the end of the quarter, down $800 million from end-2005. Operating expenses fell 6.3 percent to $3.1 billion with improved productivity, operating efficiencies and lower facilities costs. The expenses also included $43 million in severance charges. Qwest, like bigger peers AT&T Inc. ( T.N ) and Verizon Communications ( VZ.N ), has been helped by a rise in Internet subscriptions as traditional phone subscriptions declined. The company added over 175,000 high-speed Internet lines in the third quarter, a rise of 47 percent from last year and 10 percent sequentially. But some analysts also noted a 6 percent fall in Qwest's total access lines as evidence of increased competition from the cable industry. FREE CASH FLOW DISAPPOINTS Helped by lower debt and spending, Qwest generated free cash flow of $358 million in the quarter, bringing the year-to-date total to $803 million -- nearly 70 percent higher than a year earlier. But analysts said such improvements had mostly been priced into the shares, which have surged 60 percent since the start of the year, and that they had hoped the company would upgrade its free cash flow forecast. Instead, the company reiterated its guidance for free cash flow in a range of $1.35 billion to $1.5 billion. In October, Qwest said it would buy back up to $2 billion of its stock, but did not announce a dividend as many investors had hoped. Qwest Chairman and Chief Executive Richard Notebaert on Tuesday said the company was "reviewing on a regular basis opportunities to enhance shareholder returns." Atlantic Equity analyst Chris Watts said he saw chances of a dividend in a few years' time. "We do see the possibility of a dividend payment in the medium term, perhaps two years down the road," he said. He has a $10 price target on the shares for end-2007. Qwest stock fell 28 cents, or 3.11 percent, to $8.73 on the New York Stock Exchange. Their 60 percent rise so far this year compares to a 22 percent rise in the AMEX North American Telecom Index .XTC of its peers over the same time period.
