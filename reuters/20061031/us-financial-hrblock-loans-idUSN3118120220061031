 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - H&R Block Inc., trying to distance itself from accusations it overcharges customers, on Tuesday said it will disclose more about tax-refund loans, and warn clients who have debt that might affect the loan process. 

 The changes concern refund-anticipation loans, which are short-term cash advances by the tax-return preparer to clients who expect refunds. In September, H&R Block said it will slash fees on typical refund loans by more than 40 percent. Kansas City, Missouri-based H&R Block offers the loans through a partnership with a U.S. unit of Britain's HSBC Holdings Plc. Under the new process, borrowers will receive a chart showing filing options, fees and the time it takes to obtain refunds. H&R Block will also notify prospective borrowers if they have outstanding fees from tax preparation or prior refund loans that might affect lending decisions. Mark Ernst, H&R Block's chief executive, in a statement said the changes are intended to make H&R Block's disclosure policies industry-leading. Spokeswoman Linda McDougall said the changes were "not inspired by litigation." A copy of the new disclosures was not immediately available. Refund loans are typically extended for less than two weeks, and many go to poor customers. Their fees result in high effective annualized interest rates that can reach three digits. On August 28, U.S. District Judge Elaine Bucklo in Chicago approved a $39 million settlement to end an eight-year-old class-action lawsuit against H&R Block over the loans. California Attorney General Bill Lockyer in February accused H&R Block in a separate lawsuit of overcharging borrowers. Under its new fee schedule, H&R Block said a typical $2,800 refund loan might cost as little as $60, equating to a 36 percent annual interest rate, if customers open H&R Block bank accounts and arrange for refunds to be deposited directly into them. The company has said it hopes to open 1 million bank accounts by April. H&R Block also faces a lawsuit by New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer over what he calls excessive fees on its Express IRA retirement accounts. Defaults have risen at a mortgage unit, and H&R Block has lost market share to Jackson Hewitt Tax Service Inc. H&R Block shares rose 29 cents to $21.87 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
