 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japan's Toshiba Corp. doubled its first-half net profit and raised its full-year profit forecast by 22 percent, driven by gains in the power segment, but problems in the very same segment caused bigger rival Hitachi Ltd. to post a larger loss. 

 Toshiba, Japan's second-largest electronics conglomerate, raised its annual profit forecast to 110 billion yen ($936.9 million), above a consensus estimate of 95.6 billion yen from 18 analysts polled by Reuters, boosted by sales of its electric power systems and planned sales of assets, including its stake in chip wafer maker Toshiba Ceramics Co. Ltd. Japan's big industrial electronics makers have been struggling for years to trim down their many businesses, to better compete with global competition. Toshiba, in particular, is focusing on the energy business, having earlier this month taken a 77 percent stake in Westinghouse, the U.S. power plant unit of British Nuclear Fuels, for $4.16 billion. But Hitachi, Japan's biggest electronics conglomerate with more than 300,000 employees, has fallen behind in deciding what units and subsidiaries to let go, said analysts and an investor. "I think the earnings confirmed relative firmness in Toshiba versus its rivals," such as Hitachi or NEC Corp., said Shozui Kobayashi, assistant fund manager at United Investments Co. Toshiba, the world's No. 2 maker of NAND flash memory after South Korea's Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd., earned a first-half net profit of 38.83 billion yen, with profits in its chip business growing 15.4 percent from the previous year. Gains from power systems outweighed lower-than-expected chip profit, hit by NAND flash memory prices falls of 50 percent in the six months to the end of September, Toshiba Corporate Executive Vice President Fumio Muraoka said. "The Christmas shopping season is coming up, and we expect NAND price falls to slow down in the second half," he said of NAND flash memory, used in digital music players like Apple Computer Inc.'s iPod. "In the meantime, we will accelerate globalisation of the power systems business." In contrast, at Hitachi, which makes everything from vacuum cleaners to nuclear energy plants, price falls were exacerbated by additional losses in the power business. Hitachi posted a loss that was seven times bigger than the previous year, and projected a net loss of 55 billion yen for the year to March on bigger-than-expected drops in hard disk drive prices, cost overruns at its U.S. coal-fired thermal power plant and repairs of Hitachi-designed turbines that caused shut downs at nuclear power generators at two Japanese utilities. The utility firms said last week they might seek compensation from Hitachi for lost revenues and increased costs due to the shut downs. Hitachi's hard disk drive segment would remain in the red this year, and would not regain profitability until next business year, Hitachi Executive Vice President Takashi Miyoshi said. Hitachi posted a net loss of 78.1 billion yen, in line with analyst estimates after the company cut its first-half and annual forecasts last month. Toshiba shares rose 12 percent, while Hitachi shares tumbled 17 percent in the April to September period. The Tokyo market's electrical machinery index fell 4.38 percent.
