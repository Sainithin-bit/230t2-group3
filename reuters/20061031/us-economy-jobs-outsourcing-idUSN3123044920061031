 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Pressure on the U.S. labor market from the outsourcing of traditionally white-collar jobs is just starting to build, according to a new study. 

 Fortune 500 companies could potentially save $58 billion annually, or some $116 million per company, by offshoring general and administrative jobs, according to the Hackett Group, a strategic advisory firm. Hackett will formally issue the study next week. The study estimates that increased use of cheaper overseas labor could affect up to 1.47 million back-office jobs, or nearly 3,000 at a typical Fortune 500 company. Some of the job functions that can now more readily be shipped overseas than they could several years ago include IT, finance, human resources and procurement, the group said. "Over the past few years, the resources available offshore have matured to an extent no one could have imagined, creating a paradigm shift that companies can ignore only at their peril," said Julio Ramirez, Hackett managing director. The education base and skill set, and with it the potential savings on labor costs, is on the rise in India, China, the Philippines, Pakistan, Eastern Europe, Brazil and other emerging countries, the Hackett study contends. Many companies are relying on outdated analysis to assess the benefits of outsourcing, and risk "under-scoping" such initiatives, Hackett said. But once they get up to speed, it could be "Katie bar the (office) door." Hackett is a division of Answerthink Inc. ANSR.O, a business and technology consulting firm.
