 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The chief financial officer of water cooler company Aquacell Technologies Inc. AQUAE.OB pleaded guilty on Tuesday to concealing material information about the company's $6 million initial public offering from its accountants. 

 Gary Wolff of Edgewater, New Jersey, admitted to lying to auditors in Manhattan federal court before U.S. District Judge Gerard Lynch. He faces a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison and a fine of $1 million. Prosectors said Wolff, 68, and others loaned a potential investor $1.75 million to buy shares in Aquacell's IPO and then lied to the company's accountants about the transaction. "He is getting this behind him," Peter Driscoll, Wolff's lawyer, told reporters after the hearing. Sentencing is set for January 26.
