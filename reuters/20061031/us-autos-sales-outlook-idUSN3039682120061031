 DETROIT  (Reuters) - U.S. auto sales are on track to finish October stronger than a year ago, but without enough momentum for Detroit to sell out its inventory of 2006 models, analysts said on Monday. 

 Automakers are due to report October sales on Wednesday. The data will be closely watched for how the traditional Big Three U.S. car companies are managing unsold 2006 models. The persistent inventory problem is particularly pressing for Chrysler Group, the U.S. arm of DaimlerChrysler AG DCXGn.DE, which ended September with 533,220 unsold vehicles, or an 82-day supply on its dealer lots, the highest tally in the industry. Chrysler's dealer inventory in September was down 7 percent from a year earlier but remained higher than inventory levels for GM, which had a 76-day supply of cars, and Ford, which had 74. However, analysts said lower gas prices may have helped General Motors Corp. ( GM.N ), Ford Motor Co. ( F.N ) and Chrysler sell some of their pricier trucks and SUVs, which were shunned by consumers for most of this year. Overall sales are also expected to look better in comparison to October 2005, which marked a seven-year low for U.S. auto sales after a summer of showroom discounts by GM, Ford and Chrysler, analysts said. Goldman Sachs analyst Robert Barry forecast overall sales would come in at an annualized rate of 16.4 million units, up from 14.8 million a year earlier. Barry forecast a 26 percent year-on-year increase for GM, which he said would mark a "modest" increase because of the No. 1 automaker's 23-percent sales decline a year earlier. He said he expected Ford to post a 14-percent sales gain, which he called "weak" given its 23-percent drop a year ago. Bear Stearns analyst Peter Nesvold forecast an 18-percent sales gain for GM and a 10-percent rise for Ford. "Inventory appears to be building for the Big Three and incentives are picking up modestly," he said. Executives have been cautious in their public assessments. "We look a lot like last (September)," GM sales analyst Paul Ballew said last week. "We're seeing a pretty strong truck mix. We are having a good month on full-size pickups." George Pipas, Ford's sales analyst, said any bounce in truck sales in October would not change the downtrend as consumers seek more fuel-efficient cars and "crossover" vehicles. "I wouldn't characterize it as a return to normal," he said. "You may see some strength, but I don't think it's sustainable until the economic fundamentals improve." CHRYSLER UNDER SPOTLIGHT Chrysler is forecast to end October with the weakest relative sales among the Big Three, with forecasts ranging between a 3-percent decline and a 6-percent gain. The company, which has slipped to fourth-place in the U.S. market behind a surging Toyota Motor Corp.( 7203.T ), said last week it had another 50,000 vehicles unassigned to any dealers and without an immediate destination in addition to its disclosed dealer inventory. Other U.S. automakers have moved away from such "sales banks" of unsold vehicles. Chrysler, which blamed its inventory problem on a $1.48 billion third-quarter operating loss, plans to sell all of the vehicles in its sales bank and reduce inventory to "the low 500 to thousands" by year end, spokesman Kevin McCormick said. "We have a sales plan that we're implementing right now with our dealers," McCormick said. Jesse Toprak, an analyst at Edmunds.com, estimated that Chrysler spent an average of $4,200 on sales incentives on its vehicles in October, flat from September. GM and Ford, by contrast, both spent less and cut back on such costly offers, he said. "Chrysler is having to spend more than the others," he said.
