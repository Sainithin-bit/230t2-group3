  By  David Bailey CHICAGO  Oct 31 (Reuters) - Auto parts maker Visteon Corp.
( VC.N ) on Tuesday posted a wider-than-expected quarterly loss,
hurt by production cuts at North American automakers, and said
it would eliminate 900 salaried jobs, or 5.6 percent of its
white-collar work force.  Visteon, which completed a bailout by former parent Ford
Motor Co. ( F.N ) in 2005 and announced a further three years of
restructuring in January, slashed its full-year earnings
forecast and said it expects negative free cash flow this
year.  In September, the company warned that second-half results
would be pressured by automakers' production cuts and a shift
away from sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks toward
smaller vehicles. It expects conditions to remain challenging
into 2007.  "The results were not surprising, given Ford's problems,"
Morningstar analyst John Novak said. "They are obviously in a
restructuring mode here, so I think people were expecting a
tough quarter."  Visteon's net loss narrowed to $177 million, or $1.38 per
share, in the third quarter, from $207 million, or $1.64 per
share, a year earlier.  Analysts, on average, expected a loss of 79 cents per
share, according to Reuters Estimates.  The net loss included $14 million of restructuring expenses
that qualify for reimbursement from an account established in
the Ford deal to fund restructuring.  The company's restructuring makes comparisons with
year-earlier figures difficult, and those issues will continue
for several years, Fitch Ratings Managing Director Mark Oline
said.  "Given the pressures in the environment and the production
cuts at major customers, they will be challenged to reverse
that (negative cash flow) in 2007," Oline added.  Visteon reported third-quarter sales of $2.62 billion,
including $133 million from services. Analysts expected $2.56
billion.  Product sales to Ford totaled $1.09 billion, or 44 percent
of the total, down from 64 percent a year earlier.  JOB CUTS  The 900 white-collar job cuts will be made in high-cost
countries such as the United States, Visteon said. The cuts
represent 5.6 percent of the company's 16,000 salaried jobs,
and 13 percent of the salaried jobs in high-cost countries.  The Van Buren Township, Michigan, company has about 46,000
employees worldwide.  Visteon expects to take a charge of up to $65 million in
the fourth quarter for the job cuts, which should qualify for
reimbursement from the restructuring account. It said it
expects the cuts to save up to $75 million a year.  In a conference call, executives said Visteon advised
employees of the planned cuts on Monday. It expects to complete
most of the cuts by the end of the 2007 first quarter. The cuts
do not include salaried workers leased to Ford.  In 2005, Ford agreed to buy back 23 Visteon facilities that
employed thousands of high-wage union workers, and to help fund
additional Visteon restructuring.  In January, the auto parts maker outlined plans to deal
with 23 more facilities. So far, it has closed five, expects to
close one more, and plans to retain one. It has received bids
on four facilities it wants to sell.  In the third quarter, Visteon added plans to close its
Chicago facility and exit its Vitro Flex glass joint venture.  The deal with Ford cut Visteon's revenue by about 40
percent, and the company has narrowed its focus to interiors,
climate control and electronics, where new business is
concentrated.  Visteon cut its 2006 outlook for earnings before net
interest expense, income taxes and extraordinary items and
excluding unreimbursed restructuring costs and impairment of
long-lived assets.  It said it now expects earnings on that basis of $40
million to $50 million, down from an August forecast for $170
million to $200 million. It said it expects free cash flow to
be negative $100 million for 2006.  Shares of Visteon were down 4 cents at $7.22 in morning
trade on the New York Stock Exchange.
