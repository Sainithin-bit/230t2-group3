 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Cummins Inc. ( CMI.N ), a diesel engine maker, said on Tuesday third-quarter earnings rose 18 percent, as the effort to rebuild Iraq's infrastructure, which was shattered by the war and insurgency, powered strong sales of its power generation and distribution products. 

 Sales at its key diesel engine unit rose 10 percent during the quarter, reflecting the rush by North American truckers to update their fleets ahead of tough, new U.S. emissions rules next year that will require more expensive engines. The Columbus, Indiana-based company said third-quarter profit jumped to $171 million, or $3.37 a share, from $145 million, or $2.90 a share, a year earlier. Sales rose 14 percent to $2.81 billion, despite steep production cuts by some of the Detroit automakers it supplies. Analysts, on average, expected net profit of $3.68 a share and a profit from continuing operations of $3.65 a share on sales of $2.74 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. Looking forward, the company sees earnings between $14 and $14.20 a share for the full year. Analysts, on average, expected $14.33 a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Cummins said the standout segments were power generation, where sales rose 24 percent, and power distribution, up 17 percent. Cummins said more than one-half of those gains came as a result of the "reconstruction efforts in the Middle East."
