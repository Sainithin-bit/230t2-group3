 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - American Electric Power Co. Inc. ( AEP.N ), one of the largest U.S. utilities, on Tuesday posted lower third-quarter earnings, hurt by a charge from the sale of a power plant. 

 The company, which generates and distributes electricity in 11 states, said net income fell to $265 million, or 67 cents per share, from $376 million, or 99 cents per share a year earlier. The company said third-quarter earnings included a $136 million charge from the sale of its Plaquemine Cogeneration plant in Louisiana to Dow Chemical Co. ( DOW.N ). The profit also included some gains from the sales of other assets. Excluding these items, the company said it earned 99 cents a share in the quarter, in line with the average forecast of analysts polled by Reuters Estimates. AEP shares were up 25 cents at $41.31 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. AEP had been helped by a rate increase at its Ohio utility and would likely see other utility rate hikes to reflect spending on environmental upgrades, said Daniele Seitz, analyst at Dahlman Rose. "The company should be able to grow its earnings at a faster pace than before," said Seitz. Solid results from its MEMCO barge unit, which transports bulk commodities such as coal and grain, helped boost operating income 6 percent from the year-earlier period. "MEMCO is having an outstanding year," Chief Executive Michael Morris said in a prepared statement. "The higher rates included in 2006 contracts were driven by strong demand for barge capacity and a tight supply of barges." The company's utility unit benefited from rate increases in Ohio and higher wholesale margins. But those factors were offset by milder weather, higher operating expenses and reduced federal transmission rates. Columbus, Ohio-based AEP still expects to earn between $2.65 to $2.80 per share for 2006. Since the beginning of the year, AEP shares have gained about 11 percent, lagging the Standard and Poor's utility index .GSPU gain of some 14 percent. The utility index is trading near multiyear highs, after declining late last year as a result of interest rate and inflation concerns. The U.S. Federal Reserve's decision to pause its cycle of interest rate increases has fueled the sector to continue its rebound from the power industry's severe downturn in 2002.
