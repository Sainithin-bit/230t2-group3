 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. consumer confidence and growth in business activity in the Midwest ebbed in October, economic data showed on Tuesday, spurring market expectations the Federal Reserve could trim interest rates next year to bolster growth. 

 But a rise in employment costs at the strongest rate in more than two years in the third quarter suggested inflation would remain a concern for policy-makers. "Incoming data are still pointing toward slower growth and eventual rate cuts," said Avery Shenfeld, economist at CIBC World Markets in Toronto, adding however that "the Fed is in a watchful, waiting stance and will need to see a couple more quarters of sluggish growth before they will turn to talk of an ease." The business barometer from the National Association of Purchasing Management-Chicago fell to 53.5 this month, below economists' expectations of a reading of 58.0, from 62.1 in September. A reading above 50 indicates expansion. During the same period, U.S. consumer confidence slipped to 105.4 from an upwardly revised 105.9 in September, according to The Conference Board. The median forecast from economists was for a reading of 108.0 for October. Taken together, the two pieces of data pointed to a slowing U.S. economy, economists said. U.S. government bond prices rose following the business activity and confidence data, having earlier slipped after the employment cost figures. U.S. stock markets pared gains, while the dollar fell. The Employment Cost Index, a broad gauge of what employers pay in wages and benefits, rose by a larger-than-expected 1.0 percent in the third quarter, marking the largest increase since the second quarter of 2004. The rise was above the second quarter of 2006's 0.9 percent gain and was larger than the 0.9 percent rise economists in a Reuters poll had forecast, Labor Department data showed. Separate data painted a mixed picture for chain store sales. U.S. chain store retail sales declined slightly in the latest week, after falling in the previous week, according to a report jointly released by the International Council of Shopping Centers and UBS. Sales slipped 0.2 percent in the week ended October 28, compared with a 1.1 percent decrease in the previous week. However, compared with the same week a year ago, chain store sales rose 2.3 percent. Another gauge of chain store sales, the Redbook index, showed chain store sales rising 3.3 percent for the week ended October 28 from the same time a year ago after a 3.2 percent rise the week before. In other data, New York city companies reported better business conditions in October, although the outlook weakened for a third month in a row. The National Association of Purchasing Management-New York's index of local business activity climbed to 425.3 in October from 421.0 in September. (Additional reporting by Joanne Morrison)
