 LONDON  (Reuters) - Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BoAML) ( BAC.N ) said on Wednesday it had hired UBS ( UBSN.VX ) corporate broker Peter Luck, helping to bolster a team depleted by a string of senior departures. 
 Luck, who will be a managing director in the corporate broking team, will take up his role in June, a spokeswoman for BoAML said. He had been a managing director in corporate broking at UBS for the past three years. A mainly British phenomenon, corporate brokers offer advice to clients for minimal fees, usually in the hope of winning their bank more lucrative business, such as M&A or equity fundraising, further down the line. They also act as a go-between for their clients and investors. Last month BoAML lost its London-based head of corporate broking Mark Astaire to Barclays Capital ( BARC.L ), while Simon Fraser, previously co-head of the unit, retired at the end of last year. Also in February, Andrew Osborne, a managing director in BoAML's corporate broking team who has now left the bank, was fined 350,000 pounds ($550,700) by Britain's financial regulator in a high profile market abuse case. BoAML, which has 28 FTSE 100 corporate broking clients, hired four new managing directors in the business last year. Luck will report to Simon Mackenzie-Smith, chairman of the bank's UK & Ireland Corporate & Investment Banking business. The changes come as a fight for corporate broking clients hots up in Britain, as banks eye the clients of Hoare Govett after Royal Bank of Scotland ( RBS.L ) sold the business to Jefferies JEF.N.
