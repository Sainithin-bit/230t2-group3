 BEIJING  (Reuters) - Social and legal injustice are causing discontent in Chinese society, Premier Wen Jiabao said on Wednesday, as he pledged to formulate a plan aimed at reforming income distribution during his final year in office. 
 Wen, who was speaking at a news conference at the end of the annual meeting of parliament, also said he will introduce farmland requisition compensation rules and aims for full nationwide old-age pension coverage this year.
