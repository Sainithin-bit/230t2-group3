 DUBAI, MARCH 14 - A U.S.-based hedge fund said it has won a $45.5 million legal claim against Dubai's Drydocks World for defaulting on a loan, putting the ship builder's $2.2 billion debt restructuring in further trouble. 
 Monarch Alternative Capital said in an emailed statement that Drydocks, a unit of Dubai World DBWLD.UL, has been ordered to pay the entirety of the sum of $45.5 million claimed plus Monarch's legal costs. Monarch sued Drydocks last year in the High Court of London casting a blow to the restructuring talks. A week ago, Drydocks proposed repaying creditors in five years and said it was seeking more working capital as it tried to restructure a $2.2 bln loan facility, ending lengthy and complex debt talks. The restructuring had been scheduled to be completed by April 2011, but it was slowed by a lack of government support and opposition from hedge fund creditors, including Monarch. When asked how the judgment would affect its restructuring Khamis Juma Buamim, Drydocks World chairman, said: "As made clear at all lender meetings, the company is confident that it can still implement its restructuring if it transpires that Monarch do not accept the terms on offer." "But I would very much hope that notwithstanding their legal action Monarch will accept the very reasonable restructuring proposal." DEBT TALKS Drydocks World's debts stem from a multibillion-dollar loan it took out to fund expansion in Singapore. Drydocks has its major ship and rig building facilities in southeast Asian countries such as Singapore and Indonesia. The $2.2 billion facility, taken out in October 2008, comprised a $1.7 billion three-year loan paying 170 basis points and a five-year $500 million loan with a 190 basis point margin, according to Thomson Reuters data. Bookrunners on the 15-lender syndicate were BNP Paribas ( BNPP.PA ), HSBC ( HSBA.L ), Mashreq MASB.DU, Standard Chartered ( STAN.L ) and Lloyds Banking Group ( LLOY.L ) among others. Presence of hedge funds is seen complicating debt restructurings in the Gulf Arab region, where previous negotiations have been bank-only affairs. Another U.S. hedge fund manager Davidson Kempner Capital Management is part of the creditor committee for the $1.1 billion debt restructuring at Bahrain investment house Arcapita ARCAB.UL, the first time a fund has fulfilled such a role in the region.
