 SHANGHAI  (Reuters) - China Southern Airlines ( 600029.SS )( 1055.HK )( ZNH.N ), the country's largest carrier by fleet size, said on Sunday that it had returned to the black last year. 

 Strong growth in traffic and appreciation of the yuan against the dollar helped the company post a profit in 2006 after a 1.79 billion yuan (now $230 million) net loss in 2005, the company said in a brief statement to the Shanghai Stock Exchange. It did not elaborate beyond saying detailed figures would be revealed when the airline announced full-year results. The announcement is expected around March or April. In the first nine months of this year, net profit jumped to 453 million yuan from 9 million yuan a year earlier. ($1 = 7.77 yuan)
