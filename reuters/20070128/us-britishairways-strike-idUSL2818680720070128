 LONDON  (Reuters) - British Airways BAY.L resumed talks with its biggest union on Sunday in a bid to avert a 48-hour cabin crew strike that could affect more than 140,000 passengers. 

 A spokeswoman for the airline said talks resumed between the two sides on Sunday morning but gave no details on progress. The strike is due to be held on Tuesday and Wednesday. A spokesman for the Transport and General Workers' Union (T&G) also confirmed that the talks were continuing but would not say any more. BA has already canceled some 1,300 flights next week in anticipation of the strike. A two-day strike would affect more than 140,000 passengers and involve most flights to and from London's Heathrow and Gatwick airports, with further disruption before and afterwards. The row centres around the airlines' policy of sick-leave and pay. The union, which says 96 percent of the cabin crew it represents are in favor of the strike, has threatened two further 72-hour strikes in February unless an agreement can be found. BA says cabin crew were taking an average of 22 sick days per year before Chief Executive Willie Walsh took charge and that under a new absence policy the figure has fallen to 12 days. Some 10,500 of BA's approximately 15,000 cabin crew are members of the T&G. The airline has urged customers to check the ba.com Web site for information.
