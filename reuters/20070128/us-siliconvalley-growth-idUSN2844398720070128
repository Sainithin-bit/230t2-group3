 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - California's Silicon Valley, which gave birth to high-tech giants Google Inc., Apple Inc. and Intel Corp., has rebooted its growth as it positions itself to be a leader on renewable energy and clean technology. 

 Silicon Valley added 33,000 jobs from the second quarter of 2005 to the second quarter of 2006 -- the first increase since 2001, according to a report to be released on Friday by Joint Venture: Silicon Valley Network. "Last year we saw the first evidence the downturn was behind us," Russell Hancock, Joint Venture's president and chief executive, said in a statement. Unemployment, which flirted with 8 percent in 2002 and 2003 as the region dealt with fallout from the dot-com bust, has fallen to around 4 percent. Average pay per employee, while on the rise, continues to lag levels seen during the tech boom. But the news was not all good. Fewer people can afford median-priced housing, high school drop-out rates are up slightly and juvenile felony offenses also rose. At the same time, more people are using publicly funded health insurance and immunization rates for blacks declined.
