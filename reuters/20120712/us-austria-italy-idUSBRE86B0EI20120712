 VIENNA  (Reuters) - Italy is not expected to request a bail-out from the European Union, Austrian Finance Minister Maria Fekter said on Thursday. 
 "We have no reason at the moment to believe that Italy will  make a request," Fekter told reporters on the sidelines of an International Monetary Fund conference in Vienna. Fekter said the EU's EFSF rescue fund had sufficient resources to meet Spanish demands and that a decision on Cyprus would be made in the coming days.
