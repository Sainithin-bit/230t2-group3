 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japanese Finance Minister Jun Azumi expressed hope on Thursday that the Bank of Japan will take measures to achieve its 1 percent inflation target at an early date. 
 "Japan will draw closer to exiting deflation if the BOJ offers financial support (to the economy) and tries to achieve its 1 percent inflation goal at an early date," Azumi told a parliamentary committee meeting. The central bank is expected to keep monetary policy on hold at a policy meeting ending on Thursday, convinced that robust domestic demand will help the country's economy resume a recovery.
