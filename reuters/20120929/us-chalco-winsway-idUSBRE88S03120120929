 HONG KONG  (Reuters) - Aluminum Corp of China (Chalco) ( 2600.HK ) has ended an agreement to buy a 29.9 percent stake in Winsway Coking Coal ( 1733.HK ) as it would not be able to win approvals from Chinese and overseas authorities by the September 30 deadline, it said in a stock exchange filing late on Friday. 
 The move comes weeks after Chalco abandoned plans to buy a majority stake in Canada's Mongolia-focused coal miner South Gobi Resources ( SGQ.TO ) due to political hurdles. Chalco had said in April that it would buy a stake in Winsway, which supplies Mongolian coking coal imported into China, for $308 million. (Reporting by Vikram Subhedar; Editing by  Daniel Magnowski )
