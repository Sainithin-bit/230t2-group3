 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The euro zone is the epicenter of a much broader sovereign debt crisis, ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet warned on Friday. 

 Trichet said that while the euro zone was the focus of financial market fears about debt-strained countries, the problem was actually wider spread. "We have in front of us a global crisis of sovereign risk and we (euro zone) are the epicenter of this global crisis," he said during a speech to the Bretton Woods committee. He added that the current situation was also more precarious than when Lehman Brothers collapsed and sent the global economy into a tailspin in late 2008, as there was no longer the belief in markets that key countries would not default on their debts.
