 LONDON  (Reuters) - Retailer Wal-Mart Stores ( WMT.N ) is setting up a team in London to drive expansion into Europe, The Independent on Sunday newspaper reported. 

 The world's largest retailer will bring a team to London to look at opportunities for European mergers and takeovers, and has hired Cushman & Wakefield to search for office space for 35-55 people, the newspaper said. Wal-Mart said in first-quarter results published on Tuesday that key U.S. sales fell 1.1 percent. At Asda, its British arm, sales growth slowed. A Wal-Mart spokeswoman told Reuters the report was "speculation dressed up as fact." (Reporting by  Lorraine Turner ; Editing by Dan Lalor)
