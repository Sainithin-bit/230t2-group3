 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Supermarket chain Supervalu ( SVU.N ) on Sunday said it is voluntarily recalling select pet food products made by Del Monte due to possible contamination. 

 The products have been recalled from Supervalu's Acme, Jewel-Osco, Shaw's, and Star Market stores as well as its Albertsons stores in the Southern California, Northwest, and Intermountain West regions.
