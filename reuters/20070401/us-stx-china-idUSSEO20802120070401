 SEOUL  (Reuters) - South Korea's STX Corp. ( 011810.KS ) said on Sunday it planned to invest an additional $800 million in China by 2009 as it set up a shipbuilding unit to cut labor costs. 

 STX, a holding company in an energy-to-shipping group, also said that it was considering listing STX Pan Ocean STXP.SI, its Singapore-listed shipping unit, on the Korea Exchange (KRX) next year at the latest. "STX will invest $1 billion in the China's shipbuilding unit by 2009 as it is better to build cheap vessels in China than here," an STX spokesman said by telephone. STX Chairman Kang Duk-soo said in a statement that its Chinese shipbuilding unit, in which STX has put $190 million so far, aimed to post sales of $3 billion by 2012. On Friday, STX held a ground-breaking ceremony for a shipyard in Dalian, which the company plans to complete by 2009. The Chinese unit won a combined $1.1 billion worth of ship orders to build 21 bulk carriers and four car vessels, STX said in a statement. Last month, STX Shipbuilding Co. ( 067250.KS ) said its Chinese affiliate is in negotiation with several shipping firms to build bulk carriers worth $500-$700 million. STX Pan Ocean also said on Thursday it had ordered four vehicle carriers for $300 million to expand its fleet. On the listing of STX Pan Ocean, Kang was quoted by the spokesman as saying the shipping firm had better to be listed next year on the KRX at the latest if the unit has to. In March, STX Pan Ocean said it was considering a listing on Seoul's main stock market to raise funds to further expand its petroleum and chemical tanker business. STX estimated it will invest $800 million in 16 new vessels this year, which will include the purchase of three new medium-ranged (MR) petroleum tankers, estimated to cost $135 million. On Friday, shares in STX ended down 2.7 percent at 30,600 won on Seoul's main stock market, with the wider market  .KS11  up 0.11 percent. STX Shipbuilding rose 0.47 percent to close at 21,200 won.
