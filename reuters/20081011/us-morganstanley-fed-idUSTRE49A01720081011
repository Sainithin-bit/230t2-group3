 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Morgan Stanley has not had discussions with the U.S. Treasury or the Federal Reserve about the government taking a stake in the bank, a person familiar with the matter said on Friday. 

 Earlier, CNBC reported that it was possible the U.S. Treasury could acquire a stake in the company. Morgan Stanley has a deal for a $9 billion investment by Japan's top bank, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc, which is expected to close on Tuesday.
