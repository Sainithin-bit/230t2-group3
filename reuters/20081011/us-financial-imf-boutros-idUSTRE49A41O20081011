 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The international community understands the gravity of the crisis that has shattered global investor confidence and will not let the financial system fail, the head of the IMF's steering committee said on Saturday. 

 "We are committed to resolving this crisis...that is not a small achievement," International Monetary and Financial Committee (IMFC) chairman Youssef Boutros-Ghali, who is Egypt's Finance Minister, told a news conference. He added that the various discussions taking place were certain to yield some concrete ideas. "I am sure from the discussions there will be a number of measures that will be in the coming days coming forward." (Reporting by  Alister Bull , Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)
