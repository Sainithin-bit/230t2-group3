 PARIS  (Reuters) - A meeting of Eurogroup heads of government in Paris will pave the way for more possibilities regarding the financial crisis, French Economy Minister Christine Lagarde said in an interview broadcast on Saturday. 

 "The Eurogroup meeting will once again open new possibilities and perhaps yield some clarification," Lagarde told France Info radio in a pre-recorded interview from Washington. (Reporting by  Tamora Vidaillet ; )
