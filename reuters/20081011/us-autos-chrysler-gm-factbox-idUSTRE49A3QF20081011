 (Reuters) - General Motors Corp and Chrysler LLC have been in preliminary talks about a potential merger, according to a source briefed on the matter. 

 A merger would unite GM, the No. 1 U.S.-based automaker, with No. 3 Chrysler, both struggling amid a 15-year low in U.S. auto industry sales and market share losses that have left them with far too much production capacity in North America. A combination of GM, whose shares fell to a nearly 60-year low this week, and Chrysler -- now about 80 percent-owned by private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management -- would create a company with too many factories, dealers, vehicle models and very similar product lines, according to analysts. As a result, such a merger would lead to massive job losses, plant closings and elimination of brands and vehicle lines, analysts said. GM and Chrysler both have extensive pickup truck and SUV lineups in North America and are in the midst of multiyear restructuring, which includes cost cuts and asset sales to raise cash.
