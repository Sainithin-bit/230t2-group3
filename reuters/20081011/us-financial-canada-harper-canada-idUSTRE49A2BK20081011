 LONDON, Ontario  (Reuters) - The Group of Seven leading industrialized nations is concerned about what it sees as the excessive measures taken by some countries to rescue troubled banks, Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper said on Saturday. 

 "I think there's some concern among the G7 that some countries are going overboard and are getting into backdoor subsidies of banks in a way that is not in the long-run interests of the marketplace," he told reporters. He did not elaborate. (Reporting by  David Ljunggren ; Editing by  Eric Walsh )
