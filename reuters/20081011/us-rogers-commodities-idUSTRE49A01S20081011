 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Investor and author Jim Rogers, one of the earliest to predict the boom in commodities of the last few years, said Friday that he recently bought agricultural commodities despite the sharp fall in prices. 

 "I've been buying agricultural commodities. I bought some a couple of days ago. It's down today. It did not matter, I bought them. I covered shorts yesterday," Rogers said on CNBC. Rogers told CNBC's Maria Bartiromo that the financial markets are in a liquidation phase. "Commodities are only thing that I can see that will not be impaired." (Reporting by  Alden Bentley )
