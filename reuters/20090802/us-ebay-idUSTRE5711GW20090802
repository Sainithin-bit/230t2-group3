 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Shares in web retailer eBay ( EBAY.O ) could be worth 30 percent more than current prices as a promised turnaround in its core online-auction business begins to yield results, weekly financial paper Barron's reported. 

 Investors would benefit from a "copious cash flow," stabilizing consumer economy, and fast growth at eBay's PayPal payment service and its Skype online phone unit, the paper said. EBay "looks like a bargain relative to similar e-commerce outfits such as Amazon.com ( AMZN.O ), which have considerably higher price/earnings multiples."
