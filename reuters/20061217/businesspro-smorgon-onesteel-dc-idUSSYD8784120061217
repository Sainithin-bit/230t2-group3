 MELBOURNE  (Reuters) - Australian steel maker Smorgon Steel 
Group Ltd. SSX.AX and its suitor OneSteel Ltd. OST.AX 
sought trading halts on their shares pending an announcement 
that sources close to the companies said was likely on Monday. 

  OneSteel made a A$1.8 billion ($1.4 billion) takeover offer 
for Smorgon in June, looking to combine Australia's two largest 
makers of long steel products such as bars, wires, pipes and 
rails.  The two companies have been in talks with potential buyers 
of Smorgon's distribution business to appease competition 
concerns.  Smorgon said in November that four groups, including 
Australian and offshore companies, had expressed interest in 
its distribution business.  Smorgon and OneSteel began the talks with those groups 
after calling off exclusive talks in November with their bigger 
rival BluesScope Steel Ltd. ( BSL.AX ) on asset sales.  BlueScope, Australia's largest steel company, bought a 19.9 
percent stake in Smorgon in August to block the merger of its 
two key customers and to talk to the companies about reshaping 
the local steel industry.  The announcement Smorgon and OneSteel are expected to make 
on Monday does not involve BlueScope.  The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission has put 
its review of the takeover on hold while OneSteel and Smorgon 
work out what to do with assets that might raise competition 
concerns.  Smorgon shares last traded at A$1.78, 18 cents below the 
implied value of OneSteel's offer, based on OneSteel's close on 
Friday at A$4.65, suggesting that investors see some risk to 
the takeover going ahead.  ($1=A$1.28)
