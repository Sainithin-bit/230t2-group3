 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. security company Brink's Co. 
( BCO.N ) may this week be urged by yet another major investor to 
sell part or all of itself, according to Barron's. 

  Millbrook Capital Management, a New York hedge fund that 
controls 8.3 percent of outstanding Brink's shares, will join 
the ranks of investors who want Brink's to consider a sale, the 
financial newspaper said in its December 18 issue.  Activist hedge fund Pirate Capital said last month Brink's 
should explore a sale of the company, start a large Dutch 
tender offer for its shares, and immediately appoint Pirate 
founder Thomas Hudson to its board.  Millbrook's proposal is expected to be outlined in a 
regulatory update of stock-ownership disclosure, the paper 
said. By Millbrook's estimates, buyout firms could pay $70 to 
$73 a share and still generate a 22.5 percent internal rate of 
return, the paper said. Brink's shares closed on Friday at 
$60.17 on the New York Stock Exchange.  Potential strategic buyers could include United 
Technologies Corp. ( UTX.N ), General Electric Co. ( GE.N ) and 
Siemens AG ( SIEGn.DE ), Barron's said, citing analysts. Those 
suitors could pay from $70 to $81 for a quickly accretive deal.
