 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Private equity firms Apollo Management 
and Texas Pacific Group TPG.UL appeared set to win a bid for 
Harrah's Entertainment Inc. HET.N with an offer of at least 
$90 per share for the casino company, The Wall Street Journal 
reported on its Web site on Sunday. 

  Details of a deal for the world's largest casino company 
were still being worked out, but the transaction could be 
announced on Monday, according to the paper.  A deal would bring to an end the takeover saga set in 
motion more two months ago, when Las Vegas-based Harrah's said 
Apollo Management and Texas Pacific Group had offered to buy it 
for $81 per share.  Harrah's, which has so far publicly acknowledged only that 
offer, also received an $87-per-share bid from casino operator 
Penn National Gaming Inc. ( PENN.O ), the paper said.  Harrah's board had set a Tuesday deadline for bids and met 
to review the offers, sources have previously told Reuters.  Harrah's stock closed at $79.50, up 39 cents or 0.5 
percent, on Friday on the New York Stock Exchange -- below the 
bid price -- as investors waited to see what the board would 
do.
