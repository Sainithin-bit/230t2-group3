 LONDON  (Reuters) - U.S. hedge fund Polygon and Swiss 
investment bank UBS ( UBSN.VX ) are preparing a takeover offer 
for English Premier league soccer club Newcastle United 
NCU.L, a source familiar with the talks said. 

  Newcastle said on Friday it had not received a takeover 
offer after its shares surged on speculation of a buyout offer. 
Britain's Daily Mail newspaper reported on Friday that the 
deal, including the club's debt, was worth 227 million pounds.  Polygon made an initial approach for Newcastle in June and 
held talks with majority shareholder John Hall, who with his 
son, owns more than 40 percent of the club. Newcastle chairman 
Freddy Shepherd owns 28 percent of the club.  In August, Newcastle confirmed it was also in takeover 
talks with investment firm Belgravia Group. A Belgravia 
spokesman said on Friday the company was still in talks with 
Newcastle.  The interest in the Tyneside club follows a recent spate of 
buyouts of British soccer clubs.  Last month east London Premier League team West Ham United 
agreed a 85 million pound takeover by an Icelandic consortium 
led by Eggert Magnusson and bankrolled by the billionaire 
chairman of Icelandic bank Landsbanki, Bjorgolfur Gudmundsson.  Premier League champions Chelsea, Manchester United, Aston 
Villa, Fulham and Scottish top flight side Hearts are now all 
in the hands of foreign owners.  Alongside personal sporting interests, investors have been 
attracted by the Premier League clubs' highly visible earnings 
underpinned by loyal fan bases, land values and ballooning 
media revenues as a result of the latest round of television 
deals.
