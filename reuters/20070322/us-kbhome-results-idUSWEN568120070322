 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - KB Home ( KBH.N ), the No. 5 U.S. home builder, said on Thursday net profit fell 84 percent and warned that higher foreclosures and tighter lending standards in the broader market could prolong weakness in the sector. 

 "The primary risk we see from changes in subprime lending is the overall market risk of a potential slowdown in housing demand from buyers not being able to qualify under stricter underwriting standards or the possibility of increased excess supplies of unsold homes from a rise in foreclosures," Chief Executive Jeffrey Mezger said in a conference call. For its fiscal first quarter, ended February 28, KB said net profit fell to $27.5 million, or 34 cents per share, from $173.3 million, or $2.01 a year before. The average of dozen analysts' forecasts was 23 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue fell 19 percent to $1.77 billion, primarily because of lower housing revenue, which fell 20 percent. The lower house revenue reflected an 8 percent lower average U.S. selling price -- down 5 percent including its French unit -- and 16 percent fewer closings. Net orders for new homes fell 12 percent to 7,677, with most of the decline occurring in the Southwest and Central regions. Orders on the West Coast, the most profitable U.S. housing market, rose, while the Southeast was flat, the Los Angeles-based company said. "It's less about earnings; the orders were reasonably good," JMP Securities analyst Jim Wilson said. The company's cancellation rate improved sharply in the first quarter of 2007 to a more normalized 31 percent compared with the prior quarter's 48 percent. The spring selling season, the industry's traditional strongest selling period, so far is proving unstable, Mezger said, and that condition could persist. "Until we get through the selling season, we're not ready to say the market has bottomed and the prices are stabilized," Mezger said. The rise in delinquency and foreclosure rates may increase the supply of homes on the market and generate additional pressure on prices for the next few quarters, he said. In 2005, KB exited the mortgage origination business under an agreement with Countrywide Financial Corp.CFC.N, which today accounts for about 70 percent of all the loans originated for KB. About 13 percent of the mortgages for KB homes in 2006 were financed with a subprime loans. On Thursday, Countrywide Executive Managing Director Sandor Samuels told a government panel that the default rate on subprime mortgages it originated in 2006 could surpass the 2000 record rate of 9.89 percent. Shares of KB fell less than 1 percent as did the Dow Jones U.S. Home Construction Index .DJUSHB, a yardstick that measures home builder performance.
