 SEOUL  (Reuters) - Shares in some Asian mobile phone contract makers and parts suppliers fell on Thursday after Motorola Inc. MOT.N warned of a quarterly loss and said its 2007 outlook was "substantially" worse than expected. 

 Foxconn International Holdings Ltd. ( 2038.HK ) of Hong Kong, which makes Motorola phones, South Korean parts maker Mogem Co. Ltd. 079560.KQ and Singapore's contract electronics maker Jurong Technologies Industrial Corp. JTIL.SI were among the losers. But rival mobile phone makers such as Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd. ( 005930.KS ) and LG Electronics Inc. ( 066570.KS ) rose as they were expected to benefit from Motorola's underperformance. "Motorola contributes 45 percent of Foxconn's total revenue. Given the big exposure to the top phone company, it'd be a big drag," said Charles Guo, a JP Morgan analyst. "Revenue will be hurt and margins could come under pressure." Foxconn, the mobile phone arm of Taiwan's Hon Hai ( 2317.TW ), fell 1.27 percent to HK$23.35 by 0455 GMT, compared with the Hang Seng Index's  .HSI  1.22 percent gain. Motorola has struggled with sharply sliding phone prices as it tried to hold on to its market share despite stiff competition in emerging markets and from industry leader Nokia  ( NOK1V.HE ). Samsung and LG, which previously focused on premium phones, pose a stronger threat for Motorola this year as they are selling more medium- and low-end phones. Last month, LG won a global contest to produce low-cost handsets for third-generation networks. South Korea's Mogem dropped 3.36 percent to 12,950 won, compared with a 0.48 percent gain in the Kosdaq market .KQ11. The company provides casings and decorations for Motorola phones, with sales to Motorola accounting for about 80 percent of its revenue. Jurong Technologies, which supplies battery packs and printed circuit board assembly for its main client Motorola, dropped 4.02 percent to S$0.835, against a 2.02 percent gain in the Straits Times Index .STI. Taiwanese casing maker Chi Cheng ( 3095.TWO ) dipped 2.87 percent to T$101.50, compared with a 0.99 percent rise in the TAIEX shares index  .TWII . Compal Communications Inc. ( 8078.TW ), a unit of Compal Electronics Inc. ( 2324.TW ), shed 1 percent to T$99.50. Compal Communications makes Motorola's low-end, low-margin phones. "Firms in the supply chain are affected by the news," said Grand Cathay Securities' Kevin Yeh. "Handset related shares have been correcting since the last fourth quarter on worries of profit warnings." Companies in Japan and China showed little movement on the Motorola news. However, Samsung Electronics, the world's third-biggest mobile phone maker, and fifth-ranked LG Electronics Inc., rose 1.04 percent and 1 percent respectively, outperforming KOSPI's  .KS11  0.47 percent gain. "Samsung seems to be doing very well this quarter with very strong sales, especially in the mid-to-low end segments," said An Sung-ho, analyst at Hannuri Securities. "In fact, Samsung's strong performance in those segments may have contributed to Motorola's gloomy outlook." (Additional reporting by Vinicy Chan, Marie-France Han,  Sheena Lee  and Jennifer Tan)
