 Corrects General Mills year-earlier net income figure in 14th paragraph 

 By  Brad Dorfman CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Packaged food companies General Mills Inc. ( GIS.N ) and ConAgra Foods Inc. ( CAG.N ) both posted better-than-expected earnings on Thursday, benefiting from manufacturing cost cuts, while stepped-up marketing helped boost sales. General Mills, the world's No. 2 breakfast cereal maker, also raised its full-year forecast, while ConAgra said its earnings for the fiscal year would be at the top of its forecast range -- even including costs for a peanut butter recall. Like most food companies, ConAgra and General Mills have closed manufacturing plants and taken other measures to cut costs in response to rising prices for commodities like corn, while also trying to free up spending to develop new products and increase marketing. But ConAgra, which makes Orville Redenbacher's popcorn, Healthy Choice meals and Hebrew National hot dogs, is still earlier in the game when it comes to trying to improve its business than General Mills. ConAgra is only a year into a strategy designed to simplify its portfolio, cut costs and focus its resources on developing brands like Orville Redenbacher's and Hebrew National. "There's just a lot of low-hanging fruit they are picking up," Gregg Warren, analyst at Morningstar, said of ConAgra's efforts to improve profitability. ConAgra posted profit of $192.6 million, or 38 cents a share, for the fiscal third quarter ended February 25, compared with a loss of $25.2 million, or 5 cents a share, a year earlier. The year-earlier loss includes a $122.9 million loss from discontinued operations. Excluding costs from the peanut butter recall, earnings were 44 cents a share. On that basis, analysts had forecast 35 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. U.S. health regulators said bacteria linked to contaminated peanut butter that has sickened hundreds of people had been traced to ConAgra's plant in Sylvester, Georgia. The company's lone peanut butter plant, where it made its own Peter Pan peanut butter, as well as Great Value for Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ( WMT.N ) has been shut down since mid-February. The company said it does not expect any peanut butter sales or profits in the current fiscal fourth quarter, but it is working to get Peter Pan back on store shelves. "Peter Pan has many loyal consumers and trade customers who want it back," Gary Rodkin, ConAgra chief executive, said in a conference call with analysts. ConAgra sales for the third quarter rose 2 percent to $2.92 billion, the company said. General Mills posted a 6 percent increase in sales to $3.05 billion. The maker of Cheerios cereal, Yoplait yogurt and Progresso soup said net income was $268 million, or 74 cents per share, for its fiscal third quarter ended February 25, compared with $246 million, or 68 cents per share, a year earlier. Analysts on average had forecast 70 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. "We're generating a combination of good unit volume gains, favorable mix (of products sold) and supply chain productivity, which is helping to offset input cost inflation," Steve Sanger, chairman and chief executive, said in a news release. General Mills shares were up 37 cents at $58.25 on Thursday afternoon on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock trades at about 16.8 times estimated 2007 earnings, compared with a multiple of 17.2 for No. 1 cereal company Kellogg Co. ( K.N ). ConAgra shares were off 5 cents at $24.84. The stock trades at about 16.8 times estimated earnings for fiscal 2008.
