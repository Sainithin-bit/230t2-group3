 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - President George W. Bush will meet next week with the chief executives from Detroit's largest automakers, the White House said on Wednesday. 

 The March 26 meeting with officials of General Motors, Ford Motor Co. and DaimlerChrysler AG will focus on alternative fuels, said White House spokesman Tony Fratto. Bush toured General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co. plants in the Kansas City area on Tuesday in visits also aimed at pitching his energy agenda, which includes promoting cars that use less or no gasoline as a way to cut oil use and tailpipe emissions. Bush has set a goal of reducing U.S. gasoline consumption by 20 percent over the next 10 years. Michigan politicians and the auto workers were miffed last year when Bush twice postponed planned meetings in Washington with the executives of the carmakers, which are grappling with billions in financial losses and have been shedding jobs. He ultimately did meet with them at the White House in November, after the congressional elections.
