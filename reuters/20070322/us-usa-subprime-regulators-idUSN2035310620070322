 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. financial regulators have been criticized for doing too little to stem the growth of the subprime and nontraditional mortgages that have experienced rising defaults as the housing market has cooled. 

 Following are some of the actions federal financial regulators have taken in recent years to address risks posed by so-called exotic mortgages and the rise of lending to borrowers with impaired credit histories: March 2, 2007 -- The federal financial regulatory agencies -- the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Office of Thrift Supervision and the National Credit Union Administration -- release for public comment guidance on subprime lending saying that banks need to be clear about a borrower's ability to repay and about risks associated with different mortgage products. December 26, 2006 -- The Fed and the OTS release an updated booklet that lenders are required to give borrowers about adjustable rate mortgages. The booklets were updated to include discussion of interest-only and payment option mortgages, two types of nontraditional mortgages that have become increasingly popular in recent years. The information is known as the Consumer Handbook on Adjustable Rate Mortgages -- the CHARM booklet. The publication dates to 1987. The Fed said banks could use their existing stock of CHARM booklets until October 1, 2007. September 29, 2006 -- The regulators issue final guidance on ways banks should address risks from nontraditional mortgages. These are defined as loans that allow borrowers to exchange lower payments during an initial period for higher payments later on. "The agencies are concerned that some borrowers may not fully understand the risks of these products." June-July, 2006 -- The Fed holds four public hearings around the country on predatory lending and the impact of anti-predatory lending rules on the subprime market, nontraditional mortgages and how consumers select products in the subprime market. February 17, 2006 -- The regulators extend comment period on nontraditional mortgage guidance for 30 days to March 29 in response to requests from financial institutions. December 20, 2005 -- The regulators issue for comment proposed guidance on nontraditional mortgage products. "While innovations in mortgage lending can benefit some consumers, the agencies are concerned that these practices can present unique risks that institutions must appropriately manage. They are also concerned that these products and practices are being offered to a wider spectrum of borrowers, including subprime borrowers and others who may not otherwise qualify for more traditional mortgage loans or who may not fully understand the associated risks of nontraditional mortgages." May 16, 2005 - The regulators issued guidance on home equity lending. "In some cases credit risk management practices for home equity lending have not kept pace with the product's rapid growth and eased underwriting standards." May 27, 2004 - The Fed announces Citigroup has agreed to pay as much as $70 million to settle allegations a subsidiary, CitiFinancial Credit Co., had violated fair lending laws, including charges that it made high cost loans without taking into account borrowers ability to repay. March 11, 2004 - The Fed and the FDIC issue guidance on unfair or deceptive practices by state-chartered banks.
