 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The U.S. Office of Thrift Supervision said on Thursday its 17 thrifts with significant subprime lending operations are "generally well capitalized" and "well positioned" to absorb increases in losses due to foreclosures. 

 The OTS deputy director said in prepared testimony for a Senate Banking Committee hearing on the crisis in the mortgage sector for borrowers with poor credit history that those 17 thrifts had $47 billion in such mortgages as of June 2006. Scott Polakoff told senators the agency is closely monitoring thrifts with significant subprime lending operations. For more about the subprime mortgage crisis, see.
