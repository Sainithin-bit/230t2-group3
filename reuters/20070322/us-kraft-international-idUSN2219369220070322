 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Kraft Foods Inc. KFT.N, signaling Chief Executive Irene Rosenfeld's determination to make foreign acquisitions, is giving its international managers more power to engineer deals, according to a report in The Wall Street Journal. 

 Rosenfeld has made it clear to acquisition teams in the company's overseas offices that they should be identifying targets on their own, people familiar with the matter were reported as saying. Rosenfeld is most interested in Russia, Ukraine, Brazil and Mexico, according to a person familiar with the matter, the Journal said. These local teams also have more flexibility to target acquisitions in new product categories within Kraft's core business and to pursue alternatives such as joint ventures and licensing deals, the Journal said. A representative from Kraft was not immediately available for comment.
