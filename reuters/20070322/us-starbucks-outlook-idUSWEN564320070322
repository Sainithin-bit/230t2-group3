 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Starbucks Corp. ( SBUX.O ) said on Wednesday it still expects to earn between 87 cents and 89 cents per share this year. 

 The coffee shop chain also said it still expects sales at stores open at least 13 months, a key retail measure known as same-store sales, to increase between 3 percent and 7 percent. That forecast is also unchanged. Total revenue growth is expected to be about 20 percent, Starbucks said.
