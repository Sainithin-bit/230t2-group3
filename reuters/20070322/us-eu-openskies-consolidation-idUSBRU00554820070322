 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - A deal between the European Union and the United States to liberalize transatlantic air travel is likely to lead to consolidation among European carriers, EU Transport Commissioner Jacques Barrot said. 

 "I would say yes, I think it could lead to consolidation, that's really quite a plausible outcome," Barrot told a news briefing on Thursday after EU transport ministers unanimously backed the "open skies" agreement.
