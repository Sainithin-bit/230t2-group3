 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Palm Inc. PALM.O said on Thursday that a U.S. court judge granted a stay in a patent infringement lawsuit brought against it by NTP. 

 The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia in Richmond also granted Palm's motion to strike the portion of NTP's complaint alleging misbehavior at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, Palm said. Palm shares fell $1.62, or 8.33 percent, to $17.83 on the New York Stock Exchange. Shares had fallen earlier in the day as an anticipated buyout of the Treo phone maker failed to materialize.
