 MADRID  (Reuters) - Lufthansa ( LHAG.DE ) and a U.S fund have asked to look at Iberia's IBLA.MC books as a first step toward a possible deal with the Spanish airline, newspaper El Pais reported on Thursday, quoting sector sources. 

 El Pais said it was not clear what sort of deal either was looking for with Iberia. Lufthansa and Iberia declined to comment on the report. On Wednesday, Lufthansa reiterated it was not planning to buy a stake or to bid for Iberia. A combined Lufthansa-Iberia would create an airline valued at around 12.8 billion euros, and rivaling Air France-KLM in terms of passengers, carrying around 70 million a year. The Spanish airline said it had given Chairman Fernando Conte permission to hand information about the company to any potential bidder but that it had received no offer yet. Iberia has been the center of takeover attention in the last few days as investors bet that a new "open skies" agreement between the European Union and United States would trigger a new wave of consolidation. Iberia, whose stock has risen 18 percent this week, is due to hold a regular board meeting later on Thursday. "Lufthansa could be a clear candidate. There is very little overlap on routes, seeing as the German group has little exposure to Latin America," brokers at Banesto said in a note, valuing Iberia at 3.20 euros a share. "We believe (a deal) is doable, but we don't expect it to be imminent." Iberia shares out-shone other European airline stocks, rising 1.6 percent to 3.76 euros by 1005 GMT. Sector investors were eagerly waiting to hear whether EU transport ministers back the draft "open skies" proposal in a meeting that kicked off in Brussels at 0900 GMT. Spanish newspaper La Gaceta quoted market sources as saying both Lufthansa and British Airways BAY.L, which holds 10 percent of Iberia, were studying the possibility of launching a bid at 3.90 euros a share, which would value Iberia at 3.7 billion euros ($4.92 billion).
