 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Contrary to what the Federal Communications Commission has said, FCC rules do not bar Sirius Satellite Radio Inc. ( SIRI.O ) from buying rival XM Satellite Radio Holdings Inc. XMSR.O, the companies said on Wednesday. 

 "The commission's published rules do not prohibit one satellite radio licensee from acquiring control of the other," Sirius and XM said in joint proxy filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. "Nowhere does that rule prohibit the ability of a satellite radio licensee to transfer or assign its license in any way," the companies said. "Indeed, the commission's 1997 reference to this rule expressly recognizes that the agency's rules contemplate and permit the filing of this application for the transfer of control of both satellite radio licensees to common ownership." The joint statement is in sharp contrast to what FCC Chairman Kevin Martin said when the deal was first announced in mid-February. Martin, a Republican, said the deal faced a high hurdle because the commission prohibited one company from holding the only two existing satellite radio licenses. Martin on Wednesday declined to comment directly on the Sirius-XM deal, and said he has not yet seen the Sirius-XM merger application, filed with the commission on Tuesday. Sirius aims to buy XM in an all-stock deal worth $4.16 billion, based on Tuesday's closing price for Sirius of $3.37 per share on Nasdaq and XM's 268.5 million outstanding shares. The merger has been criticized by some U.S. lawmakers and consumer groups as anti-competitive. Sirius and XM must win approval from the Justice Department's antitrust division, as well as from the FCC, for their deal to be consummated. According to the FCC, even after the granting of digital audio radio satellite licenses, a licensee would not be allowed to buy control of the other remaining satellite license. A prohibition on transfer of control would help assure sufficient competition in satellite digital radio service provision, according to the FCC regulation written in 1997 when the two satellite radio licenses were issued. A LA CARTE SATELLITE Despite the different interpretations, it appears Martin and the Sirius CEO may see eye to eye on "a la carte programming" -- at least in theory. In trying to persuade lawmakers that a combined Sirius-XM would benefit consumers, Sirius Chief Executive Mel Karmazin told a congressional panel on Tuesday that satellite radio subscribers would be able to block adult channels and get a refund for those channels. "What we have said in our application (with regulators) is that anybody who chooses not to receive any content -- any adult content -- not only has the ability to block it, but there will be a cost reduction to their bill in a more a la carte way," he said. That is similar to an idea Martin has floated in the past -- cable television providers offering consumers the ability to pay only for the channels they want, also known as a la carte. That has been staunchly rejected by the cable industry. "One of the options I have encouraged is allowing parents to take advantage of technologies that allow them to block programming and then also the companies reimburse the price that they are charging consumers for the content that the consumers have said they don't want," Martin told reporters on Wednesday, following a meeting of a new task force on media advertising and childhood obesity.
