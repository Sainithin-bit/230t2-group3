 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - An investigation into possible options 
backdating at Affiliated Computer Services Inc. ( ACS.N ) 
unearthed a handwritten note in which ACS Chairman Darwin 
Deason discussed the practice of always picking the lowest 
prices "so far" in the quarter to award stock options, The Wall 
Street Journal reported. 

  The note raises questions about the company's prior 
assertions that Deason, its founder, knew nothing about 
widespread options backdating at the technology company, the 
Journal said.  News of the note's contents comes at a sensitive time for 
Deason, who earlier this week joined with Cerberus Capital 
Management of New York in a $5.9 billion offer to take ACS 
private.  Representatives of ACS were not immediately available to 
comment to Reuters about the newspaper article.  The Journal quoted Marc Rosenberg of Cravath, Swaine & 
Moore LLP, an attorney for Deason, as saying his client had 
never backdated a stock option and didn't think anyone else was 
backdating options at ACS.  "To the contrary, his notes make it explicit that Deason 
thought ACS's option practices were perfectly legal," Rosenberg 
was quoted as saying.  "The statement in his notes that ACS granted options at the 
lowest price 'so far' was thoroughly reviewed by the 
independent investigators."  Dallas-based Affiliated Computer Services provides 
information technology outsourcing for human resources, finance 
and accounting, payment services and other business needs.
