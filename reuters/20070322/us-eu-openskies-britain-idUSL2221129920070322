 LONDON  (Reuters) - A transatlantic air travel agreement backed by European Union transport ministers on Thursday is a "good deal" for Britain, a government spokesman said. 

 "I think it's a good deal for the UK. I think British airline passengers will benefit from the increased competition, lower fares and hopefully more convenient services," a spokesman in British Prime Minister Tony Blair's office said. Britain had earlier voiced reservations about the draft agreement.
