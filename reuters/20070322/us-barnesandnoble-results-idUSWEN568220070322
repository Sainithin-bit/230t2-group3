 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Top U.S. book retailer Barnes & Noble Inc. ( BKS.N ) on Thursday posted slightly higher quarterly net income, but forecast a loss for the current period. 

 Earlier this month, the company lowered its earnings outlook for its fiscal year, saying higher-than-expected enrollment in its discount program cut into margins. It also attributed its lower earnings forecast to deep discounts on the forthcoming Harry Potter book and a highly competitive book retailing landscape. Net income rose 3 percent to $127 million, or $1.84 per share, in the fourth quarter ended February 3 from $123 million, or $1.76 per share, a year earlier. The latest results included charges of 3 cents per share. Analysts on average had been expecting profit of $1.88 per per share, according to Reuters Estimates. The New York-based company had earlier said it expected to earn $1.86 to $1.96 per share. Revenue increased to $1.88 billion from $1.75 billion, slightly above analysts' estimates of $1.86 billion. Comparable-store sales fell 0.1 percent. For the first quarter, Barnes & Noble expects a loss of 8 to 12 cents per share, including charges from closing its Memphis distribution center and an ongoing investigation of its stock option practices. Analysts were expecting earnings of 1 cent per share. The company said the results and forecast are preliminary and subject to adjustment based on results of an internal probe of stock option practices. Rival Borders Group Inc. BGP.N reported a quarterly loss earlier Thursday and announced a significant strategy shift, including closing nearly half of its Waldenbooks stores and selling books through its own Web site. In early New York Stock Exchange trade, Barnes & Noble shares were down 27 cents, or 0.7 percent, at $38.73, while Borders rose 33 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $21.76.
