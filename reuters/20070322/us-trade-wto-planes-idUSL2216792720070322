 GENEVA  (Reuters) - Boeing ( BA.N ) has benefited from $23.7 billion in illegal state aid, the European Union said on Thursday, hitting back at the United States in a tit-for-tat row at the World Trade Organization (WTO) over plane subsidies. 

 This aid hurt European consortium Airbus EADS.PA and let Boeing undercut its rival in the battle for sales in the big plane market, the EU said in written evidence to the WTO panel probing its complaint against Washington. "The EU's submission exposes in detail the massive, long-standing and WTO-inconsistent subsidization of Boeing's civil aircraft division," the 27-state bloc said in a statement. The world's two largest economies have brought separate cases alleging illegal assistance to their aircraft industries in what is the biggest commercial dispute ever to come before the global trade arbitrator. The United States accuses Europe of granting $100 billion in illegal aid to Airbus over the years of which it will seek the immediate return of some $4.5 billion if it wins. No ruling in the case against Airbus is expected before September, with a verdict in the Boeing case due in early 2008. Around $16.6 billion of the subsidies to Boeing had come through research and development support from the Defense Department and NASA, the space agency, which allowed Boeing to use and out-license its technology without having to pay for it. Boeing had also received $2.2 billion in export subsidies, already condemned in another WTO case, and some $4 billion in tax breaks and other benefits from the states of Washington and Kansas as well as other authorities, the EU said. DWARFED But in a statement, Washington brushed aside Europe's arguments, saying that some of the programs Europe mentioned were not related to civil aircraft while others were available to a range of companies, including Airbus. "They are not subsidies. In any event, even if all of the EC (EU) allegations had merit -- which they don't -- they are dwarfed by the magnitude of the subsidies that Airbus has benefited from," said Boeing spokesman Charlie Miller. The plane row took off in late 2004 when Washington, under pressure from Boeing, withdrew from a 1992 pact between the United States and the EU on commercial airliner financing. At the time Airbus had overtaken Boeing as the world's leading plane maker in terms of its order book, but the U.S. firm has since reclaimed the number one spot. The European consortium has struggled with delivery problems with its giant A380, the world's largest jet, and has embarked on a controversial rescue plan that will cost 10,000 jobs. Both sides have long said that they are ready to negotiate a settlement to legal battles that some industry analysts have said both could end up losing. With China recently announcing plans to enter the large civilian plane market, both are interested in defining aid rules more clearly, whether it be through litigation or negotiation.
