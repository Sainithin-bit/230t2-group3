 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Palm Inc. PALM.O, the current subject of takeover speculation and maker of the Treo smartphone, on Thursday posted a lower quarterly profit as costs rose and it booked charges. 

 The company said net income for its third fiscal quarter fell to $11.8 million, or 11 cents per share, from $29.9 million, or 28 cents per share, a year ago. Revenue rose to $410.5 million from $388.5 million. Shares of Palm fell nearly 9 percent in regular trade on Thursday. An anticipated buyout of the company had yet to materialize and a Wall Street analyst said lower prices could hurt results. Excluding stock-based compensation and an in-process research and development charge and amortization, and other items, the company said it had a profit of $16.5 million, or 16 cents. On that basis, analysts expected a profit of 12 cents per share, on average, on revenue of $403.5 million, according to Reuters Estimates. For the current, fourth quarter, Palm said it expects a profit before items of 13 cents to 16 cents per share on revenue of $400 million to $410 million. Analysts currently expect the Sunnyvale, California-based company to earn a profit 15 cents per share, on average, on revenue of $416.8 million. Mobile phone makers Motorola MOT.N and Nokia ( NOK1V.HE ) and computer makers Dell Inc. DELL.O and Hewlett-Packard Co. ( HPQ.N ) have all been mentioned as companies possibly interested in Palm. Palm made no mention of any takeover or purchase offer for the company in its press release detailing its financial results. In extended trade, Palm shares rose less than 1 percent to $17.85. In regular trade, the stock closed down $1.71 at $17.74.
