  WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The number of Americans filing new 
claims for jobless benefits unexpectedly fell 4,000 last week 
to its lowest in six weeks, government data showed on Thursday 
in a report underscoring a healthy labor market. 

  Initial filings for state unemployment insurance aid fell 
for the third straight week, dropping to 316,000 in the week 
ended March 17 from an upwardly revised 320,000 for the 
previous week, the Labor Department said.  A department analyst said there were no special factors 
behind the decline in new claims, which fell to their lowest 
level since the week ended February 3.  Jobless claims are at a level economists see as consistent 
with stable employment.  Analysts on Wall Street had expected claims, which provide 
a rough guide to the pace of layoffs, to rise to 324,000 from 
the 318,000 initially reported for the March 10 week.  A four-week moving average of claims, which smooths weekly 
volatility to provide a better sense of underlying job-market 
trends, also fell for the second straight week, dropping to 
326,000 from 329,750 in the prior week.  The total number of unemployed still on the benefit rolls 
after drawing an initial week of aid fell 69,000 to 2.50 
million in the week ended March 10, the latest period for which 
figures are available.
