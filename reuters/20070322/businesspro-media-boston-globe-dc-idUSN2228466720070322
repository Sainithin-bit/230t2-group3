 BOSTON  (Reuters) - The Boston Globe's newsroom will shrink 
by 6 percent after 24 journalists, including two Pulitzer Prize 
winners, agreed to voluntary buyouts, New England's 
largest-circulation newspaper said on Wednesday. 

  Citing pressure on circulation and advertising revenue from 
the Internet and other competition, the Globe said the buyouts 
helped it to avoid layoffs "in the face of some of the harshest 
conditions for newspapers and other mass media in years."  The cuts, announced in an article on its Web site, were 
part of a broader buyout program aimed at cutting 125 jobs at 
The New York Times Co.'s New England Media Group, which owns 
The Boston Globe and Worcester Telegram & Gazette.  The Globe, which has won 18 Pulitzer Prizes, announced in 
January it would close its foreign bureaus to cut costs.  Those taking early retirement included veteran columnist 
Eileen McNamara, 54, who won the 1997 Pulitzer Prize for 
commentary, and investigative reporter Stephen Kurkjian, 63, 
who shared in three Pulitzer prizes, the paper said.  "It is always difficult to say goodbye to co-workers and 
friends," Editor Martin Baron wrote in a memo to staff.  "Wonderful people who have dedicated themselves so fully to 
the success of the Globe will no longer be working with us side 
by side. I know that all of us wish them well."  The Globe said the buyout had been intended to cut 19 jobs 
in the newsroom and editorial pages but many more people 
applied. Some were turned down, although Baron declined to say 
how many applied and how many were rejected.
