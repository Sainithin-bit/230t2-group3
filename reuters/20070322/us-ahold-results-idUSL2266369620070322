 AMSTERDAM  (Reuters) - Dutch retailer Ahold NV beat market forecasts on Thursday as it more than doubled fourth-quarter net profit and said it would buy back more shares, suggesting it expects a good price for a U.S. unit. 

 Profit at the world's fourth-biggest food retailer and foodservice group by sales rose to 240 million euros ($319 million) from 108 million a year ago, beating an average forecast of 169 million euros in a Reuters poll of 14 analysts. Ahold ( AHLN.AS ) AHO.N shares were up 1.2 percent at 8.30 euros by 0846 GMT, outperforming a 0.7 percent rise in the DJ Stoxx retail index .SXRP. The stock rose as high as 8.35 euros, its highest since mid December. "We are pleasantly surprised by Ahold's news. The outlook provides reassurance regarding 2007. The 3 billion euro share buyback increases confidence about the (U.S. Foodservice) disposal process," SNS Securities analyst Richard Withagen wrote in a note. Ahold said it planned to increase its share buyback to 3 billion euros from 2 billion, raising hopes it will get a higher-than-expected price for catering supplies unit U.S. Foodservice which it put up for sale last November. Asked whether the higher buyback was linked to optimism about the U.S. Foodservice sale, Chief Financial Officer John Rishton said: "Clearly we have more information than we had." He said the sale process was progressing well but declined to provide more details. Ahold is selling U.S. Foodservice, which sources say has attracted bids from several private equity groups and could fetch more than $6 billion. TARGETS MET Analysts said a sale could lead to a merger between Ahold and its smaller Belgian rival Delhaize DELBt.BR. Ahold declined to comment but said the firm would stay on the look out for interesting acquisition opportunities. Operating income, which included an 84 million euro charge related to the sale and closure of U.S. stores chain Tops, fell to 199 million euros from 293 million a year earlier. "Ahold met the targets we set last year. U.S. Foodservice delivered 1.7 percent operating margin, our retail operations performed in line with our margin guidance and exceeded sales growth guidance," said Chief Executive Anders Moberg. Ahold owns the Netherlands' biggest supermarket chain Albert Heijn but makes just over 70 percent of its sales in the United States. It is revamping its U.S. supermarkets, which account for just over 40 percent of group sales. The U.S. retail market, especially in the northeast where Ahold has most of its stores, is expected to be "a bit more robust" this year than in 2006, Larry Benjamin, chief operating officer for the United States, told a conference call. The company forecast a 2007 operating margin of 4.0 to 4.5 percent for its retail businesses, unchanged from last year. U.S. Foodservice had $81 million in operating income against a $9 million loss a year ago and an operating margin of 1.8 percent. Albert Heijn had a fourth-quarter operating income of 100 million euros, up 31 million. Ahold reiterated its plan to cut its debt by 2 billion euros as part of efforts to regain an investment-grade credit rating. Its shares trade at 16 times forecast 2007 earnings against 20 times for France's Carrefour ( CARR.PA ) and Delhaize's 15 times, according to Reuters Estimates.
