 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - The United States welcomed the backing of European Union transport ministers for an "open skies" aviation agreement on Thursday, saying it was historic and would benefit consumers. 

 "The historic decision by the European Council of Ministers to endorse an Open Skies agreement between the U.S. and the EU will bring new and valuable benefits to air travelers and communities on both sides of the Atlantic," Transportation Secretary Mary Peters said in a statement. She did not react specifically to a decision by EU ministers to push back the start date of the agreement by five months to March 2008.
