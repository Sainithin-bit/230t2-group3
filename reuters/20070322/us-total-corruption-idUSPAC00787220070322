 PARIS  (Reuters) - The chief executive of French oil major Total ( TOTF.PA ) is to be held in police custody for another 24 hours, a judicial source said on Thursday, over a probe into alleged kickbacks in an Iranian gas deal. 

 The source said Christophe de Margerie spent Wednesday night in a cell at the Paris headquarters of the financial police. Total has said it is confident that the investigation will find no wrongdoing. De Margerie was ordered in for questioning on Wednesday along with four others who were released the same evening without charge. Under French law, de Margerie can be held for a total of 48 hours, divided into two 24-hour periods, until Friday before a judge decides whether to put him under formal investigation.
