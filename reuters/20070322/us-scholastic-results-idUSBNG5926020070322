 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Scholastic Corp. ( SCHL.O ), the U.S. publisher of the Harry Potter series, reported a worse-than-expected quarterly loss and cut its full-year forecast on Thursday due to higher debt and promotion-related costs, driving shares down more than 13 percent. 

 The loss narrowed from a year ago as Scholastic's children's book publishing unit swung to a profit. But the company also reported higher bad debt and amortization of costs for promoting direct-to-home sales. Shares fell to as low as $30.24, their biggest drop in more than four years. Scholastic also was the top percentage loser on the Nasdaq stock market on Thursday. Scholastic plans to make the direct-sales operation, known as the continuities business, profitable, or "explore other options," Chief Executive Richard Robinson said on a conference call with financial analysts on Thursday. Scholastic has been trimming promotion costs and expenses as it works to improve its bottom line, Prudential analyst Steven Barlow said. "The turnaround in fairs and clubs is just not as fast as the Street was expecting," Barlow said. "Costs didn't come out fast enough." The company sells books through school fairs, and organizes school book clubs with newsletters and reading level charts. Scholastic cut its earnings forecast for fiscal 2007, which ends in May, to between $1.40 and $1.60 a share, down from $1.55 to $1.85. It forecast full-year revenue of $2.1 billion to $2.2 billion. Analysts were expecting $1.77 a share on revenue of $2.19 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. The New York-based company is gearing up for the July 21 release of "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows," which author J.K. Rowling has said would end the series. Scholastic has said it plans to release a record-breaking 12 million copies for the first U.S. printing of "Deathly Hallows." Harry Potter revenue will come in the company's 2008 fiscal year. For its fiscal third quarter ended February 28, Scholastic reported a loss of $7.7 million, or 18 cents a share, compared with a loss of $15.5 million, or 37 cents a share, last year. The results included a gain of 4 cents a share on the sale of an investment. Analysts were expecting a loss of 8 cents a share, before special items, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue rose to $497 million from $487.7 million. Wall Street was looking for revenue of $499.7 million. Revenue at the children's book publishing unit rose 3 percent. Operating income was $4.4 million compared with a loss of $3.2 million a year earlier. Scholastic's international operating profit rose, while educational publishing reported a smaller loss. Media, licensing and advertising profit fell. Shares fell $4.75, or 13.36 percent, to $30.81 on the Nasdaq stock market. (Additional reporting by John Tilak in Bangalore)
