 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Borders Group Inc. BGP.N on Thursday 
plans to announce its intention to reopen its own branded 
e-commerce Web site in early 2008, ending an alliance with 
Amazon.com Inc. ( AMZN.O ) that had been the core of its online 
strategy, The Wall Street Journal reported. 

  At the same time, it will announce it is giving up on a 
decade-long effort to expand its own book-superstore concept 
internationally and will sell or franchise most of its 73 
overseas Borders stores, the Journal said.  The company also plans to close nearly half of the 
Waldenbooks outlets it owns throughout the United States, the 
Journal reported.  Additionally, Borders plans to build a much bigger 
proprietary publishing operation by striking deals with 
Hollywood writers, celebrities and best-selling authors, the 
Journal said.  A representative from the book seller were not immediately 
available for comment.
