 SEOUL  (Reuters) - Shares in some Asian mobile phone contract makers and parts suppliers fell on Thursday after Motorola Inc. MOT.N warned of a quarterly loss and said its 2007 outlook was "substantially" worse than expected. 

 Foxconn International Holdings Ltd. ( 2038.HK ) of Hong Kong, which makes Motorola phones, South Korean parts maker Mogem Co. Ltd. 079560.KQ and Singapore's contract electronics maker Jurong Technologies Industrial Corp. JTIL.SI were among the losers. But rival mobile phone makers such as Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd. ( 005930.KS ) and LG Electronics Inc. ( 066570.KS ) rose as they were expected to benefit from Motorola's underperformance. "Motorola contributes 45 percent of Foxconn's total revenue. Given the big exposure to the top phone company, it'd be a big drag. Revenue will be hurt and margins could come under pressure," said Charles Guo, a JP Morgan analyst. Motorola has struggled with sharply sliding phone prices as it tried to hold on to its market share despite stiff competition in emerging markets and from industry leader Nokia ( NOK1V.HE ). Foxconn, the mobile phone arm of Taiwan's Hon Hai ( 2317.TW ), dropped 2.54 percent to HK$23.05 by 0252 GMT, compared with Hang Seng Index's  .HSI  1.21 percent gain. South Korea's Mogem fell 2.24 percent to 13,050 won, compared with a 0.61 percent gain in the Kosdaq market .KQ11. The company provides casings and decorations for Motorola phones. In Singapore, Jurong Technologies, which makes battery packs and PCB assembly for Motorola, lost 1.72 percent to S$0.86, against a 2.06 percent gain in the Straits Times Index .STI. Meanwhile, Samsung Electronics, the world's third-biggest mobile phone maker, and fifth-ranked LG Electronics Inc., rose 0.86 percent and 0.67 percent respectively. Their gains were in line with other South Korean exporters whose shares rose on hopes the Federal Reserve would cut U.S. interest rates, boosting exports to the U.S. market.
