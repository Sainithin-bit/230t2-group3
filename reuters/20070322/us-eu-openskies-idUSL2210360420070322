 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - European Union transport ministers unanimously backed a landmark agreement with the United States on Thursday that will throw open transatlantic air travel to more competition and drive down fares. 

 But the 27 ministers, at Britain's request, decided on a five-month delay in implementing the deal so it will take effect on March 30, 2008 instead of October this year. German Transport Minister Wolfgang Tiefensee, who chaired the talks, hailed a "breakthrough" that would give a boost to transatlantic relations and benefit consumers and airlines. The "open skies" agreement will allow EU airlines to fly from any city in the 27-nation bloc to any city in the United States and vice versa, replacing highly restrictive bilateral arrangements dating back to World War Two. EU Transport Commissioner Jacques Barrot forecast the deal would boost transatlantic flights by 50 percent over five years and he expected it to trigger takeovers among European airlines. European member states would be able to withdraw benefits of the agreement from U.S. airlines if Washington did not agree by 2010 to allow foreign airlines to buy control of U.S. carriers, he said. "The deal is of great political and economic importance," Barrot told a news conference. "I am delighted to have piloted this agreement to its destination with all passengers still on board." The United States welcomed the EU decision, saying it was historic and would benefit consumers. Britain had sought concessions for London's Heathrow airport, Europe's busiest hub, and some firm assurance that Washington will in future allow foreign airlines to own and control U.S. carriers, but appeared to have won little extra. A spokesman for British Prime Minister Tony Blair described the Brussels deal as "a good deal for the UK". SHARES TAKE OFF British Transport Secretary Douglas Alexander said it would be up to each individual state to decide which rights they will take away if Washington did not allow foreign investment in and ownership of U.S. airlines in a second-phase agreement. Proponents say "open skies" would boost competition, increase flight frequencies, reduce fares and create jobs on both sides of the Atlantic. But Britain was reluctant to lift restrictions at Heathrow, which favor British Airways and Virgin Atlantic>, without getting more rights to invest in U.S. carriers. European airline shares rose on the news, including British Airways despite worries that the pact would expose it to greater competition and hurt its profits from lucrative transatlantic business passengers. Speculation that "open skies" would trigger airline mergers boosted Spain's Iberia on Wednesday. Deutsche Lufthansa denied it was interested in the carrier. Apart from BA, European and U.S. airlines are largely supportive. "This is good news for passengers," said Ulrich Schulte-Strathaus, head of the Association of European Airlines. "It is also good news for communities in Europe as airlines seek to serve new regions at attractive prices." Currently British Airways, Virgin Atlantic, AMR Corp.'s American Airlines and UAL Corp.'s United Airlines are the only carriers allowed to fly transatlantic routes through Heathrow. The new rules would abolish those restrictions but would not create extra takeoff and landing slots at the busy hub. U.S. rules limit foreign investment in U.S. carriers to 25 percent of voting rights, whereas U.S. companies can control up to 49 percent of EU carriers -- a key sticking point for Europe. The new deal would give European companies the right to own more than 50 percent of non-voting equity in U.S. carriers and allow the EU to limit U.S. investment in EU airlines to 25 percent of voting shares.
