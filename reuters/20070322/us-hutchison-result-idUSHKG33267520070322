 HONG KONG  (Reuters) - Hutchison Whampoa Ltd. ( 0013.HK ), tycoon Li Ka-shing's ports-to-telecoms flagship, posted a 40 percent surge in 2006 net profit on Thursday, in line with forecasts, on narrowing losses at its third-generation mobile telecoms business and exceptional gains. 

 The company, which is the world's largest container ports operator and has extensive holdings in retail, energy and property, posted net income for 2006 of HK$20.03 billion (US$2.57 billion), compared with a HK$14.34 billion net profit in 2005. The result compares with an average forecast net profit of HK$20.33 billion from 11 analysts polled by Reuters Estimates, although investors have for the last several years been mostly preoccupied with the company's $25 billion investment in 3G telecoms in Italy, Britain and a handful of other countries.

Revenue for the 3 Group rose 35 percent to HK$50.7 billion. "The bottom line looks pretty much in line and 3G losses are slightly better," said Cusson Leung, analyst at Credit Suisse. Revenue per 3G user on a trailing 12-month average active customer basis rose by 8 percent to 45.63 euros (US$61.08) per month, while its average user acquisition cost fell to 250 euros, from 293 euros in 2005. Its 3 subscriber base rose to more than 14.7 million currently, from 13.5 million in late August. ASSET SALES Hutchison has in recent years been selling off assets in order to offset 3G losses. As usual, its 2006 results were driven by exceptional gains of HK$27.1 billion, including HK$24.4 billion for the sale of a 20 percent stake in its ports unit to Singapore's PSA International PSA.UL. Hutchison said its share of the profit on the sale this year of India's No.4 cellular carrier by subsidiary Hutchison Telecommunications International Ltd. 2332.HK to British giant Vodafone ( VOD.L ) is about US$4.68 billion, as well as a cash dividend of US$2.05 billion. It will also reap special dividends from its 35 percent stake in Canadian oil producer Husky Energy Inc. ( HSE.TO ). Earnings before interest and taxes at the company's ports business rose by 12 percent, but retail earnings fell 17 percent following two big acquisitions in 2005. While asset sales smooth losses incurred on the company's contrarian 3G bet, selling off profitable holdings threatens to erode growth going forward. Future one-time gains could come from selling its stake in Husky -- the subject of perennial speculation -- or the revival of an initial public offering of Hutchison's Italian 3G business. Hutchison scrapped a spin-off of 3 Italia, its largest 3G unit, early last year after failing to attract its hoped-for valuation. Sister property developer Cheung Kong (Holdings) ( 0001.HK ), which owns nearly half of Hutchison, posted a 29 percent jump in 2006 earnings, in line with forecasts. Hutchison shares, weighed down for more than six years by its push into multimedia-enabled wireless telecoms in Europe, skidded after the company pushed back 3G break-even targets during its August interim briefing. The stock was up by 0.66 percent at HK$75.95 on Thursday morning before the results release. Hutchison said in August that it expected positive monthly 3G earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) after deducting user acquisition costs on a sustainable basis in the first half of 2007 -- a target that investors hope the company can achieve. After a rally in anticipation of the $11.1 billion sale of the Indian cellular carrier, Hutchison shares have fallen and are flat for the past year.
