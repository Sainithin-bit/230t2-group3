 NEW YORK/WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Blackstone Group LP, an investment firm known for taking huge public companies into private ownership, filed on Thursday to bring part of the firm public in an offering worth up to $4 billion. 

 Raising funds through a public offering allows Blackstone quick and steady access to money they would otherwise have to raise privately. The firm said it also allows flexibility in pursuing future deals and permits a range of financial and retention incentives for its employees. In addition, the filing allows public access to what had previously been private numbers, including the $2.27 billion of net income it earned last year, its $1.12 billion of revenue and net gains from investment activities of $7.6 billion. A $4 billion public float from would rank Blackstone's offering among the top 10 largest IPOs ever raised by a U.S. company, according to Dealogic. In 1985 Blackstone opened its first office with a staff of four, including founders Peter Peterson and Stephen Schwarzman, and $400,000. Peterson had been CEO of Lehman Brothers, and Schwarzman head of Lehman's M&A group. News of the offering from Blackstone, whose recent deals include the $23 billion purchase of Equity Office Properties Trust and the $17.6 billion buyout of Freescale Semiconductor, surfaced late last week. Private equity firms such as Apollo Management and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. have launched publicly traded funds, but these funds are affiliates. Blackstone is among the few U.S. private investment funds to ever take itself public, following in the wake of the IPO of Fortress Investment Group LLC ( FIG.N ) last month, which raised $600 million. Blackstone is selling units as a master limited partnership, which functions differently from most publicly traded companies. Blackstone did not reveal how many units it plans to sell, or their estimated price, as those details are expected in future filings. It plans to list on the New York Stock Exchange, but did not propose a stock symbol. "This is totally different from, say, Google IPO-ing and selling large portions of its stock to the public. This is a very limited foray into the public market and I don't see it getting much traction beyond that. They are not going to give up control. They like the privacy," said Anthony Sabino, attorney for Sabino & Sabino, a professor of law and business at St. John's University. Blackstone is best known for its private equity investing, in which it buys companies by borrowing most of the money, restructures the businesses and sells them later. Private equity firms are not obliged to make most public disclosures, including earnings and compensation, but Blackstone's IPO filing has offered a glimpse at the firm's earnings. THE FINANCIALS The firm said its net income increased about 70 percent in 2006 to $2.27 billion from the previous year. Its 2006 revenues include $852.3 million in fund management fees, and $256.9 million in advisory fees. Including interest and other fees, the total revenue figure is $1.12 billion, more than double the previous year. Net gains from investment activities are $7.6 billion, up from $5.14 billion in the prior year. The fund has $78.7 billion assets under management as of March 1. Last year, Blackstone said its private equity business generated income before taxes of $1 billion, while its real estate group generated income before taxes of $902.7 million. CEO Schwarzman will receive no compensation other than a $350,000 salary and will own a significant portion of the carried interest earned from its funds, the filing said. The filing also offers a look into the corporate jet, helicopter and other perks offered to Schwarzman, Peterson and President Hamilton James. The prospectus gives "historical internal rates of returns for their funds and for private equity and real estate, the returns are close to mind-boggling," said Jay Ritter, a professor of finance at the University of Florida. "But as they get bigger, and more money goes into private equity, it's unrealistic to think that investors will get returns this high in the future." The New York-based firm said Morgan Stanley and Citigroup were the lead underwriters for the IPO. (Additional reporting by Yung Kim and  Jonathan Keehner )
