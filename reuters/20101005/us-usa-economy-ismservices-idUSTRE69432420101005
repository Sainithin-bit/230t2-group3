 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The pace of growth in the U.S. non-manufacturing sector accelerated last month more quickly than economists had expected and hiring also picked up, according to an industry report released on Tuesday. 

 KEY POINTS: * The Institute for Supply Management said its services index rose to 53.2 in September from 51.5 in August. That was above the 52.0 median forecast of 74 economists surveyed by Reuters. * A reading above 50 indicates expansion. The sector, which comprises mostly service sector firms, accounts for two-thirds or more of U.S. economic activity. COMMENTS: JIM AWAD, MANAGING DIRECTOR, ZEPHYR MANAGEMENT, NEW YORK: "It grew more than expected, and that's why the market is rallying. That will add to the insurance policy that the double-dip risk is receding, and combined with the massive liquidity being provided by central banks around the world, that should give us a further short-term boost in stock prices, until earnings season begins... which will be the reality check." VASSILI SEREBRIAKOV, CURRENCY STRATEGIST, WELLS FARGO BANK, NEW YORK: "The numbers are obviously better than expected. In terms of data we are in a sweet spot where indicators no longer point to a double-dip recession. Instead, they are consistent to a slow recovery. But as far as the dollar is concerned, the recent numbers are not strong enough to detract the Fed from pumping more stimulus to the economy. The message for the currency markets is that the dollar will remain vulnerable for the time being, even though we are getting close to the point were further strength in currencies such as the euro is unjustified." CARY LEAHEY, ECONOMIST, DECISION ECONOMICS, NEW YORK: "The report takes the index about half-way back to where it was two months ago. Any expansion is welcome given how sluggishly the economy is performing. The market looks at the orders number which rose as a sign of strength in the service sector. What's interesting is that up until a couple of years ago the service sector ran above the manufacturing sector. Now the manufacturing sector is doing better than the service sector because they recovered after the recession and they are generating good exports. The service sector does not benefit as much from improved U.S. exports. These indexes are running at levels consistent with GDP growth of about 2 percent. The market's expectation going into every month for the next six months is that these indexes will trend lower because they trended lower in the last slow-growth period of 2002-03." MICHELLE MEYER, SENIOR ECONOMIST, BOFA MERRILL LYNCH GLOBAL RESEARCH, NEW YORK "It shows there was some pickup in services activity in September from August. It suggests we could see an acceleration in new orders in the coming months. Consumers are still spending but cautiously. There was a decent a back-to-school retail season. This is a recovery that we are muddling through, but we are not seeing any signs of an outright contraction."
