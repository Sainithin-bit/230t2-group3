 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. options trading volume is expected to pick up next year but growth will be slower than previous years as retail investors return to the market, an NYSE Euronext executive said on Tuesday. 

 Options trading last month fell 4 percent from a year ago, reflecting a recent trend of capital moving out of risky assets amid a low volatility environment. But now might be a better time for retail investors to dip their toes into the market. "From where the market stands today, there are great opportunities," said Ed Boyle, vice president of NYSE Arca Options, the electronic trading venue owned by exchange operator NYSE Euronext. NYX.N. NYSE Euronext also owns the Amex options platform. Small investors have helped fuel one of the longest stretches of gains for stocks in history, but a "flash crash" in May that sent major indexes spiraling in an unprecedented breakdown heightened fears about the market, prompting some investors to keep their cash on the sidelines. Trading volumes and volatility fell this summer. Boyle said current conditions may encourage investors to return. "The low volume actually offers more opportunities for retail investors to trade because the market is being so heavily watched," he told Reuters at an industry conference in New York. Average daily U.S. option volume last month totaled 14.4 million, down 4 percent from the same month in 2009, according to the Options Industry Council. "We are expecting the volume to come back next year, but the growth will be slow," Boyle said. He said the NYSE Arca was looking into launching a volatility index similar to CBOE's Volatility Index .VIX, owned by rival CBOE Holdings ( CBOE.O ), to draw investors back into the options arena. The VIX is the most popular gauge used to assess investor anxiety on Wall Street. (Reporting by  Angela Moon , Editing by Leslie Adler)
