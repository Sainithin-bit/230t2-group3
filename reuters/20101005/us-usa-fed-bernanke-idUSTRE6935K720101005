 PROVIDENCE, Rhode Island  (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve's asset purchases lowered borrowing costs and helped the economy, and more buying could further ease financial conditions, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said on Monday. 

 "I don't have a number to give you, but I do think that the additional purchases, although we don't have precise numbers, have the ability to ease financial conditions," Bernanke said. The Fed bought $1.7 trillion of mortgage-related and Treasury bonds after cutting benchmark interest rates to near zero to combat the financial crisis and help the economy pull out of a severe recession. Financial markets expect the Fed to embark upon another round of asset buying to bolster a sluggish recovery as early as its November meeting, but policy-makers remain divided about the effectiveness of further purchases. Earlier on Monday, the head of the New York Fed's markets group, Brian Sack, said arguments that further purchases won't affect the economy were "overstated" and further asset buying would help spur recovery. Bernanke said he was convinced that the Fed's purchases had lowered borrowing costs, which in turn spurred the recovery. The purchase program "increased the willingness of investors to take a reasonable amount of risk and create some support for the economy," he said. "I think it was an effective program." In September, the Fed said it was ready to take further steps if needed to help the U.S. recovery and lift inflation. In a speech later on Monday, Bernanke said the United States faced dire consequences it  failed to put its federal budget on a sustainable path, but belt tightening too soon could harm economic recovery. Bernanke said the deficits had stabilized somewhat as the economy has started to recover. "Economic conditions provide little scope for reducing deficits significantly further over the next year or two; indeed, premature fiscal tightening could put the recovery at risk," Bernanke said in prepared remarks to the Rhode Island Public Expenditure Council. During his earlier speech, Bernanke also defended the U.S. government's often-criticized program to support banks during the global financial crisis. The Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP, has turned out to be a "pretty good investment" for taxpayers as the money loaned to banks is returned with interest, he said. Many people don't understand that the financial bailout fund was designed to help the economy, not the banks, and that the country's economic downturn would have been much worse without it, Bernanke said. The $700 billion program was approved by the U.S. Congress at the height of the financial crisis in October 2008. The program came to an end on Sunday as the Treasury Department's authority to make new investments expired. The Obama administration said last week the ultimate cost of the program to taxpayers was likely to come in below $50 billion.
