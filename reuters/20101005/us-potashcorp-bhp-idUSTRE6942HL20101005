 TORONTO  (Reuters) - Canada's Potash Corp ( POT.TO ) slammed a report commissioned by its home province that favors BHP Billiton's ( BHP.AX )( BLT.L ) $39 billion offer to buy the fertilizer maker over a potential bid from a state-owned Chinese entity. 

 The company, based in Saskatchewan, said the report understates the royalty revenue that the province could lose should the Anglo-Australian miner's hostile bid succeed. The report, prepared by the Conference Board of Canada and released on Monday, cautioned the provincial government against thwarting BHP's takeover bid. It said that would depress Potash Corp's share price and could have a negative impact on new investment in the province. Potash Corp shares rose about 2 percent on Monday on the view that the report made it more likely that BHP would carry the day. On Tuesday the stock slipped nearly 2 percent to C$145.10 in midday trade on the Toronto Stock Exchange. That's still much higher than BHP's $130-a-share offer price, which Potash Corp has rejected as "grossly inadequate." Potash Corp -- the No.1 supplier of an agricultural input that China and other countries need to feed their growing populations -- has encouraged other parties to step forward with alternative bids. So far none have surfaced. China's state-owned chemical giant Sinochem ( 600500.SS ) is viewed as the most likely to emerge with a competing offer -- a prospect that Monday's report cast in a negative light. It said the interests of the province would line up more closely with BHP's than with those of any Chinese-led rival bidder. China, as one of the world's top consumers of the crop nutrient, would prefer to keep potash prices low, a strategy that could hurt Saskatchewan under its current royalty regime. Saskatchewan is reviewing the report and will submit its views to the federal government in early November on whether Ottawa should approve a takeover by BHP. Under law, any takeover must carry a "net benefit" to Canada. "The board of directors of Potash Corp would encourage the government of Saskatchewan to continue to remain open to reviewing alternative bids on a fact-based approach, rather than the speculative approach taken by the Conference Board of Canada's report," Potash Corp said in the filing. Saskatchewan Energy Minister Bill Boyd said on Monday that the province has not ruled out any option -- endorsing or opposing BHP's bid, or suggesting conditions -- as it prepares its recommendations to Ottawa.
