 PARIS  (Reuters) - The lawyer representing Jerome Kerviel said on Tuesday that he would appeal a Paris court's decision to sentence the former Societe Generale trader to five years in prison. 

 The judgment was "senseless" and the sentence was "extraordinary," Olivier Metzner told journalists after the court had heard the ruling. ($1=.7296 Euro) (Reporting by Matthieu Protard; Editing by  James Regan )
