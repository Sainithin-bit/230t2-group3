 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Bank of Japan Governor Masaaki Shirakawa said on Tuesday that the central bank may increase the size of a fund pool set aside for asset buying from 5 trillion yen ($60 billion) if the need arises in the future. 

 The central bank earlier pledged to pump more funds into the struggling economy and keep interest rates at virtually zero, surprising markets and stealing a march on the Federal Reserve in providing a fresh dose of economic stimulus. KEY POINTS: -- The central bank also decided to set up, as a temporary measure, a 5 trillion yen ($60 billion) fund to buy assets ranging from government bonds and short-term government securities to commercial paper and corporate bonds, and will also accept another 30 trillion yen of those assets as collateral under a loan scheme. -- It cut the overnight call rate target to a range of zero to 0.1 percent from the previous 0.10 percent by unanimous vote. -- The decision to cut interest  rates was made by a unanimous vote, but board member Miyako Suda opposed including government bonds among the type of assets the BOJ could buy using its pool of funds. -- It cut its assessment of Japan's economy, saying there is a greater chance of economic growth undershooting a forecast it issued in July. ********************************************************** COMMENTARY: TIM CONDON, CHIEF ECONOMIST AND HEAD OF RESEARCH, ING FINANCIAL MARKETS, SINGAPORE "The initial reaction was positive, but it's not clear how they're going to prevent deflation from intensifying. I think it's clear that they're concerned and they see there's a need for an incremental policy response, but it's not clear this will be enough. "Compare this with the options Bernanke laid out in his Jackson Hole speech. There's quite a bit of difference. Bernanke sees the need to prevent deflation from taking hold. "The BOJ's policy is to keep the CPI at 100. Like most central banks today, they're data driven. If they see that the CPI is stabilized and is not going down, then they'll be content to hold on." SUSUSMU KATO, CHIEF ECONOMIST, CREDIT AGRICOLE "My first impression was that Governor Shirakawa used the phrase 'comprehensive easing' instead of 'quantitative easing', so I think there is still some negative implication of the previous quantitative easing. He liked to differentiate from the previous easing measures. "The tankan survey had shown the outlook to be very bad, so now is the time to do something. There are some bills to reform the Bank of Japan, (led by) Your Party joined by the Komeito Party, and growing political pressure could be the case (for the aggressive move). The BOJ must be more proactive." EARLIER COMMENTS MADE JUST AFTER THE BOJ DECISION: MINORI UCHIDA, SENIOR ANALYST, BANK OF TOKYO-MITSUBISHI UFJ "It's good that the BOJ eased before the Fed took easing steps. It will make it easier for Japan to make a case for intervention." "But it's probably too much to expect today's steps to fully offset the possible impact of the Fed's eventual quantitative easing. Because Japan's monetary policy has been loose for years, any additional move tends to have a limited impact." "The dollar has so far failed to rise to 84 yen. If it cannot rise beyond the level even after today's New York trade, that could strengthen expectations of further declines in the dollar." SEIJI SHIRAISHI, CHIEF ECONOMIST, HSBC SECURITIES JAPAN "It was an utterly surprising and bold move. The BOJ has sent a favorable message to the markets, which had been expecting it to take only small, gradual steps. "Still, the BOJ's move is unlikely to impact the overall economy much even though the yen weakened briefly, as the root of the problems lies in the weakness of the U.S. economy. "The BOJ may be forced to take more steps such as expanding its new fund to boost liquidity in the markets, as Japan's economy will face a more severe situation ahead with the effects of government stimulus waning and global growth slowing." KYOHEI MORITA, CHIEF ECONOMIST, JAPAN, BARCLAYS CAPITAL JAPAN "It's not quantitative easing but they stressed a zero-rate policy, said they would keep this policy until prices stabilize, and decided to push for credit easing by buying CPs, corporate bonds, ETFs and REITs ... "The BOJ did most of what it could do today, and returned the ball back to the government's court. "It did not decide to buy foreign bonds, thus it did not try to directly affect currency rates ... But Governor Shirakawa has said he was watching the yen rise carefully and the yen is now around the level before the government intervened in the currency market. So, although the BOJ steps were not directly aimed at affecting currency rates, the yen rise, along with the BOJ tankan and industrial output figures, was behind their decision today." JOHN VAIL, CHIEF STRATEGIST, NIKKO ASSET MANAGEMENT, TOKYO "I think it will help stabilize or even weaken the yen. The creation of this fund seems like a semi rinban increase and I think the threat of future rinban is implicit. "I think everyone was a bit surprised by this. A lot of people were saying the BOJ never does anything. I think a lot of people expected something but didn't really know what to expect, something a little bit stronger but not too major, and this is on the side of major." KOJI FUKAYA, CHIEF CURRENCY STRATEGIST, CREDIT SUISSE "This went beyond what markets have expected. It seems quite comprehensive in that it is going to buy government bonds as well as credit products such as commercial paper etc. "The BOJ also cut interest rates to 0-0.1 percent, which I take to mean that they intend to flood the market with cash. "This could set off yen-carry trades, as opposed to dollar-carry trades. The BOJ's decision will reduce the risk of dollar/yen falling below 83 yen, although I still expect it will meet heavy offers around 85 yen." MARKET REACTION: -- For yen updates click; for prices click -- For JGB updates, click, for prices click -- For stocks click, for the Nikkei click LINKS: BACKGROUND: -- The BOJ had kept interest rates at 0.1 percent since late 2008. In the wake of sharp gains in the yen it eased monetary policy last December by setting up a facility offering cheap funds to banks, which was expanded in March and in August. -- The BOJ's step in August did little to deter yen gains or falls in share prices as investors saw it as a symbolic gesture that had hardly any effect in supporting the economy. -- Tokyo stepped into the currency market last month for the first time in more than six years to stem a rise in the yen seen as threatening Japan's fragile economic recovery.
