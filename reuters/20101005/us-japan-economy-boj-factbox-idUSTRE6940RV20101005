 TOKYO  (Reuters) - The Bank of Japan on Tuesday decided to set up, as a temporary measure, a 5 trillion yen ($59.9 billion) pool of funds to buy assets ranging from government bonds to corporate bonds. 

 Following are key points about the new measure: -- The programme will consist of a fund totaling 5 trillion yen to buy assets anew as well as the existing 30-trillion-yen fixed-rate fund-supply tool that will hold designated assets as collateral. -- The programme is a temporary measure aimed at encouraging declines in long-term interest rates and risk premiums. -- The fund is designed to cover Japanese government bonds, treasury bills, commercial paper (CP), asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP), corporate bonds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and Japanese real estate investment trusts (J-REITs). -- The BOJ will not apply its self-imposed ceiling on its outright JGB buying to the JGBs to be purchased with the new fund. -- The BOJ will aim to bring the balance of assets purchased using the new fund to 5 trillion yen in one year, with about 3.5 trillion yen assigned for JGBs and treasury bills and about one trillion yen for CP, ABCP and corporate bonds. -- The BOJ will buy JGBs and corporate bonds with a remaining maturity of about one to two years. BACKGROUND -- The BOJ currently buys 21.6 trillion yen of JGBs outright per year. -- Under the self-imposed rule, the BOJ limits the outstanding amount of its JGB holdings to less than that of bank notes in circulation.
