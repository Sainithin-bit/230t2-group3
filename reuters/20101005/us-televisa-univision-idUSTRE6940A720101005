 MEXICO CITY  (Reuters) - New investment from Mexico's Televisa in Spanish-language broadcaster Univision will tighten the companies' grips on a growing U.S. Hispanic market, but the deal also hands Televisa some of Univision's ample debt. 

 Televisa, the soap opera powerhouse that is Mexico's top media company and one of Latin America's biggest, is investing $1.2 billion for a stake of up to 40 percent in Univision, a giant step in repairing a relationship damaged in recent years by royalty payment disputes and management fights. The news of the investment in privately held Univision by Televisa pushed the Mexican firm's stock up 12 percent in New York and nearly 11 percent in Mexico City. "It is a game-changing event for both Televisa and Univision, not only for the growth potential of the U.S. Hispanic market .. but for the potential across all (media) platforms," Televisa Executive Vice President Alfonso de Angoitia told Reuters. The agreement makes Televisa the main provider of programing that Univision broadcasts across the United States through 2020, adding three years to the previous deal as Televisa also seeks to reach U.S. Spanish speakers with its Internet and mobile phone content. The deal gives Televisa better prices for its programs and solidifies Univision's position atop the U.S. Spanish-language market, leaving NBC's Telemundo a distant second. Univision says it draws nearly 6 percent of primetime American viewers aged 18 to 49 as the Hispanic television market grows, bucking U.S. trends. "This is a very good deal (for Televisa) as it repositions it in the U.S. market," said Martin Lara, an analyst with Itau Securities. "Plus, it gets higher royalties."

Televisa subsequently fought Univision in U.S. courts for better prices for its programing. "Televisa is Univision and Univision is Televisa in the United States. Our interests are aligned now," Saban said in New York. UNIVISION FACES $10 BILLION IN DEBT But the deal, which would initially give Televisa's a 5 percent Univision stake plus a 30 percent equity stake from convertible debentures in the U.S. broadcaster, is not risk-free for Televisa. De Angoitia told Reuters that Univision must restructure $3.25 billion in debt. At least $750 million would be a long-term bond. De Angoitia, the financial mastermind who is an ally of Televisa owner Emilio Azcarraga, said Univision has $10.3 billion in debt. Under the agreement, Univision will have unrestricted use of Televisa content for television, Internet, video on demand and mobile phones, De Angoitia said. He said additional royalties would total $50 million in 2011. In 2010, he projected total royalties of $150 million. Barclays Capital projected that Televisa's royalties from Univision could triple by 2017. In exchange for the expanded rights and content, Televisa will receive through December 2017 larger royalties from Univision. Right now, royalties amount to 9.36 percent of television revenue, excluding certain soccer events, but this will rise to 11.91 percent through 2017. After that, the rate would rise to 16.22 percent. The Mexican company will have an option to buy another 5 percent of Univision in three years. U.S. law prohibits foreign broadcasters from owning over 25 percent of U.S. broadcasters. Televisa's shares were trading at $21.37, up 13 percent on the New York Stock Exchange. Shares in Mexico were up 11.9 percent at 53.40 pesos. (Reporting by Cyntia Barrera Diaz.
