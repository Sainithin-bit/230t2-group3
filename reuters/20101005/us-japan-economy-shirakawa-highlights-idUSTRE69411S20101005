 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Bank of Japan Governor Masaaki Shirakawa said on Tuesday that the central bank may increase the size of a fund pool set aside for asset buying from 5 trillion yen ($60 billion) if the need arises in the future. 

 But Shirakawa added that the timing of ending the temporary asset-buying scheme, as well as its size, would be a monetary policy decision made by carefully examining the scheme's effects and drawbacks. Following are key quotes from his news conference: MONETARY POLICY "As for the management of the fund, we would consider expanding its size if deemed necessary in guiding monetary policy. "But as the BOJ is taking such an extraordinary step, we should first firmly establish this scheme and examine what effects it will have. It will take a certain period of time for it to have an effect so we'll thoroughly examine it." ECONOMY "Basically, there's no gap in view on the economy and prices between the government and the BOJ."
