 SYDNEY  (Reuters) - Plans for the world's biggest iron ore joint venture risk falling apart, with miners BHP Billiton ( BHP.AX ) ( BLT.L ) and Rio Tinto ( RIO.AX ) ( RIO.L ) struggling to persuade competition regulators to clear the $116 billion deal. 

 Combining the pair's huge Australian iron ore mining operations would surpass Brazil's Vale ( VALE5.SA ) in size, producing a combined 385 million tons of ore initially and due to save $10 billion in costs. When the deal was hatched in 2009, Rio Tinto was heavily indebted and BHP Billiton was eager to expand further in the sector, where its production trails Rio Tinto. Rio Tinto has since cut its debt 36 percent and BHP Billiton is focused on expanding into the fertilizer industry with a $39 billion hostile offer for Potash Corp ( POT.TO ). DOES THE JV STILL MAKE SENSE? Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton say it does, but analysts are increasingly doubtful as a December 31 deadline looms. Rio Tinto recently formed a joint venture with China's Chinalco ( 2600.HK ) ( 601600.SS ) to develop the Simandou iron ore mine in Guinea, where it has already invested $680 million. Rio Tinto is also weighing up development of the big Orissa iron ore deposit in India in partnership with the government to feed India's growing market for ore. BHP Billiton has no presence in iron ore in India. In June, the pair was granted permission by the Western Australian state government to share their iron ore ports and rail lines and to blend each other's ore to better tailor their output to customers' needs. Importantly, these amendments are not dependent on the joint venture proceeding. However, BHP and Rio say it would help both realize a projected $10 billion in savings targeted through the joint venture. WOULD A JOINT VENTURE GIVE BHP AND RIO MORE MARKETING CLOUT? No. Both parties took the idea of jointly marketing ore off the table in June to try and appease customers afraid it would give BHP and Rio too much market power. All output will be sold by Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton separately if the deal proceeds. WHAT'S HOLDING UP THE JOINT VENTURE? Clearance is required from a number of competition regulators, including the European Union and the Australian Consumer Competition Commission (ACCC). The EU has not provided a timetable for its decision and the companies' recent request for an extension for the ACCC was made on the basis of needing more time to prepare new submissions to the EU.Rio Tinto iron ore chief Sam Walsh, who would become chairman of the combined group, has acknowledged that the alliance was dragging on as regulators scrutinized the deal. Shareholders must approve the deal if and when it gets the go-ahead from regulators. It will require BHP Billiton to spend at least $5.8 billion on an "equalization payment" since its iron ore business is smaller than Rio's. Rio shareholders will need to weigh up the benefits of a tie-up given Rio's independent drive to boost its iron ore business. Also, since announcing the deal, Rio Tinto has embarked on a rapid expansion plan on its own, including the commissioning of two new mines, a $1 billion investment in the Pilbara's Cape Lambert port operations and a $1.6 billion investment this week in the Hope Downs mining project.
