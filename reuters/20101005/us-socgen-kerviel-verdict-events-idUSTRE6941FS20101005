 (Reuters) - Former Societe Generale trader Jerome Kerviel was sentenced to 5 years in prison by a Paris court on Tuesday for his role in a trading scandal and ordered to reimburse the French bank 4.9 billion euros ($6.8 billion). 

 The lawyer representing Kerviel said that he would appeal the Paris court's decision. Kerviel's defense team had calling for him to be acquitted of charges of breach of trust and forgery relating to the trading loss in 2008 that almost brought SocGen to its knees. Kerviel's family has said he has been a scapegoat for the rogue trading scandal. Here is a timeline of Kerviel and what happened. 2000 -- The trader started at SocGen in the middle office, the department which controls traders' activities. 2005 -- Kerviel became an arbitrage trader, moving from back to front office in what SocGen's investment banking chief calls a "very unusual" recruitment path for a trader. His experience gave him significant knowledge of the bank's control systems. -- His job was to buy and sell similar financial instruments simultaneously, making money only on the tiny and momentary spread in prices between them -- classic arbitrage trading. 2008: January 24 - SocGen says uncovers fraud involving junior trader Jerome Kerviel, resulting in a loss of 4.9 billion euros. -- Kerviel ended up with a 50 billion euro portfolio, worth more than the bank itself. This comprised 30 billion euros worth of Eurostoxx pan-European stock index futures contracts, 18 billion on Germany's DAX futures and 2 billion on London's FTSE. -- Just one trader was used to close the huge position. The sell-off between January 21-23 generated losses of 4.9 billion euros, making the SocGen scandal the biggest in trading history. January 30 - The then SocGen Chief Executive Daniel Bouton says the bank has enough capital to stay independent. February 8 - Kerviel jailed but leaves in March after winning legal battle. February 20 - Internal investigation into trading loss finds controls at the bank lacked depth. April 17 - SocGen says Bouton is relinquishing his job as chief executive but will stay on as chairman of the board. July 4 - France's Banking Commission fines SocGen 4 million euros for serious breaches in internal controls. August 31 - Kerviel charged with fraud and breach of trust and ordered to stand trial. September 3 - Kerviel appears at a court hearing along with his former aide Thomas Mougard. Kerviel is under formal investigation for breach of trust, computer abuse and falsification, while Mougard is under investigation for complicity in the affair. Oct 6 - SocGen unveils 4.8 billion euro ($7 billion) capital hike to repay state support and pursue acquisitions. 2009: April 29, 2009 - Bouton, whose reputation was hit by a trading scandal at the bank, resigns and blames relentless verbal attacks on his performance for his decision to quit. November 10, 2009 - Kerviel loses appeal to delay trial. 2010: June - Trial of Kerviel lasts over two weeks with verdict set for on October 5. Kerviel is branded a liar who took "inhuman" risks by a former boss former head of investment banking, Jean-Pierre Mustier. October 5 - Kerviel is found guilty of breach of trust. The judges say Kerviel had not been given even tacit authorization from his bosses to speculate excessively and that SocGen's own shortcomings did not exonerate him from his duties as a professional trader. -- He is sentenced to 5 years in prison by a Paris court for his role in the scandal and is ordered to reimburse the French bank 4.9 billion euros. -- Kerviel is ordered to spend three years in prison, with the remaining two suspended.
