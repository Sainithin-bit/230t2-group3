 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The fate of the U.S. Aaa rating depends on additional deficit-reduction measures but also on the pace of economic growth and the evolution of borrowing costs, Moody's top analyst for the United States said on Tuesday. 

 One of the key questions Moody's will be asking as it makes a decision on whether to downgrade U.S. ratings in 12 to 18 months is whether the financial crisis has affected the growth potential of the United States. "Overall, we think that this is simply an adjustment period, but it seems to be quite long," Steven Hess told Reuters in an interview, referring to the disappointing economic growth figures released last week. The U.S. economy stumbled badly in the first half of 2011, coming close to contraction in the first quarter. It expanded just 0.4 percent in the first quarter, a sharp downward revision from the previously reported 1.9 percent gain, and rose 1.3 percent in the second quarter. "We would expect that growth would accelerate in 2012 from the first half of the year," Hess said. "But if it doesn't, that means that the whole process of fiscal consolidation and the plans to achieve lower deficits and lower debt ratios will be made all the more difficult." Another key consideration for Moody's will be the evolution of U.S. borrowing costs. The agency would see it as normal if yields paid on U.S. 10-year Treasury notes rise from the currently "abnormal level" of around 2.6 percent to near 4 percent by 2012 and almost 5 percent by 2016, Hess said, referring to the economic assumptions of the Congressional Budget Office. Moody's on Tuesday affirmed the U.S. Aaa rating after lawmakers agreed on a plan to avoid an imminent default. The plan also calls for deficit-reduction measures of up to $2.1 trillion in the next 10 years. "If it had been a much larger number than that, we might have had a stable outlook," Hess said.
