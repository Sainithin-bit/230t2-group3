 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - House of Representatives Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi plans to vote for a bill to raise the government's debt ceiling, a Democratic Party aide said on Monday. 

 Earlier on Monday, Pelosi said she was undecided, as she complained to reporters that the deficit-reduction part of the legislation contained no revenue increases. (Reporting by  Thomas Ferraro )
