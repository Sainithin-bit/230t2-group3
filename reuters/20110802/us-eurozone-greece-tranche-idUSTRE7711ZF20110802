 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - All euro zone countries are committed to contribute to the next tranche of aid for Greece due in September, the European Commission said on Tuesday. 

 Greece is to receive 5.8 billion euros in bilateral loans from euro zone countries and 2.2 billion euros from the International Monetary Fund. But the recent sharp rise in borrowing costs for Italy and Spain is likely to make it more expensive for the two countries to borrow on the market than the rate at which they would then lend the money to Greece. "All euro zone member states are committed to paying into the next tranche of aid for Greece," European Commission spokeswoman Chantal Hughes told a regular news briefing. "There is no suggestion that any country would not pay into the next tranche of aid for Greece, including Italy and Spain," she said. "However, if any country is faced with a higher funding costs at that point in time, when the next tranche of aid would be funded, there is a mechanism in place to ensure that they are compensated for it," she said. The issue of borrowing costs for Italy and Spain in relation to the rate at which the money would be lent to Greece was discussed at a call of euro zone officials last week, euro zone sources have told Reuters, with Italy considering "stepping out" from the next tranche or using the compensation mechanism depending on the borrowing costs at the time of disbursement.
