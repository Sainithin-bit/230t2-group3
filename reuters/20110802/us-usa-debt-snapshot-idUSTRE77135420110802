 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Here is a rundown of the final actions in Congress on Tuesday as lawmakers try to rush to the White House a deficit reduction deal that also will raise the $14.3 trillion limit on U.S. government borrowing. 

 Lawmakers have just hours before the deadline to avert an unprecedented default. * The Democratic-led Senate set to vote on the deal at noon EDT. The bill will head immediately to President Barack Obama for his signature. * Senate begins debate on the measure. It is expected to pass. * Obama plans no public signing ceremony for the bill. But he is to make a statement at the White House following the Senate votes on the bill. The statement is scheduled for 12:15 p.m. EDT. * Senate action comes after the Republican-led House of Representatives approved it on Monday night on a bipartisan vote of 269-161. * U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner tells ABC News that the contentious battle over the debt limit and the threat of default had damaged confidence in the economy and that credit rating agencies would "take a careful look" at whether lawmakers have the will to reduce deficits. * Despite the deal that will increase government borrowing authority through the 2012 presidential election year, Wall Street still worries about a possible downgrade of the U.S. AAA credit rating. U.S. stock indices open lower on Tuesday. (Reporting by  Donna Smith ; editing by  Vicki Allen  and  Jackie Frank )
