 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama thinks there should be a private solution to Lehman Brothers' current problems, a senior economic adviser said on Saturday. 

 Speaking to reporters during a teleconference, Obama aide Jason Furman was asked whether the candidate would support a government bailout of Lehman. Furman responded: "Senator Obama believes we should have a private solution to Lehman's problem. And, unlike Bear Stearns, the Federal Reserve now has a special lending facility in place that could prevent a wider run on the market." Furman also said Lehman's problems were a reminder of the need to modernize U.S. financial regulations. Obama, Furman said, "fundamentally thinks this is a real reminder of the bad decisions made both on Wall Street and Washington and the need to modernize our financial regulatory structure to prevent these types of problems." Meetings resumed on Saturday between top government officials and the heads of Wall Street investment banks over Lehman's future, according to a Federal Reserve official. Government agencies and bankers are trying to find a way to rescue Lehman and stabilize financial markets. (Reporting by  Caren Bohan  and  Richard Cowan ; Editing by  Doina Chiacu )
