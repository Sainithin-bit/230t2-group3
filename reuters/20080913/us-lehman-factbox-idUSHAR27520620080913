 (Reuters) - U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers has seen its shares shed three-quarters of their value this week as it announced a record $3.9 billion loss and a restructuring plan. The bank faces the prospect of being acquired by rivals, raising the specter of an end to its 158-year history.  

 Here is a brief history of the company: 1844 Henry Lehman, an immigrant from Germany, opens a small dry goods store in Montgomery, Alabama, in 1844. 1850 Henry is joined by brothers Emanuel and Mayer and they name the business Lehman Brothers. 1858 The Lehmans -- who take cotton from farmers to settle accounts and trade the cotton for money and merchandise -- open a New York office. 1860s After the Civil War, they move to New York and establish the New York Cotton Exchange. 1887 Become members of the New York Stock Exchange 1889 Lehman underwrites its first public offering, for the International Steam Pump Company. 1929 The Lehman Corporation is created, a closed-end investment company. 1930s Lehman underwrites the IPO of DuMont, the first television manufacturer. 1950s Underwrites the IPOs of Digital Equipment and Hertz Rent-a-Car 1960 Opens a Paris office. 1962 With Salomon Brothers, Merrill Lynch and Blyth and Company, Lehman forms an association nicknamed the "fearsome foursome" that challenges the major firms for underwriting business. 1972 Becomes one of the first investment banks to open an office in London to take advantage of the booming bond market in Europe. 1975 Lehman acquires Abraham & Co. 1984 American Express acquires Lehman Brothers and merges it with Shearson. 1986 Seat on the London Stock Exchange 1988 Seat on the Tokyo Stock Exchange 1993 American Express divests Shearson, and the independent firm once again becomes known as Lehman Brothers. 1994 Lehman becomes independent through a public stock offering and Lehman Brothers Holding Inc common stock begins trading on the New York & Pacific stock exchanges. 1994 Richard Fuld Jr takes the top job at Lehman. 1998 Fuld fights off rumors that the near collapse of Long Term Capital Management had caused a cash crunch at Lehman. 1999 Lehman establishes an alliance with Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi for Japanese mergers and acquisitions. 2001 Under pressure to cut costs, Fuld decides to pay staff less and in stock, rather than lay off employees. 2002 Lehman establishes its wealth and asset management division and acquires Lincoln Capital Management's fixed income business. 2003 Lehman acquires Neuberger Berman and The Crossroads Group. 2007 Lehman posts record-high net revenues, net income and earnings per common share (diluted) for a fourth consecutive year and the highest volume of trade on the London Stock Exchange for a third year in a row.
