 ROME  (Reuters) - The bankruptcy commissioner in charge of Alitalia has called the airline's unions to an urgent meeting at 1200 GMT on Saturday, Alitalia said in a statement. 

 The airline faces imminent collapse if there is no breakthrough on a deal between unions and a group of investors that has agreed to buy a slimmed-down version of the carrier, the government has said. (Reporting by  Robin Pomeroy )
