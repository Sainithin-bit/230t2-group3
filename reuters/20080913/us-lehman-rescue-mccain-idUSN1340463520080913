 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Using taxpayer money to support Lehman Brothers should be avoided, a top economic adviser to Republican presidential nominee John McCain said on Saturday. 

 "I have not heard of any proposal for taxpayer money (to be used) ... and obviously that would be something that is not anyone's first choice," Douglas Holtz-Eakin told Reuters. "What's going on is a private-sector transaction and that's, you know, that's fine." Holtz-Eakin said regulators should be ready to act if approval of the sale of Lehman assets were required. "To the best of our understanding, Lehman is trying to arrange for a sale of some or all of its assets as part of solving what could be some financial distresses," he said. "That's a private matter. One would hope that regulators are, you know, examining the books so they can approve any sale if necessary." (Reporting by  Jeff Mason ; Editing by  Doina Chiacu )
