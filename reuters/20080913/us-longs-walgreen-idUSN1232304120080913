 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Walgreen Co ( WAG.N ) said on Friday that it offered to buy Longs Drug Stores Corp LDG.N for $75 per share in cash, or $3 billion including debt, countering an offer from rival CVS Caremark ( CVS.N ) that had been spurned by top investors. 

 Walgreen said its offer represented a $3.50 premium over the purchase price offered by CVS on August 12 and that it was also prepared to pay the $115 million termination fee for the CVS deal on top of the $75 per share offer. Earlier Friday, Advisory Research Inc, the biggest Longs shareholder, had said it would not sell its shares to CVS because the offer price was too low. Advisory said Longs' board did not fully analyze the value of its real estate and leases when it agreed to the bid from larger rival CVS. Moreover, Advisory cited an analysis released by RiskMetrics -- which also recommended that shareholders not tender shares -- that said Longs failed to seize a "prime opportunity to create a heated auction." A day earlier, another Longs investor Pershing Square Capital Management had said it wouldn't support the CVS offer and was looking for higher bids. Advisory Research and Pershing Square were not immediately available for comment on the Walgreen move. CVS was not immediately available for comment on Friday evening but it had said in response to the shareholder comments that it was sticking to its offer of $71.50 per share. Walgreen, which has about 6,443 stores in 49 states, had held unsuccessful takeover talks with Longs before. After the breakdown of those talks, Longs recommended shareholders accept the CVS offer. A deal for CVS would mean a stronger presence against its biggest competitor, Walgreen, and a greater footprint in California. Longs operates some 521 stores in California, Nevada, Arizona and Hawaii, where CVS does not operate. In addition to the drugstores, Longs' eventual buyer will acquire its RxAmerica LLC subsidiary, which offers prescription benefits management services. Walgreen said on Friday that in prior discussions with Longs it had said it would be willing to offer up to $70 per share in cash for the company, subject to its receipt of due diligence materials, which it said it were never provided. The drugstore operator said that while it would prefer to work directly with Longs it was prepared to take its proposal directly to shareholders. Walgreen said it is working with Lubert-Adler Management Company and Klaff Realty to address any potential store sales in connection with the transaction. Goldman Sachs & Co is serving as financial advisor to Walgreen on the deal and Weil, Gotshall and Manges is serving as its legal adviser. (Reporting by  Sinead Carew ; Editing by  Gary Hill ))
