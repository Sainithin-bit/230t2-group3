 ROME  (Reuters) - Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi called airline unions to emergency talks on Saturday evening in a last-ditch effort to save national flag carrier Alitalia from collapse. 

 The airline said it may have to ground planes from Monday as it could not secure fuel from wary suppliers and Italy's aviation authority said that put its operating license at risk. "We're holding our breath," Berlusconi told reporters waiting for news outside his central Rome apartment. Labor Minister Maurizio Sacconi told ANSA news agency there was "a point beyond which (talking) becomes useless and we are very close to that point". Once a symbol of Italy's post-war boom, Alitalia has for years suffered from political interference, labor disputes, financial woes and most recently from soaring fuel costs -- which are taking down other airlines around the world. Britain's third largest package holiday operator XL Leisure Group grounded all flights on Friday after going into administration. Discount transatlantic carrier Zoom Airlines began bankruptcy proceedings last month. Letting Alitalia collapse would be a huge political blow for Berlusconi who promised voters who returned him to power this year that he would use his business contacts to find an Italian buyer for the near-bankrupt airline. Unions have rejected the terms of a takeover by a consortium of Italian investors which would have meant thousands of job cuts and lower pay as the airline would have been reborn as a smaller carrier, stripped of loss-making operations and debt pile. Alitalia's bankruptcy commissioner, Augusto Fantozzi, has said the only alternative to the rescue plan is liquidation. So far he has held off from winding up the airline but said on Saturday Alitalia's situation was "plummeting". Pope Benedict, who flew to France on a chartered Alitalia flight on Friday, said he was praying for the airline, which has not been in profit since 1999 and had nearly 1.2 billion euros ($1.68 billion) in debt as of July. SILENT Hundreds of airline staff, who had been holding a noisy demonstration at Rome's Fiumicino airport, fell silent as the news that planes would start to be grounded was read out by a union official. "We want to affect public opinion and we hope for an immediate intervention from the government to find a solution worthy of our airline," said one 22-year-old air steward who declined to give his name. With strict European Union rules banning state aid to airlines, the government, which still holds a 49.9 percent stake in the carrier, has limited options. As the rescue plan looked doomed, Berlusconi turned on his political foes. "Alitalia's destiny has been put into doubt by the unreasonable behavior of a few of the employees and we see the strong influence of the left," he said. In April, Alitalia's unions sank a deal agreed under the previous, centre-left, government to sell the airline to Air France-KLM, a deal that Berlusconi, then in opposition, said he would block if he came into power. With Alitalia unable to secure fuel supplies, civil aviation authority Enac said its license was in jeopardy. "If there is no solution very soon that guarantees the continuity of the carrier's operations, the basis on which Enac issued Alitalia with a six-month provisional license will no longer be met," Enac said in a statement. The consortium, CAI, has not withdrawn its takeover offer, but said it would not make additional concessions to employees. "We repeated to (Berlusconi aide Gianni) Letta our position: ready to talk but steadfast on the contents (of a deal)," CAI Chief Executive Rocco Sabelli told reporters.
