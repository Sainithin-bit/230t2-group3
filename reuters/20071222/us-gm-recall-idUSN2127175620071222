 DETROIT  (Reuters) - General Motors Corp said on Friday it is recalling 275,936 Cadillacs, Pontiacs and Saturns sold in the United States because of a fluid leak that could lead to loss of control of the vehicle. 

 The recall involves vehicles 2005-2007 model year Cadillac CTS, CTS-V and STS, STS-V sedans, 2005-2007 model year Cadillac SRX crossovers, and 2006-2007 model year Pontiac Solstice and the 2007 Saturn Sky. GM spokeswoman Carolyn Markey said the seal on the rear axle pinion, which provides power to the rear wheels, could leak fluid, causing the wheels to seize and lock. Markey said one crash was reported related to the problems. (Reporting by  Poornima Gupta , editing by Leslie Gevirtz)
