 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group's ( GS.N ) board of directors awarded a $67.9 million bonus to Chairman and Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein for 2007, according to a filing with regulators. 

 The bonus comes after a fiscal year of record profits, even as rivals sustained large write-downs from the widening subprime crisis. Blankfein received $41.1 million of restricted shares and options, as well as cash of $26.8 million, the filing said. (Reporting by  Dan Wilchins ; Editing by  Andre Grenon )
