 PARIS  (Reuters) - The French Constitutional Council's rejection on Saturday of a 75 percent upper income tax rate and other minor measures in the 2013 budget will affect some 300-500 million euros worth of tax revenues, Finance Minister Pierre Moscovici said. 
 "The rejected measures represent 300 to 500 million euros. Our deficit-cutting path will not be affected," Moscovici told BFM television. He added that the Socialist government would resubmit a proposal to raise taxes on high incomes in 2013 and 2014. (Reporting by Julien Ponthus and  Catherine Bremer ; Editing by  Mark Heinrich )
