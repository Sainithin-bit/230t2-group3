 DETROIT  (Reuters) - General Motors Co GM.UL posted a 6.4 percent gain in U.S. April sales on Monday, helped by strong demand for newly launched vehicles such as the Chevy Equinox crossover and the Buick LaCrosse sedan. 

 GM sold 183,997 vehicles in April, up from 173,007 vehicles the same month a year ago when U.S. auto sales were near the bottom of a punishing slump and the automaker was sliding toward bankruptcy. Sales for GM's four remaining brands -- Chevrolet, Buick, GMC and Cadillac -- rose 20 percent from a year earlier to 183,091 vehicles. Sales of the brands GM has dropped through its U.S. government-funded restructuring -- Hummer, Pontiac, Saab and Saturn -- plunged by 96 percent to just 906 vehicles as dealers sold off remaining inventory.
