 OMAHA, Nebraska  (Reuters) - Warren Buffett said on Saturday he has not been contacted by federal investigators pursuing the largest U.S. hedge fund insider trading case in history, centered on Galleon Group and its founder Raj Rajaratnam. 

 Buffett spoke at the annual meeting of his Berkshire Hathaway Inc ( BRKa.N ) ( BRKb.N ) insurance and investment company. The billionaire investor's involvement has been the source of speculation, given Berkshire's $5 billion investment in Goldman Sachs Group Inc ( GS.N ), and the reported relationship between Goldman director Rajat Gupta and Rajaratnam. Last month, the Wall Street Journal said Gupta told Rajaratnam about Berkshire's investment in Goldman before it became public, citing an unnamed source. Gupta's departure from Goldman's board of directors was announced in March. The case is U.S. v. Rajaratnam et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 09-01184.
