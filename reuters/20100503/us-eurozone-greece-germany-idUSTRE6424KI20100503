 BERLIN  (Reuters) - Chancellor Angela Merkel began a tough drive to sell a bailout plan for Greece to skeptical Germans on Monday, saying it would help stabilize the euro. 

 The cabinet swiftly approved Berlin's 22.4 billion euro ($29.83 billion) share of the 110 billion euros in emergency loans agreed by European finance ministers on Sunday. Both houses of parliament are expected to vote on it on Friday. The conservative chancellor had resisted any German help for Greece, due largely to fierce public opposition before a key election next Sunday in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia. However, she bowed to pressure from the EU and IMF last week as market turmoil grew, throwing her support behind a rescue. Now she has set about convincing voters, giving interviews to a number of Germany's main television stations on Monday. "We said time and again, if the stability of our currency was in danger, we would act quickly and decisively. And this is the point that we've reached," Merkel told ZDF television. "So nobody should be surprised that we tried to do everything to avoid getting to that point." Germany and its euro zone partners aim to approve the necessary legislation for Greece this week, Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said. Summing up German public outrage at the bailout, the mass circulation Bild daily screamed: "Broke Greece gets the fattest cheque in history." Europe's largest economy is to pay the biggest share of any EU state, taking on 28 percent of the loans, said Merkel. If Greece defaults on the loan, German taxpayers will pay. Germany, which has taken a series of measures in recent years to curb its own budget deficit, had taken a stand against a quick Greek bailout to try and raise pressure on other states to take more responsibility for their own finances. It had been the main driver in insisting on fiscal discipline within the euro zone when the currency was created, arguing this was needed to prevent inflation, a particular German fear due to hyper-inflation in its past. Merkel, however, tried to sell the Greek bail-out as a one-off which would not undermine the future stability of the currency. SEEKING CONSENSUS She told ZDF television EU budget rules needed reforming to prevent future crises, adding that she was initially banking on support on this from the Netherlands, Finland and France. She added that she was not worried that Portugal could be the next euro zone member state to seek aid. In an interview due to appear in Tuesday's Rheinische Post daily, Schaeuble said temporary suspension of EU voting rights was one future sanction that budgetary sinners could face. "And also that member states which break the rules should not receive payments from the (EU) Cohesion Fund for a certain period," he said, adding that funds for Greece could still be suspended if Athens did not stick to its savings program. Sunday's regional poll could rob Merkel's coalition with the Free Democrats (FDP) of a majority in the upper house of parliament and force her to rethink tax cut plans and health reform. The FDP's even tougher line against Greek aid, along with the unpopularity of its leader, has backfired as the party looks set to be the biggest loser in the state vote. However, after months of resisting a bailout, many lawmakers and commentators have concluded there is no alternative. Business daily Handelsblatt even ran a front-page article highlighting investors vowing to buy Greek debt. Merkel also tried to win over opposition Social Democrats (SPD), who want tighter rules for speculators and banks to be linked to the bailout as their price for voting for the law. She said she wanted to tighten financial market regulation and that a European credit rating agency should be created. Joachim Poss, deputy head of the SPD parliamentary party, said his party would decide whether to back the package after talks with the government, and urged Merkel to fight speculation and press for an effective financial transaction tax in Europe. Merkel's conservatives have repeatedly vowed to work on tighter rules to rein in speculators and her government is trying to get banks on board with the rescue. Addressing this, Merkel told RTL television that betting against Greece on the markets had to stop. "What's particularly crucial now is that speculation against Greece is curbed," she said in an interview. Finance Minister Schaeuble said he planned to meet financial sector representatives to talk about their involvement in the rescue before a first parliamentary reading on Wednesday. Merkel does not need the SPD to get parliamentary approval but she would prefer to have cross-party backing on the issue. The SPD could stall the program by insisting on committee hearings, which could rattle the euro and embarrass Merkel. While Merkel has wooed domestic voters and tried to ensure the aid penalties are tough enough to put off other euro zone members seeking help, she has drawn attack from some in the euro zone who blame her for exacerbating the crisis. Critics say her procrastination has undermined market confidence in the euro zone's ability to sort out the crisis and made the bailout more expensive. Once a darling of the EU, Merkel has in the last few months baffled some of her colleagues in the 27-member bloc with numerous reversals in her public statements on aid for Greece. "Merkel has employed tactics ahead of the vote in North Rhine-Westphalia which have caused her to be celebrated as the 'Iron Lady'," Poss told ZDF television, referring to former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. If the law goes through parliament, it faces a legal challenge from German economist Joachim Starbatty who plans to file a suit with the country's Constitutional Court. He argues that aid would breach a bailout ban set out in EU treaties. For more stories on Greece, click on (Additional reporting by  Dave Graham  and  Paul Carrel , editing by Myra MacDonald)
