 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co ( F.N ) posted a 25 percent increase in its April U.S. sales from a year earlier, propelled by record sales of its Fusion mid-size sedan and robust demand for trucks led by the F-series pickup. 

 Ford sold 167,542 vehicles in the U.S. market in April, compared to 134,401 vehicles the same month a year earlier. Excluding Volvo, the premium brand Ford has agreed to sell to China's Geely, sales rose 26 percent to 162,996 vehicles for its Ford, Lincoln and Mercury brands. Car sales were up 10 percent from a year ago, while truck sales surged 38 percent. Ford gained U.S. retail market share for the 18th time in the last 19 months. Shares of Ford were up 1.7 percent, or 22 cents, to $13.25 on the New York Stock Exchange. (Reporting by  Soyoung Kim )
