 DETROIT  (Reuters) - U.S. safety regulators have opened an investigation to review a potential sticky accelerator pedal problem in Chrysler Group LLC's 2007 model-year Dodge Caliber cars. 

 The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said in a document posted on its website that five consumers reported that the accelerator pedal became stuck and would not return to the idle position when released. Elkhart, Indiana-based supplier CTS Corp made the pedals involved in the Chrysler investigation. CTS is also the supplier of pedals involved in Toyota Motor Corp's January recall of more than 2 million vehicles. Chrysler said its own review has found that consumer complaints were limited to about 10,000 Calibers built during a five-week window in March and April 2006. The NHTSA probe covers some 161,000 Dodge Calibers built for the 2007 model year. Chrysler and NHTSA said they were not aware of any accidents, injuries or property damage related to the issue. "It appears to be a supplier manufacturing concern, which is mechanical in nature and not a design or electronic issue," Chrysler said in a statement. The automaker also said the vehicle is equipped with a brake override system, which allows the engine controller to reduce power and stop the car when both the brake and the accelerator are depressed. CTS representatives were not immediately available to comment. CTS shares rose 3 percent, or 32 cents, to $10.82 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
