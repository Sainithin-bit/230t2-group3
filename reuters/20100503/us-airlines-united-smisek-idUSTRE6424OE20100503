 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Fifteen years ago, before he was tapped to become the chief executive of the world's largest airline, Jeffery Smisek was a Houston lawyer with standing orders with his secretary to avoid Continental Airlines. 

 He considered the airline "lousy," wrote former Continental CEO Gordon Bethune in his book, "From Worst to First: Behind the Scenes of Continental's Remarkable Comeback." But when the colorful Bethune began crafting a management team to spur the transformation of twice-bankrupt Continental, he turned to "the smartest and best attorney we could find." "I asked him if he was a T-bill kind of investor or whether he took gambles," Bethune wrote of Smisek, who was with Vinson & Elkins LLP. "It turned out he took gambles." Since then, Smisek has scaled the ranks of Continental's management, starting as general counsel and eventually becoming chief executive in January this year. Smisek, now 55, is undertaking a different kind of risk with the proposed merger of Continental and United Airlines that would make him chief executive of the world's largest airline, if the deal is approved by regulators. United, a unit of UAL Corp, said it would buy Continental on Monday in an all-stock deal, two years after Continental spurned similar overtures from United. As a Continental board member, Smisek voted against merging with United in 2008, but much has changed since then. Airlines have strengthened their balance sheets, and Delta Air Lines muscled up by buying Northwest Airlines, a marriage that analysts see as a success. "It's a whole different world today," said David Siegel, a former Continental executive who met Smisek in 1995 during Smisek's hiring process. "Jeff is bright enough and bold enough to say there was a right answer two years ago and the right answer today may or may not be different." SWIFT AND SAVVY Monday's proposed merger might never have happened without Smisek, who has made his mark in the past five months, said airline consultant Robert Mann of RW Mann & Co. Since Smisek took the reins, Continental has added fees for meals and exit row seats -- changes the company might have balked at earlier, analysts said. Days after he succeeded outgoing CEO Larry Kellner, Smisek told employees that he would not take an annual salary or a bonus unless the company turned an annual profit. "I think a lot of the new appearance of far more urgency is purely up to Jeff," said Mann. Those who have worked with Smisek describe him as a swift, savvy decision maker not known to mince words. At a March investor conference he compared Delta to a "woman who wants to poison your food." But Smisek can also be a smooth talker, one who played a key role in boosting Continental's operations at Newark Liberty airport near New York to create a global gateway in the late 1990s. "In the early meetings, there was some skepticism on our part that they were really going to make that big of a commitment," said Susan Baer, director of aviation for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. The Port Authority operates New York-area airports. "They moved like lightening to get that project done," Baer said, adding that Smisek was critical to this process. Outside of the boardroom, Smisek is known for his dry wit. Colleagues describe him as a voracious reader attached to his Kindle-- he's currently reading "Augustus: The Life of Rome's First Emperor" by Anthony Everitt. They also said he's a family man. His wife, Diana, is a professor at Rice University. He has two sons, one teaches English in China and the other is in college. Smisek graduated from Princeton University with a degree in economics and later Harvard Law School. He then embarked on a 12-year legal career at Vinson & Elkins. "He's a bit of a savant, probably from his legal training," said Siegel, now chief executive of charter airline XOJET. "There could be a 1,000-page document and somehow he'll zero in on page 547, line 4 and say, 'this is the issue.'" Added Siegel: "And you're still trying to figure out where the front cover was on the document." 'WARP SPEED' "We moved at warp speed," Smisek said of the merger discussions with United, which lasted about three weeks. Through last year, Continental maintained it would prefer to remain an independent airline. But at the March conference, Smisek appeared to signal a shift in tone when he said the company might "bulk up defensively" if needed. Now Smisek is in line to head a company with a work force of nearly 90,000 and a fleet of nearly 700 planes that will transport 144 million passengers a year. "I can hardly think of an industry that is as wonderfully complex as the airline business," said George Parker, a former Continental board member and an emeritus professor of finance at the Stanford University business school. "(Smisek) has always come across to me as being eminently able to deal with that." Mann noted that the industry will be watching Smisek's effort to weave the two companies together closely. "What happens when your piece of the combined firm is the smaller part?" Mann asked. "It will be very interesting. But there's a guy who loves challenges."
