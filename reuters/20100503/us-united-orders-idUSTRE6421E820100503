 (Reuters) - A planned merger of two U.S. companies to create the world's largest airline will combine Continental's Boeing-dominated fleet with the mixed fleet and order book of United. 

 The move was expected to trigger a scramble between Boeing and European rival Airbus, as well as engine makers, over the fate of almost $22 billion in outstanding plane orders and control of any future fleet replacement decisions. United recently split a $10 billion wide-body order between Boeing and Airbus and had been expected to return to the market later this year to renew its single-aisle fleet. The merger came weeks after United finalized the Airbus part of the wide-body deal, which is an order for 25 A350s provisionally announced in December. Following are the jetliners on order and yet to be delivered for each airline, valued at latest published list prices: CONTINENTAL ----------- AIRBUS None BOEING 22 737-700 single-aisle $1,408m 13 737-800 single-aisle $998m 6 737-900ER single-aisle $489m 3 777-200ER wide-body $437m 11 787-8 wide-body $1,829m 14 787-9 wide-body $2,797m Total Boeing $7,958m Total Airbus + Boeing $7,958m UNITED ------ AIRBUS 23 A319 single-aisle $1,711m 19 A320 single-aisle $1,547m 25 A350-900 wide-body $6,363m Total Airbus $9,621m BOEING 25 787-8 wide-body $4,156m Total Boeing $4,156m Total Airbus + Boeing $13,777m MERGED AIRLINE -------------- Airbus $9,621m Boeing $12,114m Airbus + Boeing $21,735m (Reporting by  Tim Hepher ; Editing by Dan Lalor)
