 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Berkshire Hathaway Inc ( BRKa.N ) chief Warren Buffett said on Monday he did not think Goldman Sachs Group Inc ( GS.N ) Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein should resign. 

 "I do not think Lloyd at all should step down. I would be disappointed if he stepped down," Buffett said in an interview with ABC TV that aired on "Good Morning America". (Reporting by  Deborah Charles , editing by Gerald E. McCormick)
