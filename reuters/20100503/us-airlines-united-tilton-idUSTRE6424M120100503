 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - United Airlines Chief Executive Glenn Tilton sought a merger with rivals for years but it took a failed deal and a rebounding economy to strike an agreement with Continental Airlines. 

 Tilton, 62, was an unlikely choice when he joined a reeling United in 2002 as a career oil industry executive. Within months, the company was in bankruptcy and a long restructuring had begun to shrink operations and allow it to better deal with volatile fuel prices, fare wars and labor unions. "I'm sure when he walked in he didn't know what he was getting into," Bill Swelbar, an economic analyst at MIT and a board member of Hawaiian Airlines said. "There was no upside in sight. It was a very difficult period." Tilton speaks three languages and has an international relations degree from the University of South Carolina. He built a professional reputation in marketing and strategic restructuring, attaining the top rung briefly at Texaco before the company merged with Chevron. Those who know him say he is resilient. Tilton has said that running an airline is "not for the faint of heart." To change the culture and company fortunes, Tilton took on powerful labor unions. They became ferocious critics after United slashed pay and benefits, and canceled union pensions in bankruptcy. United said the move to terminate pensions was necessary to finance its Chapter 11 exit. Pilots questioned his judgment and at one point called for his ouster. They produced an anti-Tilton web site, angered at rising executive compensation and what they considered was a head-long run for a merger. Tilton's 2009 pay was $3.8 million, most of it in stock and option awards. "I think he had to play hardball, which really wasn't his style in some ways," said Joseph Schwieterman, a transportation expert at DePaul University and a former United pricing analyst. More than once, Wall Street analysts questioned whether once venerable United could survive. Merger efforts intensified in 2008 with the industry in the throes of new economic turmoil driven by record high fuel prices. Tilton nearly pulled off a deal with Continental, which walked away at the last minute over concerns with United's balance sheet. Tilton responded with a series of top-level management changes. He "stepped sideways" and elevated John Tague to president of the airline, giving him responsibility for turning around United's sagging customer image and improving performance across the operation. Tague has kept a tight grip on capacity. He named Kathryn Mikells UAL's chief financial officer and she was to reassure potential merger partners that United's strategic decision-making was profit-oriented. Analyst Bob Mann, an veteran airline industry consultant, said Tilton had to make "a lot of changes in the organization to facilitate changes in the airline." The result has been better performance. Others say the improving economy also helped United's case for attracting Continental as a full partner to create a new company of which he will serve as nonexecutive chairman. United, like other rivals, has been able to sell more premium business class tickets at higher fares this year while cutting capacity -- making fewer seats available for sale. MIT's Swelbar said despite criticism of Tilton from many quarters, United became a "significantly better and more sustainable place" compared to when he arrived.
