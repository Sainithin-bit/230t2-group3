 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - The world's top private-sector bankers backed Greece's bailout package but gave few details of what role the financial sector will play alongside governments and international agencies, keeping markets jittery. 

 Board members of the Institute of International Finance (IIF), a global banking lobby group with more than 390 members "expressed their support" for a Greek bailout in a statement. IIF board members include top officials from banks and insurers UBS, BBVA, HSBC, Commerzbank, Swiss Re, Intesa Sanpaolo, Societe Generale, BNP Paribas, Erste Bank and Deutsche Bank. The pledge came as European finance ministers prepared to ask banks to keep their exposure to Greek borrowers at current levels for the duration of the EU/IMF aid package for Greece, so as not to undermine the bailout. On Sunday, European finance ministers triggered a 110 billion euro ($147 billion) bailout for Greece after Athens committed itself to years of painful austerity. "Given the importance of contributing to the restoration of confidence and stability in the circumstances surrounding Greece, IIF board members have agreed to play their part in supporting the Greek government and Greek banks," the IIF said. "This will be in the collective interest of their institutions, stakeholders, Greece, and the European and global financial systems," the group said. PRIVATE SECTOR IN BACKGROUND It urged "all parties, including other banks and investors, to assess the altered situation facing Greece as a result of the reinforced measures and substantial support package announced." Rescue funds were set to start flowing to debt-ridden Greece this week, but fears about the viability of the largest ever bailout of a country has rattled the same markets it had intended to soothe. The measures come in addition to a push by Deutsche Bank chief executive Josef Ackermann, who also chairs the IIF, to involve the German private sector in the aid package, a senior banking source had told Reuters on Friday. The consortium has pledged to contribute 1-2 billion euros toward the effort although details remained sketchy. Deutsche Bank declined to comment on the plan, which would mark the first private-sector involvement in the Greek rescue. The Financial Times Deutschland reported on Monday that insurers Allianz and Munich RE were willing to contribute toward a Greek rescue package. The insurers and industrial group Siemens declined comment. Carmaker Daimler said it had not been approached and would not take part.
