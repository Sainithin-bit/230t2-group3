 VIENNA  (Reuters) - Austria's move to help its banks with state funds is less aimed at shoring up troubled lenders and more at boosting credit and growth in emerging Europe, where its banks dominate and it could lose heavily from a downturn. 

 The Austrian financial sector's lucrative grip on the former Communist part of Europe, which contributed 42 percent of its profits last year, has turned into a risk. It has even made it relatively more expensive for the government to borrow and has driven up costs to insure against its default in recent months. Austrian banks are owed $290 billion by borrowers from Albania to Russia. Its exposure is much higher than that of Italy, Germany and France, and almost on par with what Spain has lent to Latin America, according to the Bank for International Settlements. Relative to the size of the Alpine country, the exposure -- roughly equal to its gross domestic product -- is daunting. In other words: should the recent central European hiccup turn into a crisis of Asian or Latin American proportions, with currencies devaluing and debtors defaulting en masse, Austria would be in trouble, and more so than any other western country. This fact has shaped how the Austrian government is using its 100 billion euro ($129 billion) banking package. The finance ministry last week agreed to boost the capital of Erste Group Bank by 2.7 billion euros, even though the bank, emerging Europe's third-biggest lender, is well-capitalized and funded. The state money came cheaper and with fewer strings attached than similar deals in Germany or Belgium. There are few rules on how to use the capital -- just enough to allow the government to present the measure as boosting domestic credit. In reality, most of the capital is going to underpin lending in countries including Romania, where Erste owns the biggest bank, or Hungary, where it is number 6. "That this is about providing credit to Austrian companies is just a pretense," said Matthias Siller, who manages emerging market funds at Baring Asset Management. "This move is a clear commitment to eastern Europe. "But this has nothing to do with charity. Those (Austrian) banks are system-relevant banks in central and Eastern Europe, and if they had to withdraw capital from there, this would set off a landslide," he said. HUNGARY, ROMANIA, BALTICS Several emerging countries in Europe share the problem of a gaping hole in their current accounts which they currently fill to a large extent through the funding that Austrian, Italian, French, Belgian and Swedish parent banks provide. Fears that they were about to choke off lending because the parents themselves had trouble refinancing played a big role when investors dumped Hungarian assets in droves last month. Under pressure from the Hungarian central bank, the foreign parents had to pledge publicly to continue to grant credit to Hungarian clients to help calm the markets. By tapping their home governments, the banks effectively lean on taxpayers in their home countries for refinancing countries with large current account imbalances -- which also include Romania, Bulgaria and the Baltics. "Given the expansion of the Austrian banking system into central and Eastern Europe, (the Austrian government is) implicitly providing a 'vendor-financing' deal," said Ian Harnett of Absolute Strategy Research. "The banks are simply passing their financing problems onto the public sector," he said. By accepting the state money Erste ended a game of chicken in which every Austrian bank appeared to fear the embarrassment of being the first to ask for some of the 15 billion euros Austria has set aside for capital measures. As it turned out, the market loved the deal, and Erste's shares have gained 17 percent since. That reaction makes it a likely blueprint for other Austrian banks, such as Raiffeisen Zentralbank (RZB), whose Raiffeisen International arm is the second-biggest lender in the region, and even UniCredit's Bank Austria, the No.1. However, some analysts doubt it will be enough to rely on small, disproportionally affected countries to shoulder the risk if things begin to head downwards on a bigger scale in emerging Europe. "If there is no EU-wide plan then it will be left to Sweden (in the Baltics) and Austria (on the Balkans) to take care of this," said Lars Christensen, an analyst at Danske Bank. "Obviously you can't have the Austrian government bailing out central and Eastern Europe," he added. "The problem in this situation is a lack of coordination between European Union governments about a stabilization plan for Eastern Europe." (Reporting by Boris Groendahl; Editing by  Chris Wickham )
