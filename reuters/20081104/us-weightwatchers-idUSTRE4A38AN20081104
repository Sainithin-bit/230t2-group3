 (Reuters) - Weight Watchers International Inc ( WTW.N ) posted quarterly earnings that topped market estimates, but cut its full-year outlook to provision for expenses related to its new venture in China and certain tax charges in the UK. 

 For 2008, the company expects earnings of $2.75 to $2.78 per share, including expenses related to the launch of its China joint venture and the current year portion of the UK value-added tax charges from a recent adverse ruling, the company said in a statement. The company had earlier forecast full-year earnings of $2.85 to $2.96 a share. Weight Watchers and French food group Danone ( DANO.PA ) had launched a weight-management services pilot center in Shanghai on September 12. On June 25, the company received an adverse ruling from the UK Court of Appeal on the imposition of value-added tax on Weight Watchers meetings fees collected since April 1, 2005, by its UK unit. Shares of the company were trading up 6 percent at $32.00 after the bell. They closed down nearly 6 percent at $30.12 Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange.
