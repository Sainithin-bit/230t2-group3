 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Additional help for distressed U.S. automakers is under consideration by Democratic congressional leaders, but the shape of any assistance and a timeframe for action must await the outcome of Tuesday's election, aides said. 

 House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California received an update on Monday from senior Michigan lawmakers on Detroit's worsening financial situation. Pelosi also spoke with Senate Majority leader Harry Reid in a call described as a private conversation. The meeting occurred as General Motors Corp, Ford Motor Co and Chrysler LLC issued fresh data on the collapsing U.S. auto market. Their sales fell by nearly a third in October, led by GM's 45 percent plunge. Major suppliers and other related companies have also reported serious financial difficulties as they, too, confront choked off credit markets, broad liquidity constraints, and a weak U.S. economy. Aides said congressional Democratic leaders understand the worsening financial plight and want to work with struggling companies. One senior official called the aid discussions ongoing. Congress plans to meet later this month in an abbreviated session, but whether that will present an opportunity to help Detroit is unclear. Democrats are expected to add to their majorities in both the House and Senate on Tuesday, potentially changing the dynamic for moving an economic stimulus package this year. Lawmakers have said a stimulus bill would be a logical approach for helping automakers. The Bush administration has expressed interest in stimulus legislation but has made no commitments. The Treasury Department has extended or plans to extend help through its financial services rescue to financing units at Ford, GM and Chrysler as a way to stimulate consumer borrowing and boost sales. The administration last week rebuffed GM on its request for capital to help it finance a merger with Chrysler. Congress approved $25 billion in loans in September to help carmakers develop more fuel-efficient vehicles. But that financing may not be available until much later this year or next, a timeframe widely considered impractical for addressing the industry's pressing needs. Lawmakers allied with the industry have said they are working to facilitate another $25 billion in loans that would materialize faster and include conditions, but also give carmakers more flexibility on how to spend it.
