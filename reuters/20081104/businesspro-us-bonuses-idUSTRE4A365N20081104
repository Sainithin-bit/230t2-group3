 LONDON  (Reuters) - Up to 5O percent of executive bonus schemes should be based on delivery against future performance targets, London Business School professor and City veteran Sir Andrew Likierman said on Tuesday. 

 Speaking at a seminar on corporate governance organized by pensions industry body NAPF, Likierman said: "25 to 50 percent of the annual bonus of an executive should be based on their ability to deliver performance in the future." Liekierman adds his voice to a growing clamour to unwind an executive remuneration system which is seen as a factor in exacerbating the global financial crisis. The bonus culture, particularly in banks, has come under fire for encouraging risk-taking to boost short-term performance. A crackdown on bank pay has been a key talking point around the British government's bailout plan and bankers themselves are also rethinking the system [ID:nL4752354]. The Association of British Insurers (ABI) last week told Reuters it wanted EU-wide action to introduce bonus clawback clauses on executive contracts in the event of misstated accounts or deals that turn out to be loss-making. Likierman cited a study by JP Morgan which showed that while 40 percent of the factors it defines as key business drivers look to future performance - such as branding, innovation and capital expenditure - less than 10 percent of remuneration is based on meeting forward-looking targets. Likierman - currently a non-executive director at the Bank of England and at Barclays Plc. ( BARC.L ) - added that in order to be able to assess performance, remuneration committees must employ non-financial measures and judgment. He said the basis of these judgments should be detailed in companies' annual reports and highlighted insurance company Aviva Plc ( AV.L ), which he said had published an "extremely detailed" breakdown of executive targets, steps taken to achieve them and the level of bonus paid.
