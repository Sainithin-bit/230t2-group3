 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Dean Foods Co ( DF.N ), the largest U.S. dairy company, posted a third-quarter profit that missed Wall Street forecasts, hurt by higher costs for organic milk and butter fat. 

 Dean also forecast full-year earnings below analysts' estimates and issued a 2009 outlook that could trail expectations. Consumers trading down to lower-priced private-label products, a drag on profits from the Horizon Organic milk business and other factors probably offset lower commodity costs in 2008, Morgan Stanley analyst William Pecoriello said in a note. Shares of Dean, which had risen about 20 percent in the past week, fell more than 16 percent in morning trading. Dean Foods also announced a joint venture with Hero Group to make chilled fruit products in North America. Dean Foods expects initial costs tied to the joint venture to decrease 2009 earnings before special items by about 6 cents a share. The company also expects an additional pension expense of 3 cents a share in 2009 due to market conditions. Net profit rose to $37.8 million, or 24 cents a share, in the third quarter from $6.5 million, or 5 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding reorganization and other costs, the company earned 28 cents a share, missing the analysts' average forecast of 31 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. Sales rose 3 percent to $3.2 billion, helped by acquisition-aided volume growth in the DSD Dairy segment. The company said it had passed lower conventional milk costs on to consumers, as typically happens in the dairy business. Rising organic milk costs and increased marketing spending to stave off competition in the Horizon business helped drive profit down 4.2 percent at the company's WhiteWave-Morningstar segment. Profit rose 21 percent in the traditional dairy business. The company still expects to earn at least $1.20 a share for the full year, excluding items. Analysts on average forecast $1.26, according to Reuters Estimates. Dean Foods said it was aiming for earnings-per-share growth at a mid-teen percentage rate for 2009. Analysts on average forecast $1.59 a share. Even excluding the additional pension costs and joint-venture start-up expense, the company's forecast still implies earnings that may be below Wall Street expectations, analysts said. Dean Foods shares fell $3.65, or 16.5 percent, to $18.51. (Reporting by  Brad Dorfman  and  Aarthi Sivaraman ; Editing by  Derek Caney  and Lisa Von Ahn)
