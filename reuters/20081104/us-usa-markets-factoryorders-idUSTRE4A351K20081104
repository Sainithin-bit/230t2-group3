 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - New orders received by U.S. factories took a surprisingly steep tumble for a second month in a row during September, according to a Commerce Department report on Tuesday underlining an accelerating decline in manufacturing activity as the economy heads into recession. 

 KEY POINTS: * Overall factory orders dropped 2.5 percent to a seasonally adjusted $432 billion - much steeper than the 0.8 percent decline that Wall Street economists had forecast. * That followed a revised 4.3 percent plunge in August orders that previously was reported as a 4 percent decline. * The picture was even grimmer when transportation orders were excluded, with orders down a record 3.7 percent in September after a 3.6 percent August drop. COMMENTS: KURT KARL, CHIEF US ECONOMIST, SWISS RE: "It's a deeply negative report. Overall, this is setting the economy up for a very bleak fourth quarter. Past the election and as some of the help given to the financial system starts to come into effect, we may see some rebound in spending and perhaps in consumer sentiment. But no doubt we are bracing for a weak fourth quarter." PETER KENNY, MANAGING DIRECTOR, KNIGHT EQUITY MARKETS, JERSEY CITY, NJ: "The numbers are truly dismal. Truly dismal, and yet not capable of quelling the excitement of knowing we will have a new president elected today. Dismal as they are, today's momentum is for the upside. The markets may close flat, but we're up 150 points in the face of these very dreary numbers. "I don't think the market will react to them in the coming days either. This data point has been shoved to the rear. It will no longer be the headline news. Now the news will be completely and totally about the recession that we're clearly in and what kind of bright, outside the box thinking will come out of Washington. These numbers are more of the same. The markets starting to look forward; the psychology is shifting to a forward-looking orientation. We know the current economic climate is bad. "It doesn't matter who wins the election; the issues are too large. It will take a Herculean effort from the president, Congress and the American people to deal with them." BRIAN DOLAN, CHIEF CURRENCY STRATEGIST, FOREX.COM, BEDMINSTER, NEW JERSEY: "Factory orders are worse than expected, but no surprises here. The sharp drop to extreme lows in the ISM manufacturing index yesterday foretold weaker factory orders and the new data may not have much of an impact." JOE SALUZZI, CO-MANAGER TRADING, THEMIS TRADING, CHATHAM, NEW JERSEY: "Factory orders weren't great but then again, what can you expect in this type of situation? "Even though they were worse than anticipated, the market didn't seem to budge off of it, which is a good thing when it stops going down on bad news. "I think the election is overriding everything. It seems to be on everybody's mind, so even though any economic number at this point is important, the thing is we have a bigger story." MARKET REACTION: STOCKS: U.S. equity indexes hold gains despite weak data. BONDS: Treasury debt prices stay little changed. DOLLAR: U.S. dollar unchanged versus major rivals.
