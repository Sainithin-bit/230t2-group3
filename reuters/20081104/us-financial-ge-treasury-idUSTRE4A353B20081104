 BOSTON  (Reuters) - General Electric Co ( GE.N ) does not expect the Treasury Department to offer to invest funds from a $700 billion fund to bail out the financial industry in its GE Capital arm, but would listen to a proposal if one were made, a GE spokesman said on Tuesday. 

 "This is not something we expect," said Russell Wilkerson, a spokesman for the U.S. conglomerate. "If it were offered, we would evaluate it." The Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday that the U.S. Treasury was considering investing funds from the $700 billion rescue program in a wide range of companies, including GE Capital and CIT Group ( CIT.N ). GE shares were up 6.6 percent, or $1.27, to $20.57 on the New York Stock Exchange. (Reporting by Scott Malone.)
