 ZHUHAI, China  (Reuters) - China's main aircraft maker has agreed to sell five ARJ21 jets with an option for 20 more to U.S. conglomerate General Electric's ( GE.N ) aircraft leasing arm, in China's first major overseas deal for the aircraft, with an estimated value of around $750 million. 

 China's main aircraft maker, The Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (CACC), signed the deal with GE Commercial Aviation Services on Tuesday at the Zhuhai airshow in south China, they said in a joint statement. GE Commercial preliminary agreed in March with CACC to buy five ARJ21 jets with an option to buy another 20. CACC, which developed the ARJ21, was incorporated earlier this year after the merger of China's two state aircraft makers AVIC I and AVIC II. Orders for the ARJ21 jet, unveiled last December and due for commercial deliveries from the third quarter of 2009, have already exceeded 100, mostly from domestic carriers. General Electric and Parker Hannifin Corp ( PH.N ) are among companies which supply parts for the ARJ21 jet. (Reporting by  James Pomfret ; Writing by Alison Leung; editing by Anne Marie Roantree)
