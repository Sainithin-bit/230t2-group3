 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - A Senate vote on whether to confirm Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke to a second term will likely be "very close," a senior Democratic leadership aide said on Friday. 

 The aide said it remained unclear how many Democrats as well as Republicans will line up for and against Bernanke. "I believe there will be the votes to confirm him, but it's going to be very close," said the aide, requesting not to be identified by name. (Reporting by  Thomas Ferraro , Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)
