 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - U.S. motorcycle maker Harley-Davidson Inc ( HOG.N ) reported a larger-than-expected loss for the final quarter of 2009 on Friday and warned that 2010 would continue to present challenges, sending its shares down 6 percent at midday. 

 Weak consumer spending and tight credit markets created huge headwinds last year for the Milwaukee-based company, which was already dealing with a number of significant issues, including the aging of its key baby-boomer customer base. In response, Harley has undertaken a huge and costly restructuring, consolidating production, laying off thousands of workers, discontinuing its Buell bike lines and putting its MV Agusta unit up for sale. It has also tried to reach beyond its traditional customer base with performance bikes aimed at younger riders, and sought to extend the riding years of aging customers by offering easier-to-handle three-wheeled bikes. But with the current economic recovery looking rocky and uneven, Harley-Davidson, which has seen demand fall for three years in a row, is holding out little hope that 2010 will be any easier. "We expect the global economy to remain challenging with continued high unemployment and low consumer confidence in the United States," John Olin, the company's chief finance officer said during a conference call for analysts. As a result, Harley-Davidson said it now plans to ship between 201,000 and 212,000 motorcycles in 2010 -- down as much as 10 percent from 2009 and down more than 40 percent from the peak in 2006, when the company shipped 349,196 units. "This is going to be a smaller company going forward," said Robin Diedrich, a senior analyst at Edward Jones, which has had a "hold" on the shares for three years. "The market is not going back to the heyday." For the quarter ended December 31, Harley-Davidson posted a net loss of $218.7 million, or 94 cents a share, compared with a year-earlier profit of $77.8 million, or 34 cents a share. Its loss from continuing operations came to 63 cents a share on sales of $764.5 million. On that basis, analysts expected a loss of just 32 cents a share before items, on sales of $764.4 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Chief Executive Officer Keith Wandell said the results reflected the difficult economy as well as the higher-than-expected cost of the restructuring needed to bring production in line with demand. The costly revamp is "critical to restoring greater profitability and long-term growth," Wandell said, and warned that the company would have to spend another $175 million to $195 million in 2010 on the process. Harley's total outlays on the restructuring could reach $460 million into 2012, he added. Revenue from sales of Harley motorcycles to dealers fell 45.6 percent to $552.0 million in the fourth quarter, and shipments fell 53.1 percent. Retail sales of motorcycles to consumers, meanwhile, fell 21.4 percent worldwide during the quarter, led by a 27.9 percent drop in the United States, the company's largest and most lucrative market. Tim Conder, managing director of leisure equity research at Wells Fargo Securities, said Harley's "sell-through was worse than our expectations." In midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Harley shares were last down 6 percent at $24.07 after an earlier drop to $23.16. (Reporting by James B.
