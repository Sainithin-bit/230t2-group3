 BOSTON  (Reuters) - General Electric Co is placing a higher priority on raising its dividend than buying back shares or making acquisitions as it looks toward an anticipated $25 billion cash it expects to be able to redeploy at the end of this year, its chief financial officer said. 

 "We would like to grow the dividend in line with earnings, that's the first priority," Keith Sherin told Reuters in an interview on Friday. "Beyond that, it's going to be opportunistic." The company also expects to pay $2 billion in cash into its GE Capital finance division next year. The largest U.S. conglomerate, which reported quarterly earnings on Friday that topped Wall Street forecasts, is comfortable with its roughly $50 billion level of outstanding commercial paper, down from $72 billion at the end of 2008, Sherin said. GE spent much of the past year cutting its exposure to that market, which briefly locked up in the fall of 2008, threatening the financial stability of many major U.S. companies. "Around $50 (billion) is a very comfortable number for us," Sherin said. "We do not see it going to zero." He also said he expects the pace of mergers and acquisitions to pick up over the coming year. "CEOs and boards are thinking strategically about their future and their capital allocation, and M&A is going to pick back up off of the lows of the last 18 months," Sherin said. "I think that's just true." (Reporting by  Scott Malone ; editing by John Wallace)
