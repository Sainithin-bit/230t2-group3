 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. Democratic Senator Barbara Boxer will vote against Ben Bernanke's confirmation for a second term as Federal Reserve chairman, the Huffington Post reported on Friday. 

 That would make Boxer the third Democrat in as many days to come out against Bernanke, raising new doubts about a nomination that was once expected to sail through.
