 BOSTON  (Reuters) - "Spend it on us," General Electric's shareholders say. 

 The industrial and financial powerhouse expects to have roughly $25 billion of cash on hand at the end of 2010, and investors want at least some of it paid out as dividends or used to buy back shares. GE officials said their first priority will be increasing the company's dividend -- which it slashed by 68 percent in February 2009 -- as well as buying back shares or making small acquisitions. "We always look at bolt-on acquisitions in infrastructure. We think they will be available," Chief Executive Jeff Immelt told investors on a conference call. "We will be very opportunistic on the buyback and look at where the share price is ... And then I think we really see the ability to grow the dividend in line with earnings by 2011." Chief Financial Officer Keith Sherin told Reuters that raising the dividend would be the company's first priority for reallocating the cash surplus, once earnings growth resumes. The company also needs to shift $2 billion into its GE Capital finance arm to cover obligations, a number that is at the low end of its initial estimate of $2 billion to $7 billion. DIVIDEND 'VALIDATION' GE was hard hit by the financial crisis and the brutal worldwide recession that followed, but the Fairfield, Connecticut-based company has remained solidly profitable through the downturn and is on track to generate $6 billion to $8 billion of free cash this year, executives said. They expect to generate another $10 billion from pending unit sales -- mainly the sale of a majority stake in NBC Universal to Comcast Corp. As it grappled with credit losses at its GE Capital finance arm during the downturn, the company held on to its cash or used it to pay down debt. Boosting its quarterly dividend from 10 cents per share could be a big shot in the arm for shareholders, who have watched profit fall for eight straight quarters and seen the stock flirt with 18-year lows last March only to rebound to its current $16.55, investors said. "Certainly, if they raise the dividend a little bit, that will indicate a pretty strong management validation of their position," said Peter Klein, senior portfolio manager at Fifth Third Asset Management in Cleveland. Allan Meyers, a portfolio manager at AMBS Investment Council, agreed. "I obviously would like to see the dividend hiked a little bit," Meyers said. "If they could double that to 20 cents at the end of this year, that would be a positive." But John Dowling, portfolio manager at Golub Group LLC, of San Mateo, California, said he would prefer to see the company focus on buying back its shares, which he considers undervalued. "Why liquidate the company and have investors pay taxes on the dividend when you can do a buyback?" he asked. Portfolios managed by Klein, Meyers and Dowling all contain GE shares. GE officials have also said they want to buy back the $3 billion of preferred shares the company sold to Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. The earliest opportunity to do so will come in 2011. 'BIG DEAL' UNLIKELY One signal company officials sent loudly is that they have no intention of going on an acquisition binge. Immelt said GE would likely find some "bolt-on" deals, but nothing to radically transform the company, which investors currently value at $175 billion. "I just don't see us doing a big deal," Immelt said. "They're going to be reasonable size, from a couple hundred million dollars to a couple billion." Given that GE is in process of slimming down its non-industrial operations, by selling NBC and whittling down GE Capital, Fifth Third's Klein said he would not mind seeing the company spend some of its cash on smaller deals. "We are in a pretty slow growth environment, and if they are changing the mix of their business, why not use this as an opportunity to buy some stuff cheaply?" Klein asked. "Let's not do anything stupid, let's focus on our business and when we're able to include the shareholders in some of this largess." (Editing by Steve Orlofsky)
