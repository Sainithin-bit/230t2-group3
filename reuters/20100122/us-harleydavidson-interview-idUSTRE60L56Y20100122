 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Harley-Davidson's financial chief said on Friday the company's effort to sell MV Agusta, the Italian motorcycle maker it bought less than two years ago, was "on track," with a banker already hired and nondisclosure agreements circulating among several interested parties. 

 In an interview with Reuters, John Olin also said that the ongoing restructuring of Harley-Davidson Inc ( HOG.N ) reflected the new reality of the marketplace, where demand for the heavy, pricey bikes the company produces may have peaked. "The world has changed a bit and we're doing all the right things to manage the business at a lower level," Olin, chief finance officer, told Reuters. "We can be very profitable at lower volumes because we have reduced our break-even point quite significantly." The interview came as the U.S. motorcycle maker reported a larger-than-expected loss for the final quarter of 2009 and warned that 2010 would continue to present challenges, sending its shares down nearly 8 percent on Friday afternoon. Weak consumer spending and tight credit markets created strong headwinds last year for the Milwaukee-based company, which was already dealing with a number of significant issues, including the aging of its key baby-boomer customer base. In response, Harley has undertaken a huge and costly restructuring, consolidating production, laying off thousands of workers, discontinuing its Buell bike lines and putting its MV Agusta unit up for sale. Harley-Davidson now plans to ship between 201,000 and 212,000 motorcycles in 2010 -- down as much as 10 percent from 2009 and down more than 40 percent from the peak in 2006, when the company shipped 349,196 units. Olin said Harley had decided to shut Buell, an American maker of sport bikes, rather than sell it because the company was too enmeshed in the parent's business to be divested. "Basically with Buell it was so highly integrated into the company's processes, into the dealer network, it's really much more of a product line than a separate company," he said. "MV Agusta is completely opposite. It's a completely stand-alone company and much easier to sell as an ongoing entity." Olin said the process of selling MV Augusta, announced this fall, was going well, with a banker hired and several interested parties being asked to sign nondisclosure agreements. "We've made good progress," he said. "We're right on track (with) where we expected to be." Harley purchased MV Agusta, maker of high-performance and lightweight bikes, in the summer of 2008 for $109 million as part of its effort to counter falling sales and expand its presence in Europe. A month after the deal closed, Lehman Brothers failed, world credit markets all but shut down and demand for bikes tumbled, prompting Harley to begin a restructuring effort that the company said Friday will continue through 2012 and could ultimately cost as much as $460 million. Harley shares were down $2.03 or 7.9 percent at $23.55 on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday afternoon. (Reporting by  James Kelleher , editing by Matthew Lewis)
