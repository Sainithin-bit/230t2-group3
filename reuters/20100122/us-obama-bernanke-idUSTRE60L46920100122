 CLEVELAND  (Reuters) - President Barack Obama believes the Senate will confirm Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke for a second term to lead the U.S. central bank, the White House said on Friday. 

 White House spokesman Bill Burton told reporters on Air Force One that Obama had confidence in Bernanke and his actions to help turn the economy around. "(Obama) has a great deal of confidence in what Chairman Bernanke did to bring our economy back from the brink and continues to think that he is the best person for the job and will be confirmed by the United States Senate," Burton said. Bernanke's current four-year term as the head of the U.S. central bank concludes at the end of January. (Reporting by  Alister Bull , editing by Philip Barbara)
