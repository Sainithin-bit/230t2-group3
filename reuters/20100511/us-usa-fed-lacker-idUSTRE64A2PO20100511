 GREENSBORO, North Carolina  (Reuters) - U.S. policy-makers must not wait too long to raise interest rates and must not hesitate even if there is still tension in financial markets, a top Federal Reserve official said on Tuesday. 

 Foreseeing how the European debt crisis will affect of U.S. monetary policy is difficult, as it will depend on what, if any, impact it has on U.S. growth, Richmond Federal Reserve Bank President Jeffrey Lacker told reporters. "We need to be wary of the temptation to hesitate as long as there is some identifiable area of financial fragility in the world," Lacker said after delivering a speech here. Global policymakers this weekend unveiled an emergency rescue package worth around $1 trillion aimed at preventing Greece's debt crisis spreading through the euro zone. Lacker called the package "large and impressive" but cautioned Europe still has to address fundamental fiscal imbalances. The U.S. recovery is gradually picking up steam and employment is on a "path to steady growth", Lacker said. With this backdrop, the U.S. inflation rate is unlikely to stay at recent low levels of below 1 percent, he said. "I believe inflation is unlikely to stay that low," Lacker said. "In fact, the public apparently expects higher inflation in the future, which suggests that policymakers will need to avoid waiting too long to raise rates," he said. Lacker, who is not a voting member of the Fed's policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee this year, is generally seen as one of the more "hawkish" top Fed officials on inflation. He told reporters he sees inflation risks over the next two to three years. The Fed slashed its benchmark interest rate target to near zero in December 2008 and has kept it there since to aid economic recovery after a severe recession. NEED TO THINK ABOUT OFFSETTING SWAPS At its last meeting, the U.S. central bank reiterated its pledge to keep interest rates extraordinarily low for an extended period. Lacker said he was still "marginally comfortable" with that pledge. A Reuters poll on Monday showed most big banks that deal directly with the Fed expect the central bank to keep rates ultra-low until 2011, with some pushing out their forecasts due to the Greek debt crisis. <FED/R> In a move back into crisis management mode, the Fed on Sunday said it was reopening currency swap lines with the European Central Bank and other central banks to ease any liquidity strains from Europe's sovereign debt crisis. Lacker said he did not expect political pushback from the reopening of the program, which it used to funnel dollars to other central banks during the height of the global financial crisis. Some lawmakers have worried currency swaps could expose U.S. taxpayers to losses, but the Fed has said there would be no losses, since its counterparties are central banks that commit to return the funds at the same exchange rate at which they were provided. The lines will again increase the Fed's balance sheet, which more than doubled during the recent global financial crisis. Some analysts have speculated U.S. policymakers may want to offset that monetary expansion. "We are going to have to think about whether we are going to sterilize them," Lacker said, although he said there was a "good chance" there would not be much drawn on the lines. The Fed has a number of ways it could sterilize the swaps, including selling assets from its balance sheet, conducting reverse repurchase agreements with financial institutions or selling more bills from the Supplemental Financing Program.
