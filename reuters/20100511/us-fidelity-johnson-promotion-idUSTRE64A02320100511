 BOSTON  (Reuters) - Abigail Johnson, named to head all distribution channels at Fidelity Investments on Monday, appears to have Fidelity's top job within her grasp if she wants it. 

 Johnson, 48, will report directly to her father, Edward C. "Ned" Johnson III, the chairman and chief executive of the family-controlled company. But so will Ronald O'Hanley, who was recruited from BNY Mellon and put in charge of asset management and corporate services. The move looks likely to pit Johnson and O'Hanley, a veteran of the asset management business, in a two-way battle to succeed Johnson, who turns 80 in June. Fidelity has not enunciated a succession plan. Abigail Pierrepont Johnson has not granted interviews in several years and rarely speaks in public, even though the future of Fidelity would appear to turn on her aspirations. That is in contrast with O'Hanley, who has written articles and editorials on finance-related subjects for top publications, serves as a visiting professor at the University of Edinburgh and is active in the Boston civic community. O'Hanley's public profile resembles that of past Fidelity president Rodger Lawson, known as gregarious while a Prudential Financial executive but then someone who shunned the spotlight after arriving at Fidelity's closely controlled organization. For her part, at her most recent appearance, in Florida in February, Johnson ducked the question of succession in a speech to a trade group, where she appeared to revel in questions about back-office technology solutions. "I like analyzing and managing large-scale transaction processing platforms, record-keeping administration, and brokerage trading services," she said during the talk. Fidelity passed up one chance to promote her when the company's No. 2 executive, president Rodger Lawson, said in January he was stepping down. Still, many analysts have expected that she will ultimately take over, to keep Fidelity's top post in the hands of the family that founded the firm in 1946. Her younger brother, Edward Johnson IV, is an executive in Fidelity's real-estate arm, which was not affected by Monday's reorganization. He has kept an even lower profile than his sister, and the latest moves confirm her greater influence. She co-chairs the board of Fidelity's parent FMR LLC, for instance, while he is only one of its members. Abigail Johnson is ranked among the twenty wealthiest Americans, with a net worth of about $11.5 billion. She earned her business degree at Harvard, became a portfolio manager and worked her way up to run the company's retirement-savings division.
