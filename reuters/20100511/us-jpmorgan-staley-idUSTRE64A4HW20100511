 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Balanced U.S. financial reform will likely prevail, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co's ( JPM.N ) investment bank Chief Executive Jes Staley. 

 U.S. lawmakers are working on a broad overhaul of financial regulation aimed at preventing a repeat of the massive taxpayer bailouts of Wall Street in 2008. JPMorgan has the largest derivatives exposure of the U.S. banks and Chief Executive Jamie Dimon has been outspoken in his concern about some plans to force exchange trading of over-the-counter derivatives instruments. Dimon told bank analysts last month that forcing dealers to trade derivatives on exchanges could cost his firm up to a couple of billion dollars in revenue annually. Staley, speaking at a conference in New York on Tuesday, said he remains concerned about regulations that might prohibit some instruments, although he noted that exchange trading of certain standardized derivatives contracts could lead to a pickup in trading volumes. Separately, the second-largest U.S. bank is comfortable with its exposure to Southern Europe, Staley said. In response to an audience member's question, Staley said JPMorgan is also comfortable with U.S. municipalities' credit and wants to remain an active player in this business.
