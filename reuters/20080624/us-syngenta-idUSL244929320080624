 ZURICH  (Reuters) - Swiss agrochemicals group Syngenta ( SYNN.VX ) and U.S. chemicals maker DuPont ( DD.N ) have signed an agreement to grant each other access to certain crop protection technologies, Syngenta said on Tuesday. 

 Under the agreement the two companies will share the costs to prepare studies for DuPont's new insecticide Cyazypyr and Syngenta will grant DuPont access to its weed killer Callisto. "This agreement gives Syngenta access to new chemistry to develop broad spectrum solutions in the global insecticide market, estimated at around $8 billion," said John Atkin, Chief Operating Officer at Syngenta Crop Protection.
