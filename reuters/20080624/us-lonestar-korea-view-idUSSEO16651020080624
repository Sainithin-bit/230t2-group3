 SEOUL  (Reuters) - A South Korean high court on Tuesday rejected an earlier ruling that found U.S. private equity house Lone Star LS.UL guilty of manipulating the stock price of a former credit card unit to buy it cheaply. 

 The ruling, handed down after a one-week delay, is widely expected to provide a catalyst to the stalled sale of Korea Exchange Bank by Lone Star LS.UL to HSBC ( HSBA.L ) ( 0005.HK ). London-based HSBC last year agreed to buy control of KEB for $6.3 billion, but said early this month that it might consider dropping out of the deal unless regulatory approval was given. Below are comments from analysts on the verdict.  ************************************************************* KOO KYUNG-HWE, HYUNDAI SECURITIES ANALYST "The ruling will make it much easier for HSBC to finalize its proposed deal to invest in KEB, but there is still a lot of uncertainty whether they will go ahead with the deal given that the sector is mired in a global financial squeeze. "In terms of shareholder value, a merger with a local bank would make more sense, as a sale of a controlling stake to HSBC is unlikely to maximize synergy benefits." SHIN KYU-KWANG, ANALYST, SK SECURITIES "This still does not mean that the sale to HSBC will be approved. The financial regulatory agency had previously demonstrated a cautious approach on the matter, and I think it will still take more time for the sale to be cleared." "Some uncertainties may have been removed, which explains the rebound in KEB shares from their earlier fall today." PETER TEBBUTT, DIRECTOR OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, FITCH  RATINGS, HONG KONG "This case isn't the main case. The main case is whether or not Lone Star bought KEB on the cheap in collusion with various government officials. That hasn't been resolved. This is a bit part to the main case. I guess in a way it is a good sign in terms of the main case. It is a bit of a win for Lone Star. It may indicate that the courts are leaning towards their way. Some might say that the courts are being a little more pragmatic about this than the prosecutors. In that sense, it is probably a good omen for the main case, but the main case is yet to be decided. Until that is decided, than I guess the situation remains as is. The exclusive deal between HSBC and Lone Star remains in place for another couple of months. HSBC has made sounds that if things are not resolved soon, it may walk away from that. In terms of whether it helps Korea's reputation with foreign business, it helps a little bit I suppose. All of this with regard to the main case, I think has been quite a bit of damage toward their reputation with foreign investors. I guess this helps rectify it a little bit."
