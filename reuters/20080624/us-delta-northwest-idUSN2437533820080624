 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Pilots at Delta Air Lines ( DAL.N ) and Northwest Airlines NWA.N have reached a tentative labor deal with the carriers on a joint contract that would take effect after the airlines' planned merger, Delta said on Tuesday. 

 The pilots, which are represented by the Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA), also have reached a separate deal among themselves that would establish a single pilot-seniority list, Delta said. The deal must be ratified by union members to take effect. Early merger talks between Delta and Northwest were disrupted by the failure of two pilots groups to come to terms on a seniority deal. Eventually, however, Delta and Northwest decided to proceed with a merger without a plan for pilots integration. "Achieving a joint contract and combined seniority list in advance of the closing of the merger is something that has never been done in this industry and is a testament to the leadership of ALPA and a working together culture," Delta Chief Executive Richard Anderson said in a statement. Delta and Northwest announced their merger plans in April. The deal would create the world's largest airline. (Reporting by Kyle Peterson; Editing by  Gary Hill )
