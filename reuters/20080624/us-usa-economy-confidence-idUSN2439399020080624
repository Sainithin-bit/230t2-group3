 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. consumer confidence fell 
in June to its lowest in 16 years as high inflation continued 
to sap confidence and pushed expectations for the future to a 
record low, the Conference Board said on Tuesday.
   
KEY POINTS: 
* The Conference Board, an industry group, said its inflation 
expectations gauge matched the record-high 7.7 percent it hit 
in May, which will keep Federal Reserve policy makers concerned 
over price growth as they meet to decide rates on Tuesday and 
Wednesday. 
* The Conference Board said its overall monthly measure of 
consumers' mood declined to 50.4 this month -- the lowest since 
47.3 in February 1992 -- from a revised 58.1 in May. May's 
reading was originally reported at 57.2. 
* Economists on Wall Street had been expecting a reading of 
56.4, according to a Reuters poll. Their forecasts ranged from 
50.0 to 60.0. 
COMMENTS: 
ZACH PANDL, ECONOMIST, LEHMAN BROTHERS, NEW YORK: 

 "This is much worse than expected. This is a slight piece 
of negative news for the jobs report this month. This poses 
downside risk on consumer spending once the stimulus from the 
tax rebate passes. "The near-inflation expectations here and the University of 
Michigan survey send a worrying sign, but the Fed will remain 
focus on long-term inflation measures." 
MARKET REACTION: 
* BONDS: U.S. Treasury debt prices extend gains 
* CURRENCIES: U.S. dollar extends losses 
* STOCKS: U.S. equity indexes extend falls, Nasdaq and S&P down 
more than 1 percent 
* RATE FUTURES: Fed fund futures show 70 percent chance of 
August rate hike, down from 74 percent before the data
