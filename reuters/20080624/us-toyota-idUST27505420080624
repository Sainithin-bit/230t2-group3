 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp ( 7203.T ) said on Tuesday that it would be very difficult to hit its annual sales target in the United States, suggesting it would revise down its forecast when it reviews its estimates next month. 

 Toyota said in May that it was adjusting its U.S. sales forecast of 2.64 million vehicles this calendar year, as it scales back production of trucks and deals with an industry-wide slump caused by a sluggish economy and high gas prices. "We have to say that it will be very difficult to hit that target," Executive Vice President Tokuichi Uranishi said at Toyota's annual shareholders' meeting on Tuesday, according to a company spokesperson. Toyota plans to review its sales targets in July, the spokesperson said. (Reporting by Nobuhiro Kubo; Editing by David Cowell)
