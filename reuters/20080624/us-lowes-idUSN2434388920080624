 ATLANTA  (Reuters) - Home improvement retailer Lowe's Cos Inc ( LOW.N ) is looking to take market share in the U.S. housing slump, mainly from independent stores but also from bigger rivals such as Sears Holdings ( SHLD.O ), its chief financial officer said on Tuesday. 

 "In the worst of times, much less capitalized companies are going to struggle to survive in this environment," Lowe's Chief Financial Officer Bob Hull said during a presentation at the Wachovia 18th Annual Nantucket Equity Conference that was broadcast over the Internet. Hull noted that rivals including Home Depot Inc ( HD.N ), the home improvement industry leader, and Rona Inc ( RON.TO ), a Canadian chain, had recently announced store closings. But he said the best opportunity for share gains rests with independent sellers of items such as paint, lighting and hardware. There's continued market share opportunities to be garnered from Sears, Hull said, but "the lion's share of the market is with the independents." Hull also said that North Carolina-based Lowe's saw "no acquisition opportunities" in the United States, adding that any domestic deals would likely face significant antitrust issues. Lowe's reported an 18 percent drop in first-quarter profit last month and cut its full-year profit forecast, citing continued economic uncertainty. Hull also said suppliers were continuing to press for price increases in light of rising fuel and metals costs. Many manufacturers have implemented higher prices lately. Whirlpool Corp, which sells its appliances at Lowe's, told the Reuters Consumer and Retail Summit last week that its price increases were sticking. In May, Lowe's CEO Robert Niblock told Reuters that while Lowe's had raised prices on some products affected by the higher materials costs, it had also expanded a program that cuts prices of other goods. "We are seeing unprecedented requests for price increases," Hull said. Though lower home sales and prices have hurt sales, Hull said Lowe's was taking steps to be prepared when housing improves. For instance, he said Lowe's was testing a selling model under which store workers go to consumers' homes to sell siding, fencing or roofing, and is working on a plan to better handle complex installation jobs such as complete kitchen remodels. Hull also said Lowe's was looking to tweak its store format for smaller cities. About five years ago, the retailer started building smaller 94,000 square-foot stores for some markets. "But we see additional opportunity in even smaller markets and are currently working on a prototype for those locales," Hull said. Lowe's shares were up 38 cents at $22.16 in midday New York Stock Exchange trading, and Home Depot was up 57 cents to $25.63. Sears Holdings was up $1.60 to $75.25 on Nasdaq.
