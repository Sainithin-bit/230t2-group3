 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Scottrade Inc has agreed to pay $950,000 to settle charges that it made misrepresentations to customers regarding the broker-dealer's trade executions. 

 The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said on Tuesday that Scottrade agreed to settle without admitting or denying the charges. A lawyer for Scottrade did not immediately return a call seeking comment. The SEC said St. Louis-based Scottrade from 2001 through 2004 did not conduct a regular and rigorous review of the execution quality of its Nasdaq pre-open orders. The agency said Scottrade then falsely disclosed to customers that it would route orders based on factors including liquidity at market opening when it did not do so. "Without proper disclosure, customers cannot make informed decisions about where they choose to send their orders," Elaine Greenberg, an SEC associate regional director in Philadelphia, said in a statement.
