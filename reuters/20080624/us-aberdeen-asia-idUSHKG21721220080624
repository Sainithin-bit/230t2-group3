 HONG KONG  (Reuters) - Aberdeen Asset Management's ( ADN.L ) Asian division has no current plans to trim its Rio Tinto Holdings ( RIO.AX ) ( RIO.L ) after selling a partial stake to Chinalco and Alcoa ( AA.N ) earlier this year, its top Asia executive said on Tuesday. 

 "They have just negotiated a good price for their iron ore with China ... and Rio is a fantastic company," Hugh Young, managing director of Aberdeen Asset Management Asia, told Reuters. "We are waiting to see what happens really." (Reporting by  Jeffrey Hodgson ; Editing by Anne Marie Roantree)
