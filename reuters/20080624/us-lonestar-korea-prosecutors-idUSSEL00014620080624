 SEOUL  (Reuters) - South Korean prosecutors will appeal the Seoul High Court ruling on Tuesday that cleared U.S. private equity house Lone Star LS.UL of a stock price manipulation charge, a prosecutor said. 

 The Seoul High Court rejected a lower court ruling that found Lone Star and the head of Lone Star's South Korean operations, Paul Yoo, guilty of driving down the share price of KEB's former credit card unit by spreading rumors to allow the bank to buy the unit at below-market prices. But the court handed down a suspended two and a half-year jail term for Yoo on separate charges of negligence of duties in Lone Star's other investment deals in South Korea.
