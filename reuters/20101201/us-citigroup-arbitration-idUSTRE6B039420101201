 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Arbitrators ordered Citigroup Inc ( C.N ) to pay $3 million for a Smith Barney brokerage customer who suffered $70 million of losses after her holdings in Washington Mutual stock were wiped out. 

 Patricia Tynan Chapman in May last year requested $70 million in damages plus punitive damages and other costs related to her investment in Washington Mutual, a bank slammed by collapsing mortgage markets, seized by government regulators and sold off to JPMorgan Chase ( JPM.N ) in September 2008. Chapman asserted the brokerage in January 2008 failed to recommend suitable risk-management strategies and did not warn her about the risks of having such a concentrated position, according to FINRA records on broker Bill Elliott, who at the time worked for Smith Barney. Citi, which sold control of its Smith Barney unit to Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ) last June, denied the allegations. On Monday the FINRA panel ordered Citigroup to pay Chapman $1.5 million and also make a $1.5 million donation on behalf of Chapman to charities of her choosing. As is customary, the FINRA panel does not explain how it arrived at its decision. Washington Mutual shares tumbled through 2007 and 2008 as the collapse of U.S. mortgage markets generated crippling losses. Holders of the common stock, which traded in the mid-$30s per share as 2007 began, were wiped out. Arbitrators also denied Citigroup's request to expunge the matter from broker Elliott's FINRA records. Elliott, according to FINRA records, is a 43-year veteran of the brokerage industry, including 16 years at Smith Barney and its predecessors. He began his career in New York, working for Lehman Brothers, E.F. Hutton, Paine Webber and Dupont Walston. He now works in Salinas, California. The arbitration panel noted that Chapman in October sought sanctions against Citigroup, alleging "repeated and unjustified failure to produce discoverable documents," but that the panel denied the motion.
