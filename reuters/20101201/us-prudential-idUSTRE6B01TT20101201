 LONDON/HONG KONG  (Reuters) - The boss of Britain's biggest insurer Prudential Plc outlined a plan to double Asian premiums by 2013, a move seen as bolstering his grip on the top job after a bungled takeover in the high-growth region. 

 Prudential, facing shareholder pressure after the failed multi-billion-dollar attempt to buy AIA this year, also said it was targeting a doubling of last year's life insurance and asset management pre-tax profits by 2013. "This is a very positive statement and I think that Prudential can deliver," said Shore Capital analyst Eamonn Flanagan, who listened to the company's presentation. Prudential shares were up 5.6 percent to 592 pence at 1126 GMT, among the top gainers in the FTSE 100 index, as analysts said the ambitious targets would lessen calls for chief executive Tidjane Thiam and chairman Harvey McGrath to quit. "They were convincing and I think this should put an end to talk about the CEO or chairman quitting," Flanagan said. Prudential was forced to pull its $35.5-billion bid for AIA -- the Asian life insurance business of stricken U.S. insurer AIG -- in June after shareholders balked at the price. The deal, pulled at the very last minute, left Prudential to pay 337 million pounds in transaction fees. AIA was floated on the Hong Kong stock exchange in October. Prudential's Asian business is seen as the jewel in the 162-year old insurer's crown, generating almost half of group sales and still growing strongly thanks to its exposure to the dynamic economies of southeast Asia. Broker Panmure Gordon said the aim to grow Asian profitability would help close the valuation gap between the implied valuation of Prudential's Asian operation and its competitors, including AIA. "The announcement today is of stretching targets and reinforces the dividend paying capabilities along with adequate capital to grow the business," Panmure Gordon said in a note. Prudential reported 713 million pounds in life insurance and asset management pre-tax operating profit in 2009 and a stronger-than-expected 17 percent rise in third-quarter sales in November, helped by strong growth in its flagship Asian markets.
