 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Starbucks Corp's CEO blasted financial speculators for a "tragic" 50 percent surge in coffee futures this year, recalling the corporate distress heard three years ago when other commodity markets surged. 

 Loud complaints about the impact of pension and hedge funds on commodity prices have subsidized over the past few years as prices of things like oil and grains fell from record highs, and as more studies suggest that such investors can't alone explain the sharp rally in prices. But Starbucks Chief Executive Officer Howard Schultz revived the theme just as U.S. regulators have begun to implement more rules meant to check the ability of big financial players to take large positions in these markets, one of the most contentious aspects of financial regulation overhaul. "I think it's tragic ... that coffee prices are at these levels," Schultz told analysts and investors gathered in New York. "There is no evidence whatsoever that we can see that there's any supply or demand (issue)." "This is financial speculation at its worst," he added. Seattle-based Starbucks, the biggest coffee shop chain in the world, has weathered the price increase by raising the price of its large-sized and labor-intensive drinks. In 2008 and 2009, it closed stores and slashed costs as consumers cut discretionary spending. Arabica coffee futures trading on ICE Futures U.S. soared to a 13-1/2-year high on November 10 at an intraday peak of $2.2145 per lb, up a whopping 60 percent from levels in mid-June when the fund-led rally began. The price is up nearly 50 percent since then end of 2009. Soft commodities like coffee have been a particular focus for funds this year. Cocoa producers in London complained to the LIFFE exchange this summer after prompt prices surged to a 300 pounds-per-tonne premium to the next contract in a major market squeeze. To some, it was a small-scale replay of 2008, when an influx of speculators helped boost the Reuters-Jefferies CRB index of 19 commodities including coffee by 32 percent on the year by July 2008. It then tumbled about 58 percent over then next eight months, as Lehman Brothers collapsed and triggered global financial panic. NOT SO FAST But while strong fund buying has been credited with spurring the recent rise in coffee, analysts say prices stayed high because of strong fundamentals. Colombia, the world's top producer of washed arabica coffee, entered its third consecutive year of low production. "If it has nothing to do with fundamentals, why haven't we seen the market hammered down by producers? We didn't have enough coffee," said Rodrigo Costa, vice-president of Institutional Sales for Newedge USA. Global production is looking good, with official estimates for the 2010/11 crop year ranging from around 133 million to 139.7 million 60-kg bags, compared to about 120 million to 125.7 million bags from the previous crop. The sharp increase is partly due to the natural biennial cycle of production in top grower Brazil. Only a fraction of this global crop, however, trades on ICE Futures U.S. where the benchmark contract is dealt. The beans that are deliverable to ICE are washed arabica, which are a high quality bean grown primarily in the high altitudes of Colombia, Peru, Central America and parts of Africa. Colombia is harvesting a significantly smaller-than-average crop for the third straight year, meaning roasters are having to pay up for this higher quality bean. "There is no shortage of coffee per se but there is high usage of high-quality inventories and the lower production of high quality beans as well," Costa said. "These prices are needed to stimulate more production." (Reporting by  Martinne Geller  and  Marcy Nicholson ; Editing by Phil Berlowitz and  David Gregorio )
