 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs ( GS.N ) sought help from a Federal Reserve program for Wall Street dealers 84 times during the financial crisis, according to data released by the U.S. central bank on Wednesday. 

 The investment bank borrowed as much as $18 billion on October 15, 2008, from the Fed's Primary Dealer Credit Facility, an overnight loan facility that provided funding to primary dealers including investment banks.
