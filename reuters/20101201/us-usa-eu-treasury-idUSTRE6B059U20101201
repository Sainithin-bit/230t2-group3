 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The United States is not discussing an extra commitment of funds for a European stabilization fund right now, a U.S. Treasury Department spokesman said on Wednesday. 

 The official was responding to a Reuters story that quoted an unnamed U.S. official saying the United States would be ready to support an extension of the European Financial Stability Facility through an extra commitment of money from the International Monetary Fund. "An extra commitment is not something we're discussing right now," the Treasury official said. (Reporting by  Glenn Somerville ; Editing by Leslie Adler)
