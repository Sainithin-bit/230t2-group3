 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Richmond Federal Reserve Bank President Jeffrey Lacker said on Tuesday that he sees some "hysteria" and "overreaction" in worries that runaway inflation is around the corner. 

 Lacker said the Fed will eventually have to time the withdrawal of monetary stimulus delicately to avoid rising inflation. "I don't know when that time is coming," he said. But, he added, "we are definitely cognizant of that risk" on the Fed's policy-setting committee, he said. (Reporting by  Kristina Cooke  and  Jonathan Spicer ; Editing by Steve Orlofsky)
