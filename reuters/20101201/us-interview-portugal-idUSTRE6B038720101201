 LISBON  (Reuters) - Europe's anti-crisis mechanisms are not effective and the union has to come up with a joint response to speculative pressures in the debt market, Portugal's Treasury Secretary Carlos Pina said on Wednesday. 

 Pina said the EU needed to "deepen its budget and create a European Treasury" to defend the euro currency, which is hammered by the debt woes of peripheral issuers like Portugal. Portugal is facing increasing market pressure to follow Greece and Ireland in requesting an international bailout, which the country insists it does not need. In a written reply to questions from Reuters after a Treasury bill auction showed Portuguese yields rising sharply, Pina attributed the rise to speculative pressures. "The big lesson we can learn from this is that the European solution mechanisms for the crisis are not being effective. They again demonstrated this week a contrary, penalizing impact on Portuguese, Spanish, Italian and Belgian debt," Pina said. "There is a short-term speculative movement that persists and requires a joint response by the European Union and the euro zone," he said. He did not elaborate further on what form such a response should take. Pina said rumors that Portugal was under pressure to request an aid package after Ireland agreed an 85 billion euro ($113 billion) bailout from the European Union and the International Monetary Fund last weekend were harmful and had to stop. "A bailout never normalizes markets ... Portugal does not need a bailout," Pina said, adding that a strong demand at the T-bill auction showed that Portugal maintains the capacity to finance itself. Many economists fear that unless Portugal takes the same medicine, the contagion will spread to its neighbor Spain, a considerably larger economy. The yield of 5.281 percent at the auction -- a euro lifetime record -- "does not correspond at all to Portugal's risk level, similarly to what happens in other European countries," he said. Pina reiterated the government's commitment to meeting ambitious budget deficit targets this year and next, of 7.3 percent of GDP and 4.6 percent of GDP respectively, designed to soothe investor concerns over Portugal's credit worthiness. Next year's European Union budget has become a battleground between the bloc's 27 governments, forced to pursue austerity at home, and the European Parliament, whose initial demand was for a 6.2 percent increase.
