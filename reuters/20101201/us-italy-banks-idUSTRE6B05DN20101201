 MILAN  (Reuters) - Euro zone sovereign debt concerns may soon put added pressure on the capital adequacy ratios of Italian banks even though analysts say it's too early to raise the red flag on the country's financial system. 

 After an 85 billion-euro bailout for Ireland failed to reassure markets on Sunday attention has shifted to looking at which country might be next to need help. And after Portugal and Spain, some investors are now raising concerns that Italy may also be swept up in the crisis. Italy's effective 10-year borrowing cost on Tuesday rose to 4.75 percent, a year high, and the spread over German bunds rose to a euro life-time high. The eurozone crisis elsewhere has shown just how intertwined the financing problems of banks and governments are. Worries have now turned to Italy where the banks are looking relatively undercapitalized in the context of a notoriously unstable political system, public debt standing at nearly 120 percent of domestic output and the need to refinance 280 billion euros of key government debt next year. Italian lenders, traditionally cautious and able to rely on retail deposits for funding, fared better than many European peers in the financial crisis as they avoided risky subprime bets and did not need emergency government funding. But despite their comparative strength, the threat of risk to Italy's sovereign debt has had an obvious impact on Italian banks and insurers, who are major holders of domestic bonds. "The Italian banks are safer and there's much less earnings risk as they are better funded by customer deposits," said Andrew Lim, analyst at Matrix in London. "But if Italy as a sovereign finds itself in the same sticky situation as Ireland you have the worry about default risk." CAPITAL RATIOS As a result capital adequacy ratios of around 8 percent of assets at major Italian banks now look inadequate compared with some of their European peers and especially those in Switzerland, Britain and the Nordic region. "Regulators are clearly aiming for an increase of capital ratios, which is also the main objective of Basel III, and will continue to pressure banks in this direction," said Giada Giani, an analyst with Citi. "That was, for instance, the solution found for Ireland, an injection of funds to boost ratios. This will likely be the solution for the rest of the system, including Italian banks." European bank shares rallied on Wednesday on speculation the ECB could take decisive steps such as the purchase of government bonds to combat the threat that its debt and banking crisis could spread from Ireland to other countries. But Evolution Securities named Unicredit, Italy's biggest listed bank, as one of Europe's banks most in need of capital, estimating it had a 5 billion-euro ($6.55 billion) capital shortfall. Its equity Tier 1 adequacy ratio is expected to be near 8.4 percent at the end of 2010, broadly in line with the country's second-biggest bank Intesa Sanpaolo, but about half the ratio expected for Credit Suisse and well below that of other banks including HSBC, according to estimates from Keefe, Bruyette and Woods. "In general, capital ratios are not a strength of the larger Italian banks," said Renato Panichi, in charge of Italian financials at credit rating agency Standard and Poor's. "The fundamental strength of Italian banks lies in their funding structure. Banks finance themselves through their retail and corporate network with deposits or bonds and need to go on the wholesale market less often than European peers." DEBT FUNDING Italy will issue 240 billion euros worth of medium and long term bonds next year, according to the head of the Italian treasury's debt department Maria Cannata, slightly below what was issued this year. That would rise to 480 billion euros including short-term treasury bonds. But household indebtedness has remained traditionally low and the country's debt is mainly held by Italian banks and domestic investors, making it less volatile. Spreads on five-year top Italian banks' credit default swaps (CDSs), an insurance against the risk of default, have doubled since the sovereign debt crisis started to intensify in April. Bank of Italy Governor Mario Draghi at the end of October warned that the cost of long-term funding was rising at a time when large volumes of bonds are nearing maturity. The spreads for Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena, which barely made it through a Europe-wide banking stress test in the summer and is seen as a possible candidate for a capital hike, tripled to around 273 basis points on Tuesday. DEPOSITS But Italian banks can rely on a large deposit base to face adversities. Although the growth rate of new deposits fell to 7.3 percent in September from over 10 percent in 2009, deposits in Italy are still growing faster than in the euro zone. They are less exposed than other so-called peripheral euro zone countries like Portugal, Ireland and Greece than northern European rivals. "On international comparison, Italian banks continue to enjoy better funding than the European average, especially in terms of deposits," Intesa Sanpaolo economist Elisa Coletti said in the bank's "Banking Monitor" last week. And contrary to European peers, their use of European Central Bank funding has been limited to 0.8 percent of total banking assets in the first 10 months of the year against a euro zone average of 1.7 percent and over 7 percent in peripheral euro zone countries, data from Intesa Sanpaolo showed.
