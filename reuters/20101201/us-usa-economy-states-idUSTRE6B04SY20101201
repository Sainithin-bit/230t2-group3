 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The recession that began in 2007 may have stopped pummeling the economies of U.S. states, but a report released on Wednesday shows they will remain bruised and bleeding for at least another year. 

 "After two of the most challenging years for state budgets, fiscal 2011 will present a slight improvement over fiscal 2010," the report from the National Governors Association and National Association of State Budget Officers said. Still, states "forecast considerable fiscal stress," they added. Most states began fiscal 2011 on July 1. The housing market collapse, financial crisis and longest and deepest recession since the Great Depression created a unique disaster for most states as tax revenue dried up, demand for social services spiked and credit markets froze. According to the groups, states had to cut general fund spending in both fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2010. "These back-to-back declines, only the second and third time that state general fund spending has declined in the history of this report, also mark the first time in which states have had consecutive years of lower general fund spending," they said. The recession officially ended in the summer of 2009, and recent indicators have shown that states' economies may have stopped their decline. Unemployment rates fell last month in most states, and tax revenue has begun to increase. "Highlighting the slight improvement in fiscal 2011 is (the fact) that 35 states enacted budgets with higher general fund spending compared to fiscal 2010," the report said. It found that spending for this year is forecast at 5.3 percent higher than in fiscal 2010. Still, even as revenue increases this year, collections will likely remain well below 2008 levels, the report said. "States are still facing billions of dollars in gaps going forward," Scott Pattison, executive director of NASBO, told a press conference, adding that collections are 7.8 percent lower than in fiscal 2008. All states except Vermont must by law balance their budgets, and currently 11 are reporting nearly $10 billion in budget gaps that must be closed by the end of fiscal 2011. Twenty-three states say they will have to close deficits of $40.5 billion in drafting their budgets for fiscal 2012. Already, 17 states foresee budget gaps totaling $40.9 billion for fiscal 2013. They will struggle to find places to pare spending after slashing budgets for two years. Since fiscal 2009, they have closed $230 billion in total budget gaps, mostly through spending cuts. In fiscal 2010, states increased taxes and fees to raise a little over $30 billion, and increases for fiscal 2011 have been smaller. They also spent their rainy day funds, which peaked in fiscal 2006 at $69 billion, representing 11.5 percent of general fund expenditures. By the end of fiscal 2010, those reserves fell to $39.2 billion and are expected to drop again in fiscal 2011, to $36.2 billion, or 5.6 percent of general fund spending, according to the report. The amount in reserve may appear large, Pattison said, but "many states are extremely low, close to zero." Oil-rich Alaska and Texas hold two-thirds of the total reserves. One possible avenue for help is debt, Pattison said, especially when it comes to paying for infrastructure. "There's no question in my mind that states are fine in terms of debt," he said, adding they may be limited by state caps on issuance or concerns about affecting their ratings. END OF STIMULUS PLAN NEARS States survived much of the downturn with help from the 2009 federal economic stimulus plan, which provided funds for healthcare, education and infrastructure. Altogether, the U.S. government provided $151 billion in flexible emergency funding to eliminate state budget gaps, according to the report. Stimulus funds increased the federal share of total state budgets to 34.7 percent in fiscal 2010 from 26.3 percent in 2008, the report found. The stimulus plan expires next month and states say their budgets will hurt when the money runs out. "The removal of these funds, when combined with an extremely slow recovery in state revenue collections, could result in severe cuts to state programs and services," the report said. Raymond Scheppach, executive director of the governors group, said states will not ask Congress for continuation of the stimulus programs and will find ways to make do with less. While in the recent past their revenues averaged 6 percent annual growth, most states expect growth to be closer to 3 to 4 percent in the future, he added. (Editing by  James Dalgleish )
