 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - General Motors Co ( GM.N ) said on Tuesday that its GM Daewoo Auto & Technology, Inc. subsidiary will fully repay its Korean revolving credit facility this month. 

 The facility had a drawn balance of $1 billion as of Sept 30, the company said. "Following our successful IPO, we will continue to take opportunities to strengthen our balance sheet," Chief Financial Officer Chris Liddell said in a press release. "Our objective remains to have minimal debt and a fully funded pension plan." (Reporting by  Steve James ; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman)
