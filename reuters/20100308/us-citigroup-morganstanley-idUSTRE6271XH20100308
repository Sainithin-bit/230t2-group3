 (Reuters) - Gary Shedlin, who was most recently chairman of Citigroup's ( C.N ) investment banking effort for financial institutions, focusing on client relationships, is departing to join Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ), Bloomberg said citing a person with knowledge of the matter. 

 Shedlin notified Citigroup of his plans recently, the person told Bloomberg. Shedlin had helped oversee the NYSE Euronext NYX.N merger deal and has also advised the world's biggest money manager, BlackRock Inc ( BLK.N ), for more than a decade, according to the Bloomberg report. Citigroup and Morgan Stanley declined comment to Bloomberg. Both the firms could also not be immediately reached for comment by Reuters outside regular U.S. business hours. Citigroup's financial institutions group continues to be led by David Head, Bloomberg said. (Reporting by  Sakthi Prasad  in Bangalore; Editing by  Anshuman Daga )
