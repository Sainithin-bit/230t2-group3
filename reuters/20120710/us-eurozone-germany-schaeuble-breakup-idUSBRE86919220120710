 KARLSRUHE, Germany  (Reuters) - German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble told the country's Constitutional Court on Tuesday that the euro zone faced a messy breakup if measures were not taken to stabilize the common currency. 
 "The alternative to stabilizing the common currency is a breakup with consequences that are difficult to predict," he said at the end of a day-long court hearing on the euro zone's bailout fund and a new fiscal pact. (Reporting by  Sarah Marsh , editing by Gareth Jones)
