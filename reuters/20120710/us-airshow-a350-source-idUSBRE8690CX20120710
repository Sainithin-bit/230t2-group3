 FARNBOROUGH, England  (Reuters) - European planemaker Airbus will announce a significant order for its widebody, carbon-composite A350 passenger jet at the Farnborough Airshow on Tuesday, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters. 
 "This will be a flagship announcement," the source said. The A350 spans two categories of aircraft, aiming to challenge the Boeing 787 Dreamliner and the U.S. company's most profitable plane, the 777 mini-jumbo. The largest version of the A350 that competes with the 777 has not had a buyer since 2008 and industry sources told Reuters at the weekend that Hong Kong carrier Cathay Pacific, which already has A350s on order, could help Airbus break the drought.
