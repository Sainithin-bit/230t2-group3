 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The Commodity Futures Trading Commission voted unanimously on Tuesday to approve a final rule exempting swaps "end-users" from a requirement that they route their trades through clearinghouses. 
 Small banks with less than $10 billion in assets will also be exempted from the clearing requirement that was included in the 2010 Dodd Frank financial overhaul law. (Reporting By Alexandra Alper; Editing by  Tim Dobbyn )
