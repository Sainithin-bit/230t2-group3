 FARNBOROUGH, England  (Reuters) - Airbus said Bhutan's national airline Drukair has firmed up an order for an Airbus A319 with sharklet fuel-saving wingtip devices. 
 Drukair, which has a fleet of just two A319 aircraft, had signed a memorandum of understanding for the plane in February, Airbus said on Tuesday. (Reporting by  Victoria Bryan ; Editing by Dan Lalor)
