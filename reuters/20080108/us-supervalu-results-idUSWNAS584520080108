 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Supervalu Inc ( SVU.N ) posted higher quarterly profit on Tuesday, helped by lower employee-related costs and other expenses, but said consumer spending would continue to be pressured by inflation. 

 The grocery store chain operator said profit for the fiscal third quarter ended December 1 was $141 million, or 66 cents a share, compared with $113 million, or 54 cents a share, a year earlier. (Reporting by  Brad Dorfman ; Editing by John Wallace)
