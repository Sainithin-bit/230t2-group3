 LAS VEGAS  (Reuters) - Sony Ericsson is planning a big push into North America in 2008 and hopes to move to third place from fourth in the global market in a few years, the company's new president, Hideki Komiyama, said on Monday. 

 The mobile venture of Ericsson ( ERICb.ST ) and Sony Corp ( 6758.T ) has had less success in North America than in other regions but aims to change this by introducing more phone models and selling some of them in North America first. "North America is one of the areas in which we have a market presence that is limited," Komiyama said in an interview with Reuters at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, his first press interview since taking on the new job in November. "Now we're starting to set the ground for future years. We think we're ready to take off," he said. The company's North American president, Najmi Jarwala, said, "Sony Ericsson will be bringing the largest portfolio of products we've ever had to North America in 2008." Sony Ericsson, a seven-year-old company, trails Nokia ( NOK1V.HE ), Samsung Electronics ( 005930.KS ) and Motorola MOT.N in the global mobile phone market.
