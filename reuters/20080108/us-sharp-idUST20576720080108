 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japan's Sharp ( 6753.T ) said on Tuesday it aims for 10 percent profit growth in the year starting in April as it brings forward a planned capacity expansion at its flagship LCD panel plant and drives LCD TV sales in China. 

 Sharp now plans to boost capacity at the western Japan plant by 50 percent by July, compared with its original plan for the ramp-up by the end of the year, and said it is aiming for LCD TV sales of at least 10 million sets in the 2008/09 business year. That would be up from an estimated 9 million this year. In revenue terms, it aims for at least 1 trillion yen ($9.15 billion) in LCD TV sales in 2008/09, up from an 850 billion yen target for the current business year to March. Underscoring the importance of securing enough display panels, rival Matsushita Electric Industrial Co Ltd ( 6752.T ) said it may miss its target of selling 9 million flat TVs in the year to March due in part to tight supplies of LCD panels. Sharp, the world's third-largest LCD TV maker behind Samsung Electronics Co Ltd ( 005930.KS ) and Sony Corp ( 6758.T ), said output capacity at its Kameyama No.2 plant will be raised to 90,000 motherglass sheets a month by July, or to the equivalent of 1.35 million 32-inch panels. Total capacity at the No.1 and 2 plants in Kameyama, two Sharp factories for making large-sized LCD (liquid crystal display) panels, will be equivalent to 1.8 million 32-inch panels per month. "We need to carefully watch the potential impact of the ongoing changes in the global economy on our business ... But we expect substantial demand to be stirred up by the Beijing Olympic Games," Sharp President Mikio Katayama told a news conference. "To properly meet such demand is what we will be doing in the first half (of the year)." Sharp's LCD TV sales in China have already surpassed those in Europe in December, Katayama said. RAMP-UP RACE The Osaka-based consumer electronics maker aims to boost both sales and operating profit by 10 percent in 2008/09, Sharp Corporate Senior Executive Vice President Hiroshi Saji told reporters following the news conference. Based on Sharp's earnings forecasts for this business year, the targeted growth would bring sales to about 3.7 trillion yen and operating profit to 209 billion yen, roughly in line with the consensus of 20 analysts polled by Reuters Estimates. Besides ramping up production to beat steep price falls, Sharp plans to launch advanced LCD TVs that are substantially thinner and consume less electricity than conventional LCD models in 2008/09 to better compete with Samsung and Sony. Earlier on the day, Panasonic maker Matsushita said it may miss its target of selling 5 million plasma TVs and 4 million LCD TVs this business year. "For plasma, slow sales in the first half in the United States were a blow. As for LCD, supplies of panels have been quite tight, and remain tight even today," Matsushita President Fumio Ohtsubo told reporters at an industry gathering. But Ohtsubo said the company generally enjoyed robust demand for audiovisual products as well as home appliances in the year-end shopping season and so far this year. In an effort to mitigate a shortage of panel supplies, Matsushita plans to take a majority stake in IPS Alpha Technology, a joint venture making large LCD panels owned 30 percent by itself, 50 percent by Hitachi Ltd ( 6501.T ) and 15 percent by Toshiba Corp ( 6502.T ). Ohtsubo said Matsushita will shoulder the majority of the cost for a $2.8 billion LCD panel plant that IPS Alpha plans to build by the year ending in March 2010. Sharp is building the world's largest LCD panel plant in Japan, spending a total $3.5 billion. Shares in Sharp closed up 0.5 percent at 1,878 yen, while Matsushita lost 1.1 percent to 2,165 yen. The Tokyo stock market's electrical machinery index .IELEC.T was up 0.2 percent. ($1=109.28 Yen) (Reporting by Kiyoshi Takenaka, Editing by Michael Watson/Rory Channing)
