 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Defense contractor Northrop Grumman Corp ( NOC.N ) is teaming up with Oshkosh Truck Corp ( OSK.N ) in a bid to supply military vehicles in a contract that could be worth billions of dollars, The Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday. 

 Northrop and Oshkosh, which is experienced in making military trucks, are eyeing a contract to replace the Humvees that provide transportation for the Army and Marine Corps, the report said. The U.S. Marine Corps has said it aims to replace around 170,000 Humvees in the U.S. military fleet. Other defense suppliers include Lockheed Martin Corp. ( LMT.N ) and Boeing Co. ( BA.N ).
