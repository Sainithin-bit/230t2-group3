 SINGAPORE  (Reuters) - Singapore Airlines ( SIAL.SI ) said on Tuesday its rejected joint bid with Temasek Holdings TEM.UL for China Eastern ( 0670.HK ) was fair value, though it would continue working with China's third largest carrier. 

 "Singapore Airlines will continue to support the building of a relationship with China Eastern, noting that the airlines are still mutually willing to develop the relationship," the carrier said in a statement. Singapore Airlines reiterated the price it offered represented "full and fair value" for its proposed investment. (Reporting by  Kevin Lim  and Saeed Azhar, editing by Neil Chatterjee)
