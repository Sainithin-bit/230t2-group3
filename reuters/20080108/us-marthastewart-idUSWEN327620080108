 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia Inc ( MSO.N ) Chief Executive Susan Lyne said she is not leaving the women's lifestyle magazine publisher, according to a memo sent to employees on Monday. 

 "I want to address an item that ran in the press while I was away, suggesting I might leave MSLO in the near future. Nothing could be further from my plans," she wrote. "I love this company; more importantly I believe in this company." The New York Post reported on January 2 that Lyne may have been looking to leave the company after her three-year contract was extended by one year, but without a longer term contract in its place.
