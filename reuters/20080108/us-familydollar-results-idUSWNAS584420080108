 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Family Dollar Stores Inc ( FDO.N ) said on Tuesday quarterly profit fell as sales at older stores declined and customers cut their discretionary spending. 

 The discount retailer said profit was $51.9 million, or 37 cents per share, for its fiscal first quarter ended December 1, compared with $54.1 million, or 36 cents per share, in the comparable quarter a year earlier. Profit rose on a per-share basis as the company had fewer shares outstanding in the period. (Reporting by  Aarthi Sivaraman ; editing by John Wallace)
