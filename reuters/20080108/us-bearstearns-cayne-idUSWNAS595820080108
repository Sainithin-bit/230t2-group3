 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Bear Stearns Cos Inc BSC.N leader James Cayne, under fire for the collapse of two hedge funds, will step down as chief executive and hand that role to the company's star investment banker, Alan Schwartz, the company said on Tuesday. 

 Cayne will remain as chairman of the fifth largest U.S. investment bank, which suffered its first loss ever in the fourth quarter because of subprime mortgages. (Reporting by  Tim McLaughlin , editing by Leslie Gevirtz)
