 CAMP DAVID, Maryland  (Reuters) - The United States, France and the European Union on Saturday proposed a series of world summits on the financial crisis, beginning after the November 4 U.S. presidential election. 

 President George W. Bush, French President Nicolas Sarkozy and European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso said after a meeting at the Camp David presidential retreat they agreed to "reach out" to other world leaders next week about the idea of holding a series of summits. "World leaders will be consulted about the idea of a first summit of heads of government to be held in the U.S. soon after the U.S. elections," a joint statement said. That summit would seek to "review progress being made to address the current crisis and to seek agreement on principles of reform needed to avoid a repetition and assure global prosperity in the future," the statement said. "Later summits would be designed to implement agreement on specific steps to be taken to meet those principles," it said. (Reporting by  Tabassum Zakaria ; Editing by  Sandra Maler )
