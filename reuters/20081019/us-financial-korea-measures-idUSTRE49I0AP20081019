 SEOUL  (Reuters) - South Korea said on Sunday it would provide $30 billion liquidity to domestic banks and exporters and offer government guarantees on banks' foreign exchange dealings as part of package aimed at stabilizing financial markets. 

 The north Asian country said it was not considering injecting public funds to take stakes in domestic banks for now but could take such steps and expand deposit guarantees if necessary. The government said it would inject 1 trillion won ($750 million) worth of securities it holds to the Industrial Bank of Korea ( 024110.KS ) to boost the state-invested bank's capital base and boost lending to liquidity-strapped exporters. "The government has decided to join in global coordinated efforts to stabilize financial markets and we'll continue to provide preemptive, decisive and sufficient measures to this end," South Korea's Finance Minister Kang Man-soo told reporters. "We believe providing the government guarantee on banks' foreign exchange dealings is the strongest step to save our foreign exchange reserves and our reserves will be managed more stably in the future with these measures and an expected surplus in current account," Kang said. South Korea has seen its won currency tumble to a 10-year low, foreign exchange reserves drop for the sixth consecutive month, and its stock market hit three-year lows, as the global financial crisis deepens. It said the government guarantee on domestic banks' foreign exchange deals with international banks, which will be in place until June next year, will amount to $100 billion.
