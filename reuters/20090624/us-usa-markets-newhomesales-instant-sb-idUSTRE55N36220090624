 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Sales of newly built U.S. single-family homes slipped slightly in May, according to Commerce Department data, underscoring the fragility of conditions in the hard-hit housing market. 

 KEY POINTS: * The annual sales pace of 342,000 was a 0.6 percent decline from April. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast sales would notch a 360,000 rate. It also remained far below the 509,000 annualized pace of May, 2008. * The median sales price rose to $221,600 from $212,600 in April and was the highest since December, when it was $229,600. COMMENTS: STEVE GOLDMAN, MARKET STRATEGIST, WEEDEN & CO IN GREENWICH, CONNECTICUT: "The data was a little weaker than expected, but that's a double-edged sword if it was higher than expected it would add to the supply. Lower than expected lowers the supply. "Overall I'd say it's a slight disappointment, but we came in oversold and lifted on the durable goods number. I'm not expecting much of a market reaction from this." KATHY LIEN, DIRECTOR OF CURRENCY RESEARCH, GFT FOREX, NEW YORK: "These new home sales numbers are negative and basically question the sustainability of the recovery in the housing market. We've got both sales of units as well as prices declining on an annualized basis which confirms the existing home sale report from yesterday. The key here for the dollar is the data is bearish but everyone is going to be focused on the FOMC rate decision and how much the central bank talks about exit strategies." MARKET REACTION: STOCKS: U.S. stock indexes were flat. BONDS: U.S. Treasury debt prices remained steady. DOLLAR: U.S. dollar was little changed.
