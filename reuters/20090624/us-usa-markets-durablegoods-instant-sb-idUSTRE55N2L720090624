 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - New orders for lasting U.S. manufactured goods rose by a much stronger-than-expected 1.8 percent in May, Commerce Department data on Wednesday showed, providing further evidence that the battered U.S. economy was finding its feet. 

 KEY POINTS: * Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast durable goods orders would decline 0.6 percent last month, after a revised 1.8 percent gain in April. * April was previously reported as a 1.7 percent rise. May's increase was the third gain in durable goods orders in 4 months. COMMENTS: KEITH HEMBRE, CHIEF ECONOMIST, FIRST AMERICAN FUNDS, MINNEAPOLIS: "It's certainly a better number than expected. A second sequential monthly gain. But the magnitude is again pretty small, relative to the magnitude of the losses in prior months. There's a big contribution in civilian aircraft orders which seems unlikely to be sustained given the ongoing weakness in the airline industries. "If you look at unfilled orders, they continue to contract. The inventory to shipment ratio stood at 1.9 times in May. It was 1.88 in April, 1.89 in March, 1.89 in January. So there's been a bit of a plateau in the ratio. The pre-recession level was 1.5. "Basically what this is saying is that inventories relative to sales continue to be high. They are not continuing to increase, which would lead you to believe further production cuts are in order, but based on some of the orders data that we saw in leading indicators, they are not improving either. We're going to need to see sales pick up probably somewhat substantially or the improving trend in production indicators is likely to stall. "The numbers point to a stabilization, but certainly not a robust recovery." KIM RUPERT, MANAGING DIRECTOR OF GLOBAL FIXED INCOME ANALYSIS, ACTION ECONOMICS LLC, SAN FRANCISCO: "The headline was certainly better than most people expected. We were looking for a decline in orders given the weakness we've seen in other manufacturing data and given the shutdowns, the bankruptcies of Chrysler and GM. "The durables data are pretty volatile, and the trade immediately after the numbers isn't necessarily sustained. The market is waiting for the FOMC statement today, and that will give us more directional clues than today's durables. But the numbers do add to our expectation that rates are generally headed higher. The economy is bottoming here, and we're looking for the Fed to maybe change its statement slightly and maybe start to suggest a more neutral balance of risk. A nod, basically, to an exit strategy. BRIAN KIM, CURRENCY STRATEGIST, UBS, STAMFORD, CONNECTICUT: "Definitely a big surprise for the market and we're seeing dollar selling across the board except against the yen. The data is another positive sign for the U.S. economy and people may be revisiting the 'green shoots' theory once again. This number has definitely raised some eyebrows and is much stronger than what the ISM has indicated." JOHN SPINELLO, TREASURY BOND STRATEGIST, JEFFERIES & CO. NEW YORK, NEW YORK: "It was surprising, that's three out of four months that we've had significant upward movement in durable goods. Inventories are probably low, orders are increasing and that's probably a good sign for the manufacturing sector. Ex-transport was also a surprise on the upside, so the market took a hit but not too significant. "Durable goods are usually a very volatile series, and we did get a revision last month down half of what the gain showed, so I expect the market will still focus on the supply we have today and the Fed decision on rates. "We expected the market to back up a little into this supply, given the rally we've had in the last few days, and also the caution with which the auction will be bid given that the Fed will be announcing its decision post-auction. This is a good catalyst for backup in the market, and we'll see what new home sales bring. It'll probably be somewhat quiet before the auction, maybe an hour or two before you'll get some more setup and selling in front of the auction, I know the market got burned a little yesterday on the strong two-year note but the 5-year is a different animal -- less of a safe-haven bid, less of a comfortable bid for the foreigners." RICHARD DEKASER, PRESIDENT, WOODLEY PARK RESEARCH, WASHINGTON: "We are clearly seeing persistent weakness in the vehicle sector but that has been offset by aircraft orders and a smattering of capital goods areas like computers and machineries. It implies business confidence is improving somewhat but still at a very abysmal level. And we still have bloated inventories. "In terms of second quarter GDP, the news is less encouraging. We are still guaranteed to have a huge decline in equipment expenditures. If orders continue to rebound, we could see things improving later this year." DAN GREENHAUS, ANALYST AT MILLER TABAK & CO IN NEW YORK "Clearly much better than expected. In addition to the headline beats, the non-defense ex-aircraft measure rose 4.8 percent, which is considerably stronger than where it had been running in recent months. Since that's our proxy for business spending, it bodes very well for going forward." MARKET REACTION: STOCKS: U.S. stock indexes rallied. BONDS: U.S. Treasury debt prices sold off. DOLLAR: U.S. dollar rose against the yen, fell against the euro.
