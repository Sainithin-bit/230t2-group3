 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Lennar Corp ( LEN.N ), the third-largest U.S. homebuilder, on Tuesday posted lower quarterly orders, signaling continued weakness in the housing market. 

 Shares of the homebuilder fell as much as 5 percent as it said the important spring selling season was not shaping up into a recovery from the five-year housing slump, while other data showed home prices continuing to fall. As the housing slump approaches its fifth anniversary, homebuilders continue to struggle with a heavy overhang of used homes and foreclosures that tempt buyers with more affordable prices. "The long-awaited spring selling season of 2011 has not yet defined itself as the beginning of a recovery cycle," Chief Executive Officer Stuart Miller said of the closely watched selling period that began in early February. Traffic from prospective buyers has been more of a "head fake" than the start of a clear upward trend, he said during a conference call with analysts. Lennar's revenue fell 3 percent to $558 million while orders dropped 12 percent to 2,267 homes, missing Wall Street's consensus expectation by 13.7 percent, said FBN Securities analyst Joel Locker. Orders are a leading indicator for homebuilders, who do not book revenue until they close on a house. Industrywide, U.S. single-family home prices fell for the seventh straight month in January, according to data released on Tuesday. The Miami-based builder, which has operations in 14 states including most of the East Coast, Texas and California, said it made a first-quarter profit of $27.4 million, or 14 cents a share, compared with a net loss of $6.5 million, or 4 cents a share, a year ago. Earnings were boosted by a legal settlement and other one-time gains. Analysts on average were expecting a loss of 5 cents a share on revenue of $507.9 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, but it was not clear if the numbers were comparable due to the many one-time items. The company said its distressed land investment and development arm, Rialto, generated $11 million in operating earnings and called it a "bright spot." "Rialto did well, but the homebuilding operations look much like other builders'," wrote Ticonderoga Securities analyst Stephen East in a research note. The company lost $25 million from homebuilding, more than East's expectation of a $15 million loss. As a result of the weak orders, Lennar will probably have to use more incentives -- such as upgraded features or cash gifts to buyers -- to move homes they have built in anticipation of more demand, Locker said. "The housing market is still dismal," he said. In the first quarter, Lennar offered $33,100 in incentives per home, or 12.1 percent of home sales revenue, about flat with last year. Even at this late date in the downturn, sales and prices of new homes were still falling. Last week, the Commerce Department said new home sales fell 16.9 percent, putting the annual rate of 250,000 units at the lowest since records began in 1963. Homebuilders sold 1.3 million homes in 2005, the peak year for new home sales. Lennar's shares fell as low as $18.76, before trading down 3.8 percent at $19 on the New York Stock Exchange at mid-afternoon. Homebuilders as a group were down 1.42 percent, according to the Dow Jones U.S. Home Construction Index .DJUSHB.
