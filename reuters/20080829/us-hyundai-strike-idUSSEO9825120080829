 SEOUL  (Reuters) - Unionized workers at Hyundai Motor Co ( 005380.KS ), South Korea's top automaker, said on Friday they had decided to hold brief work stoppages twice next week over a wage dispute and working conditions. 

 Hyundai's daytime and night shift union members plan to stage four-hour strikes each on Tuesday and Wednesday, if they fail to reach a deal, a union spokesman said. The union has held seven work stoppages since July 2, costing the company 25,819 vehicles in lost output, according to the company. But union members at the company usually make up production losses with overtime work once they reach wage deals. Shares in Hyundai rose 0.42 percent to 71,100 won as of 0538 GMT, compared with a 0.14 percent gain in the wider market  .KS11 . (Reporting by Cheon Jong-woo; Editing by  Ken Wills )
