 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - J.C. Penney Co Inc slashed its forecast for the crucial holiday selling season on Thursday after the department store operator posted a 9 percent drop in quarterly profit, citing "dramatically" weaker sales in September and October. 

 The results are the latest indication that the holiday season will be a tough one for U.S. retailers as consumers clamp down on spending in the face of a weaker housing market, high food and fuel costs, and uncertainty over their jobs. Penney now expects fourth-quarter earnings of $1.65 to $1.80 per share, down from its previous view of $2.41 per share. It also expects fourth-quarter same-store sales at its department stores to be flat to up slightly. The mid-tier department store operator said poor third-quarter sales left it with excess merchandise that it will now have to mark down, hurting its margins and setting the stage for a discount-driven Christmas season. "We expect that promotional activity will increase across retail due to the higher inventory levels that resulted from soft third-quarter sales," said CFO Robert Cavanaugh on a call with analysts. Shares fell 4 percent to $44.81 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Penney said net income fell to $261 million, or $1.17 per share, for the third quarter ended November 3 from $287 million, or $1.26 per share, a year earlier. Excluding a benefit of 14 cents per share, earnings were $1.03, while analysts on average were expecting the company to earn $1.01 per share, according to Reuters Estimates. The U.S. housing market slowdown, high energy prices and uncertain credit market have taken a toll on Penney's predominately middle-income shoppers. In October, Penney cut its third-quarter profit forecast to a range of $1 to $1.04 per share from $1.28. SALES WOES While its shoppers loaded up on back-to-school items in August, they paused for the rest of the quarter, delaying purchases in the face of a shaky economic environment and unseasonably warm weather. "Coming into September, we had every anticipation that we would get off a strong start for the fall season. Obviously that was not the case," said CEO Mike Ullman. "For the first time we really saw change in consumer sentiment reflecting the soft housing market, the sub-prime market and the ...psychological effect at least of fuel prices." Penney's total quarterly sales fell 1.1 percent to $4.73 billion while sales at department stores open at least a year, a key retail gauge known as same-store sales, fell 3.5 percent. In its stores, sales were strongest in women's apparel, fine jewelry and family shoes, but weakest in children's apparel and big-ticket home items. Sales in all regions of the country were below expectations, it said. Gross margins fell 180 basis points to 39.7 percent of sales after the retailer cut prices to try to clear unsold merchandise from its stores and its inventory level is now higher than expected. "There will continue to be pressure on gross margin rates as we work through inventory levels," Cavanaugh said. Penney said it is taking a cautious approach to planning business in the fourth quarter and 2008. (Reporting by Nicole Maestri; editing by  Mark Porter  and Dave Zimmerman)
