 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - General Motors Corp's ( GM.N ) sport utility vehicle, the Chevrolet Tahoe Hybrid, was named "Green Car of the Year" at the Los Angeles Auto Show on Thursday. 

 The Tahoe Hybrid represents the first model from GM to use a hybrid system the automaker developed jointly with BMW ( BMWG.DE ), Daimler's ( DAIGn.DE ) Mercedes-Benz, and Chrysler. "They've proven that they can make beautiful cars, strong cars, keep the size, keep the safety, and all those kinds of things, and at the same time be more fuel efficient," said California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, who toured the show after the presentation of the award. "I think because we in California have been out there so strong, forcing the manufacturers to come in with clean vehicles, that is why they are coming in with clean vehicles." The "Green Car of the Year" award is presented by the trade magazine Green Car Journal, based in California. (Reporting by  Kevin Krolicki , writing by Mary Milliken, editing by Phil Berlowitz)
