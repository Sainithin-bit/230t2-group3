 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Applied Materials Inc ( AMAT.O ), the largest supplier of tools for making microchips, gave a profit forecast far below Wall Street expectations, stirring concerns about holiday-season sales and sending its shares down 5 percent. 

 The estimate came after Applied Materials reported on Wednesday a 6 percent drop in net income, matching a similar drop in revenue, for its fiscal fourth quarter ended October 28, amid a cyclical industry downturn. Chief Executive Mike Splinter said he expected a continued pullback in spending on dynamic random access memory (DRAM), used in personal computers, but ongoing strength in flash memory, found in many consumer electronic devices, would help. "We see the first part of fiscal 2008 as challenging," Splinter said on a conference call. "We expect foundries will remain cautious until their demand picture regains clarity." Applied Materials' results and outlook come amid uncertainty on Wall Street about how much the U.S. credit crisis would hurt demand for technology products and services. Tech shares tanked last week after Cisco Systems Inc ( CSCO.O ) reported dramatic decreases in orders from U.S. banks. But tech shares snapped their losing streak on Tuesday as investors hunted for bargains as the end-of-year holiday season -- the busiest for consumer electronics sales -- approached. Applied Materials saw the current quarter's profit at between 16 cents and 20 cents per share, with revenue falling a sequential 13 percent to 18 percent from the fourth quarter. Wall Street analysts, on average, were looking for a first-quarter profit excluding items of 27 cents, and roughly flat revenue of $2.32 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. Stifel Nicolaus & Co analyst Patrick Ho had expected the company to forecast a decline, but not such a steep one. "I think it is kind of a fluid environment right now. Clearly I think chipmakers are siding on the caution," he said. "There is a lot of uncertainty now." GET THROUGH THE HOLIDAYS Fourth-quarter net income fell to $422 million, or 30 cents per share, from $449 million, or 30 cents per share, a year earlier. Net sales declined 6 percent to $2.37 billion, roughly in line with Wall Street expectations and with the company's own forecasts issued in August. Profit excluding some special items such as items related to acquisitions, but including stock-based compensation expenses, was 31 cents per share, beating the average analyst forecast of 29 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. The results were quickly overshadowed by the company's outlook, which sent its shares down 91 cents, or 4.8 percent, to $17.90 in after-hours trading. "All of our customers sell into consumer markets," Chief Financial Officer George Davis told Reuters in an interview. "It's really a function of 'Let's get through the holidays and see how things look when we are into January.'" Semiconductor production is undergoing a cyclical downturn in capital spending that has even affected Applied Materials, the industry bellwether. Deutsche Bank projects a 15 percent decline in investments in new plants and tools in 2008. CEO Splinter said he expected capital spending by the semiconductor industry to fall 5 percent to 15 percent. The memory business accounted for 67 percent of Applied Materials' orders and was falling, he said. The display business was seen recovering, with industry spending expected to rise 20 percent in the year, but Applied would not see a boost to revenue until its second quarter, Splinter said. The stock has fallen more than 11 percent in the last three months, similar to rival Lam Research Corp ( LRCX.O ) but compared with a 1 percent rise for Novellus Systems Inc NVLS.O.
