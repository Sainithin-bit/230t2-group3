 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Tyco Electronics Ltd ( TEL.N ), a maker of components for cars, aerospace and industrial uses, posted a quarterly profit on Thursday that exceeded Wall Street estimates as it continued a restructuring. 

 Net income fell to $256 million, or 51 cents per share, in its fourth quarter ended September 28, from $369 million, or 74 cents per share, a year earlier. The company earned 59 cents from continuing operations, excluding restructuring and other one-time items. Analysts, on average, expected profit of 54 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Net sales rose 11 percent to $3.62 billion. Analysts expected $3.42 billion. Tyco Electronics, spun off earlier this year from former parent Tyco International Ltd ( TYC.N ), reported restructuring and separation-related costs of $79 million. Excluding restructuring and other items, Tyco Electronics expects to earn $2.40 to $2.50 per share from continuing operations in 2008, up from $2.18 per share in 2007. Analysts expect $2.35. In its first quarter, Tyco Electronics forecast earnings per share of 56 cents to 58 cents, excluding restructuring and separation costs, up from 50 cents per share, a year earlier. Analysts target 54 cents per share. The company sees sales growth of 14 percent to 16 percent in the first quarter versus $3.1 billion a year earlier. Analysts look for $3.35 billion.
