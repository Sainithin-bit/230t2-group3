 SYDNEY  (Reuters) - BHP Billiton's ( BHP.AX ) chief executive Marius Kloppers is likely to get a lukewarm reception at best when he heads for China next week to promote his merger plans with rival Rio Tinto ( RIO.AX ) to BHP's most important customers. 

 While some buyers in the region who rely on both companies for millions of tonnes of iron ore, copper and other commodities may cheer the prospect of a more streamlined supply chain promised by Kloppers, concerns over having one mega-miner setting prices will be daunting. China already takes half of all the iron ore BHP ( BLT.L ) mines, but balances this with orders from Rio, as well as Brazil's CVRD ( VALE5.SA ) ( RIO.N ) and smaller miners in India and elsewhere. China's mighty steel-making industry, the world's biggest, routinely battles BHP over freight rates for iron ore during annual price negotiations. Rio, at the same table, has not pushed this issue. Much of the copper both companies dig in partnership from the massive Escondida lode in Chile also finds its way to China. Kloppers, who was in London when BHP made its proposed three-for-one offer public last week, is expected to head to Japan, Korea and China next week, then maybe South Africa, sources familiar with the matter say. His decision to visit Japan and Korea before China could potentially raise eyebrows in the Chinese steel industry, which feels that as the world's largest it should have first place at the negotiating table. Kloppers' second-in-command, Chief Financial Officer Alex Vanselow, is scheduled to return to Melbourne on Thursday night for more meetings after three days of presentations in Sydney, trying to persuade shareholders to back the deal. The pitch won't have been made any easier by a UBS report on Wednesday that suggested BHP could afford to top up its all-share bid with $27 billion in cash, or an extra A$24 for each Rio share. UBS and its affiliates hold a 5 percent stake in Rio Tinto, according to a notice filed with the Australian Stock Exchange on Thursday. Some BHP executives are being dispatched to the United States and others to Europe next week to continue talks with shareholders and customers there, the sources said. Meanwhile, Rio Tinto CEO Tom Albanese is busy working Rio's policy of non-engagement with BHP from London, instead meeting with key shareholders, many of whom also own BHP stock. "You can assume there is a reasonably comprehensive shareholder communication program going on," one source told Reuters. "Rio shareholders are very happy with the situation. You can see where the share price is relative to the BHP offer." Rio's shares are trading 9 percent above the implied price of BHP's offer and more than 20 percent higher than just before the approach was confirmed. Kloppers expressed confidence this week to journalists and analysts that Rio's board will eventually meet with BHP, although he also said he was bracing for a long wait. Indeed, even if the deal was brokered today, Kloppers believes it will take up to a year to weave through anti-competitive issues arising on almost every continent.
