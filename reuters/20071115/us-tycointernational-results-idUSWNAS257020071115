 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Tyco International Ltd ( TYC.N ) reported better-than-expected quarterly profit on Thursday, helped by demand from energy and water markets, but a disappointing 2008 profit forecast sent shares down as much as 4.7 percent. 

 Tyco said its biggest unit by sales, ADT Worldwide, posted lower profit margins in its European operations, and said those "headwinds" will continue in 2008. But it said a restructuring would begin to pay off in the second half of the year at the unit, which provides electronic security systems. "There's a little disappointment that (ADT is) still struggling in Europe, because I was prepared to hear about more of an impact from North American construction slowing," said Mike McGarr, an analyst with Oregon-based Becker Capital Management, which owns about 500,000 Tyco shares. Tyco forecast fiscal 2008 earnings of $2.50 to $2.65 per share, excluding special items, and expects 2008 sales from existing businesses to rise 4 percent to 6 percent. Analysts were estimating 2008 earnings of $2.61 per share on sales of $20.1 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. Those earnings estimates will likely come down, Becker Capital's McGarr said. Tyco Chief Executive Ed Breen said the company was closely watching the U.S. and global economies, but saw little evidence of pressure on U.S. consumers. Tyco said growth rates in nonresidential construction are moderating, but international demand remains strong. "We continue to see strong growth in international markets in 2008, (and) see continued strength in infrastructure spending in Europe and Asia, primarily in our flow control business," Breen said on a conference call with analysts. "In ADT, there are some signs of project delays in the retail space, but we believe these are delays not cancellations," Breen said. NET INCOME FALLS The company's exit from some businesses drove net income down 85 percent in the latest quarter. Tyco reported net earnings of $181 million, or 36 cents per share, for its fiscal fourth quarter ended September 28. A year earlier, when it benefited from income from discontinued operations, net profit was $1.25 billion, or $2.45 per share. Earnings from continuing operations were 57 cents per share, excluding costs from Tyco's restructuring and break-up. Analysts, on average, had expected 55 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue from continuing operations rose 9 percent to $5.03 billion, compared with the Wall Street target of $4.93 billion. Each of Tyco's five segments posted higher quarterly sales, led by the flow control unit. Sales there jumped 23 percent, reflecting demand from energy and water industries. Other divisions reported single-digit increases, including a 6 percent rise at ADT. Two of five segments -- flow control and safety products -- posted higher operating margins before special items. The company continues to show progress, J.P. Morgan analyst Stephen Tusa said. "Positives were solid organic growth and free cash flow, while the lone negative was the margin at ADT, which was modestly disappointing. We think these factors net out positive, mostly because of management's ability to deliver on free cash flow," Tusa in a research note. CEO Breen said Tyco was looking at some "bolt-on acquisitions," but mergers are not the top priority. "Our number one priority is growth initiatives internally in the company," he said. "We're sitting on a lot of opportunities to gain market share," Breen said, adding that Tyco's No. 2 priority was to complete its restructuring and improve productivity. Earlier this year, Tyco completed the spin-off of its electronics and health-care divisions into separate publicly traded companies. Tyco Electronics Ltd ( TEL.N ) is set to report results after Thursday's closing bell. Covidien Ltd ( COV.N ), the health-care company, will report next month. Tyco shares were down 46 cents to $38.86 on the New York Stock Exchange after earlier reaching a 52-week low of $37.46. (Reporting by Nick Zieminski; Editing by Steve Orlofsky/Jeffrey Benkoe)
