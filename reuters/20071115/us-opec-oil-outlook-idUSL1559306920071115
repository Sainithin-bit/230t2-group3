 LONDON  (Reuters) - OPEC said on Thursday it sees a modest downturn in the U.S. economy in the fourth quarter due in part to record high oil prices, but booming growth in China and the Middle East will keep world oil demand strong. 

 OPEC, in its November Monthly Oil Market Report, lowered its world oil demand growth forecast for the fourth quarter by 100,000 barrels per day to 1.7 million bpd. The group's first quarter growth projection was unchanged at 1.5 million bpd. "The strong (U.S.) economic performance in the third quarter is not expected to be repeated in the last quarter of the year," the report said. "The U.S. consumer is facing headwinds from falling house prices, restrictions on borrowing and higher energy costs." The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries meets on December 5 in Abu Dhabi to chart oil output strategy amid consumer calls for an increase in production. Oil hit a record of $98.62 a barrel last week, but has since pulled back to just below $94. OPEC expects slightly tighter world oil stocks through the first quarter of next year. It saw days of forward consumption declining from an estimated 52.8 days in the third quarter of this year to 51.3 days in the fourth quarter and 52.5 days in the first three months of next year. "While lower, it is difficult to see how these figures represent a sign of an alarming tightness in the market," the report said. OPEC agreed in September to boost supplies by 500,000 bpd from November 1 to soothe concerns over supply tightness. But consumers, led by the International Energy Agency, insist the move was too little, too late. OPEC blames oil's rally on an influx of financial funds into oil markets and weakness in the dollar. "The widespread perception of current market tightness and fear of future shortages appear to be fuelling increasing speculation in the futures market," OPEC said. "Speculative activity has grown dramatically since the middle of August." OPEC also raised the requirement for its oil in the fourth quarter by 190,000 bpd to 31.62 million bpd, and by 180,000 bpd in the first quarter of 2008 to 31.35 million bpd. Citing secondary sources, OPEC said supplies from top exporter Saudi Arabia had risen a "significant" 110,000 bpd in October to 8.73 million bpd.
