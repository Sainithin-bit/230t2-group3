 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Starbucks Corp on Thursday reported that for the first quarter in its history, the number of customer visits to its established U.S. stores fell, and its shares tumbled nearly 9 percent lower. 

 The world's biggest coffee shop chain reported a 35 percent rise in fourth-quarter earnings, but cited weak consumer spending for its forecasts of 2008 earnings below many Wall Street estimates and of 2008 sales at stores open at least 13 months at the low end of its long-term targeted range. "We're seeing this pushback that other retailers have described," Chief Executive Jim Donald said in an interview, adding that a July price increase of about 9 cents a cup had also hurt traffic. That move came less than a year after the company's previous price hike. After years of saying its perpetually growing number of stores was resistant to blips in the U.S. economy, Starbucks in recent months has tempered that message as customers have cut back on visits to the chain. Worldwide, sales at coffee shops open at least 13 months, or same-store sales, rose 4 percent during the quarter, helped by the July price increase. In the United States, same-store sales also rose 4 percent -- but traffic was down 1 percent. "This frankly proves there are no sacred cows in the retail world right now," William Blair restaurant analyst Sharon Zackfia said of Starbucks' results. Net income for the fiscal fourth quarter rose to $158.5 million, or 21 cents per share, compared with $117.3 million, or 15 cents per share, a year ago. The earnings met Wall Street analysts' average expectation of 21 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. In the fourth quarter, total revenue rose 22 percent to $2.44 billion, a little above analysts' average expectation of revenue of $2.42 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. For fiscal 2008, Starbucks said it would open 2,500 stores -- down from its previous target of 2,600. Donald said, however, that the company was still on track to open 10,000 stores in the next four years. In addition, the Seattle company said it expected 2008 same-store sales to rise between 3 percent and 5 percent. That marked a shift from recent years, in which Starbucks had set a long-term same-store sales growth goal of 3 percent to 7 percent. Donald said that because Starbucks has grown so large, it was appropriate to tweak its same-store sales targets. "A company our size, plus the environment and the economic conditions that we're in -- it's a good number," Donald said. Earnings per share for the year are expected to be between $1.02 per share and $1.05 per share. Analysts were expecting earnings of $1.05 per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Donald said the company's 2008 sales and earnings forecasts did not factor in any price increase. Starbucks shares fell below $22.00, or 8.8 percent, in extended trade after closing at $24.10 Thursday on Nasdaq. The stock has fallen more than 30 percent this year on investor fears about slowing same-store sales growth, increased U.S. competition and soaring dairy prices.
