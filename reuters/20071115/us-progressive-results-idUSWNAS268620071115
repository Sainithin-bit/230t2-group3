 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Progressive Corp ( PGR.N ), the third-largest auto insurer in the United States, said on Thursday that net income for October fell 42 percent compared with the same month last year, as premium revenue declined. 

 The auto insurer said October net income was $75.5 million, or 11 cents a share, down from $130.1 million, or 17 cents a share, in October 2006. Net premiums earned, a measure of premium revenue, fell 3 percent to $ 1.32 billion, while net premiums written fell 4 percent to $1.26 billion.
