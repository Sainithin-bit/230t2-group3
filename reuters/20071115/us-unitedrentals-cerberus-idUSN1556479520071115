 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Cerberus Capital Management said it tried to renegotiate its $4 billion buyout of United Rentals Inc due to concerns about the debt market, but the company was unwilling to discuss new terms. 

 Cerberus' statement late last night appears to set the stage for a potential ugly stand-off between the two parties, not unlike the legal battle brewing between Sallie Mae and the J.C. Flowers-led buyout group. Lawyers interviewed on Thursday said that, while both sides have valid points, the most United Rentals is likely to get from Cerberus is a break-up fee or a lower offer. RAM Holdings Inc, Cerberus' acquisition vehicle for the deal, said in the statement that its liability was limited to the $100 million break-up fee. The firm says it agreed with United Rentals to pay a higher price for the company so it would be able to pay the fee and walk away under certain conditions. The statement came hours after United Rentals issued a release saying Cerberus was backing out of the $34.50 per share offer. The release followed a Reuters report earlier in the day that Cerberus was poised to pull the offer, sending United Rentals shares down nearly 30 percent on Wednesday. But the buyout firm's reasoning seems to fly in the face of what the company thought was a done deal. The equipment rental company said Cerberus' rejection of the deal was "unwarranted and incompatible with the covenants of the merger agreement." A source close to the matter said the board is not considering cutting the deal price. What has made the collapsed deal such a hot topic on Wall Street is that its failure does not involve the buyer citing a material adverse change (MAC) in the company's business. When the private equity buyers walked away from the $8 billion buyout of Harman International Industries Inc, the firms cited a MAC as the reason. Indeed, Harman's financial outlook dropped dramatically and the two sides were able to work out a compromise without a messy legal battle. In the $25 billion leveraged buyout of student lender Sallie Mae, formally known as SLM Corp, the two sides are disputing whether a MAC occurred. The case is being decided in court. But in United Rental's case, Cerberus is citing nothing beyond concerns about the debt and credit markets as its reason for wanting out of the original agreement. Furthermore, there is a clause in its merger agreement filed with regulators that deals with "specific performance." This is a legal term meaning that, under certain conditions, the company could force the buyer to go ahead with the deal -- an enforcement that would likely take place through the courts. Several lawyers interviewed on Thursday said that, while the specific performance provision is significant, the merger agreement and related documents appears to ensure that the most United Rentals can get from Cerberus is the $100 million break- up fee, plus some added costs. "I, for the life of me, don't know of any significant transaction of any significant size that has been consummated as a result of a court order over specific performance," said William Conti, a partner at Baker Hostetler. "It's never going to happen. This isn't selling your neighbor your '57 Chevy like you promised." Mark Kelly, a partner at Alston & Bird, also thinks that Cerberus is on the hook for the fee, known in M&A terms as "the reverse break-up fee," but not much else. "In these large LBOs, the quid pro quo for the reverse break-up fee was 'that was all.' In other words, that was all the target would get if the private equity group couldn't get the proceeds of the financing that was committed at signing or otherwise breached its contract," Kelly said. While United Rentals is up in arms about Cerberus walking away due to debt market worries, some shareholders are mad the company failed to disclose troubles with the deal sooner. According to letters obtained by Reuters, Cerberus was worried about the credit and financing markets roughly a month after the July agreement. United Rentals wrote on September 6 that they were surprised at Cerberus' concerns and pointed out the firm had committed debt financing for the deal. "The lack of disclosure to me is amazing," said a hedge fund investor in United Rentals, who did not want to be named. His feelings show that litigation could be aimed at both Cerberus and United Rentals. "They're going to have to explain the discloser. I think we're going to end up in court," he added.
