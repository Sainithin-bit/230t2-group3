 COPENHAGEN  (Reuters) - Carlsberg ( CARLb.CO ) and Heineken ( HEIN.AS ) increased their bid for Scottish and Newcastle (S&N) SCTN.L on Thursday, raising the stakes for the UK brewer which again emphatically rejected the offer. 

 Denmark's Carlsberg and Amsterdam-based Heineken raised their proposed cash offer to 750 pence per share, valuing Britain's last big independent brewer at 7.3 billion pounds ($15 billion), from their opening bid last month of 720p. But S&N, makers of Newcastle Brown Ale, Foster's and Kronenbourg, continued to rebuff the would-be buyers. "The board, having consulted its advisers, has no hesitation in rejecting this wholly inadequate proposal as it substantially undervalues the unique strengths and market position of S&N," the Edinburgh-based brewer said in a statement. Carlsberg and Heineken later said in a statement they were "disappointed by the tone and speed" of S&N's rejection. "We find the board's intransigence and ill-informed rejection very disappointing. The time has come for S&N shareholders to direct their Board to engage with us," Carlsberg Chief Executive Jorgen Buhl Rasmussen said in a statement. The firms added that they wanted to  meet S&N's board to convert the proposal into a firm, recommended offer. The revised offer sent S&N's shares higher and they closed up 2.2 percent at 757 pence. The stock had already been trading above the new bid price when the increase was announced. Heineken shares were down 2.7 percent at 45.10 euros while Carlsberg was 0.15 percent lower at 647 Danish crowns. Shares in S&N spiked last month when Carlsberg and Heineken revealed they were planning a bid. The world's fifth- and fourth-biggest brewers intend to share out the assets to overcome antitrust concerns. "The bid is a fig leaf for the board of S&N to invite them to negotiate. With this raised offer, the (S&N) board can say that they have got something for being so resolute," said Jyske Bank analyst Jens Thomsen. CURSORY DISMISSAL Thomsen said it was realistic to believe Carlsberg and Heineken would further raise the bid to 775 pence but not as high as 800. Carlsberg and Heineken said in a joint statement the new price gave S&N an equity value of 7.3 billion pounds and an enterprise value of about 9.7 billion, "substantially in excess of the standalone independent value of S&N." The brewers said that following S&N's "cursory dismissal" of their initial offer and its refusal to talk, they had decided to give details of the higher bid directly to the market. This would help shareholders in the British brewer when evaluating S&N's trading and strategy update on November 20. Carlsberg Chief Executive Jorgen Rasmussen told Reuters in a telephone interview the Danish brewer and its advisers had been approached by numerous S&N shareholders who wanted an end to speculation over the bid for the British brewer. He said he was in London and hoped for a meeting with S&N. Carlsberg declined to comment on S&N's statement of rejection. Under the plan, Carlsberg would acquire S&N's 50 percent stake in Russia-based BBH -- a venture jointly owned with Carlsberg -- as well as businesses in France, Greece and China. BBH is seen as the jewel in S&N's crown as it controls over 85 percent of Baltika PKBA.MM, the biggest brewer in Russia, which is the world's third-largest beer market. S&N last month started proceedings to break up the BBH venture in a move analysts regarded as an attempt to extract a higher offer. Heineken would take control of S&N's business in Britain and other European markets such as Belgium and Portugal, as well as its U.S. and Indian businesses. Carlsberg and Heineken's bid company would be a 50-50 venture with economic contribution by Carlsberg and Heineken being 54 and 46 percent, respectively. S&N has been seen as a takeover target for many years with Carlsberg touted as the most likely suitor. The world's top brewer, Belgium-based Interbrew, now known as InBev INTB.BR, bought the brewing businesses of Britain's Bass in 2000 and Whitbread in 2001.
