 LONDON  (Reuters) - Two of Britain's biggest banks this week lost $6 billion from their exposure to the U.S. housing crisis and related credit crunch, soothing fears of even bigger losses but failing to dispel worries among investors. 

 The writedowns unveiled by HSBC ( HSBA.L ) and Barclays ( BARC.L ) mean that together they have lost about $60 million a day in recent months. For HSBC, the problem is mainly on U.S. home loans it has made that have turned sour. Barclays' exposure is on more complex products based on U.S. mortgages, notably collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). But for both the worry is that more losses could come as it remains impossible to predict when the credit environment for consumers and corporates will recover. "The message that we've heard from both of them is things could still get worse, there could still be other things to come in 2008," said Colin Morton, fund manager at Rensburg Fund Management. "Barclays is probably as good as we could have expected, it's pretty good disclosure, we've got a good idea of their position and what they've written off, but some people are still worried there could be more writedowns to come." Shares in Britain's banks have been battered in the last four months as worries mount they have been caught out by the deepening crisis in the U.S. subprime housing market or are left holding risky securities as market liquidity has dried up. The UK bank sector .FTASX8350 is down 13 percent since the start of August, compared to a flat FTSE 100  .FTSE  index. Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland ( RBS.L ) have borne the brunt of the selloff as they are more active in capital markets. Barclays responded on Thursday with a surprise trading update for its investment bank arm, Barclays Capital, unveiling a 1.3 billion pound ($2.7 billion) writedown for the third quarter and October. "Barclays hopes it has written off as much as it needs to, but whether the market is in the mood to accept that it's all behind us is very debatable ... it has eased some concerns, but it hasn't put everything to bed yet," Rensburg's Morton said. Barclays shares immediately jumped over 6 percent after the statement, but by mid-afternoon they were down 1 percent -- performing better than other UK banks which saw a big fall, but still extending their drop this month alone to 13 percent. Analysts at Credit Suisse reflected the mood of many: "We applaud the disclosure but remain 'neutral' believing that there could be worse to come for the bank sector as a whole." OUTLOOK FOR 2008 Several analysts said even though banks were trading at their lowest valuations for years, it is likely to take months to restore confidence to investors who have turned more risk averse since the summer. On top of writedowns, the fear is that 2008 income will be hit hard by less demand for capital markets products, while the current woes will further strain some stretched balance sheets. Banks have also acknowledged they are unsure of the 2008 outlook, which offers little comfort to investors even if they know the extent of still sizeable exposure to CDOs and positions in leveraged finance or on the trading book. "There's uncertainty because the exposures are high," said Philip Richards, bank analyst at Execution. "It's positive that they (Barclays) have given a lot of disclosure, but unless you know what's going to happen in the market you don't know how that's going to feed through." RBS, whose shares fell a further 4 percent on Thursday, is not due to issue a trading update until December 6 and declined to comment on speculation it may provide some clarity before then. Its position could be made more complex by its acquisition of ABN AMRO's wholesale business, analysts said. HSBC, now the world's largest bank outside China, took a $3.4 billion charge for its U.S. consumer finance business in the third quarter and warned problems had spread to other areas of U.S. consumer credit, such as cards and personal loans. The UK bank losses are modest compared with those of rivals Citigroup ( C.N ) and Merrill Lynch MER.N, which have written off $11 billion and $8 billion respectively. Banks around the world have announced about $50 billion in losses and writedowns in the past month. (Editing by Quentin Bryar)
