 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Oracle Corp ORCL.O Chief Executive Larry Ellison said on Wednesday that if his company were to make another offer for BEA Systems Inc BEAS.O, it would be below its original $17-per-share offer. 

 Oracle, the world's number-three software maker, withdrew its bid on October 28 and BEA has said it would begin negotiations to sell the company with any suitor willing to start talks at $21 a share. So far BEA, a business software maker, has not disclosed that anybody has come forth with such a proposal. "It looks like nobody is going to buy BEA," Ellison said during an analyst meeting in San Francisco late on Wednesday. "At $17 a share it was a highly accretive transaction. Why were we buying them? For the money," he said. "If we made another offer, the price would be lower." (Reporting by  Eric Auchard , with additional reporting by Jim Finkle in Boston; Editing by  Braden Reddall )
