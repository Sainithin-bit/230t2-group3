 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Starbucks Corp. ( SBUX.O ) Chief Executive Jim Donald said on Thursday that the company's 2008 sales and earnings targets do not factor in a price increase. 

 "There is no price increase in that number," Donald said in an interview. He also said the company still expects to open 10,000 stores over the next four years despite scaling back its store opening target for next year. (Reporting by  Nichola Groom ; Editing by  Gary Hill )
