 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - BP Plc ( BP.L ) said on Thursday it would sell all 700 of its U.S. owned-and-operated convenience stores to franchise owners, eliminating nearly 10,000 employees. 

 The financial impact of the move was not released. The planned sales will take about two years to complete and call for the buyers to sign 20-year franchise agreements requiring them to sell BP or ARCO branded fuels. The move is a continuation of BP's announcement in October to simplify its operations, a BP spokesman said. BP sells more than 15 billion gallons of gasoline per year in the United States through 13,000 retail outlets. The jobs eliminated include 9,500 convenience store workers, 350 business support staff and about 100 people at its pipelines and logistics operation. Large distributors, also called jobbers, and distributors will also buy some of the retail outlets, the company said. (Reporting by  Matt Daily ; Editing by  Brian Moss )
