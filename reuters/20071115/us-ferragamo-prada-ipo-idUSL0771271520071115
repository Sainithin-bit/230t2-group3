 LONDON  (Reuters) - Prada and Salvatore Ferragamo will be competing in more than just style next year as two of Italy's oldest luxury goods firms look set to go head to head in their bourse debuts. 

 They are both likely to select global coordinators and underwriters towards the end of the month as they aim for share sales of 20 to 30 percent in the second quarter of 2008, people familiar with the matter have said. Among those banks in the running are Goldman Sachs ( GS.N ) and Merrill Lynch MER.N, and Italian investment bank Mediobanca ( MDBI.MI ), people familiar with the matter said. Italy's luxury goods firms, often still family owned and run, have started to seek outside investment to fund international expansion and cash in on booming demand for designer goods in new markets like Asia. The industry is under-represented on the stock market, though, making fund allocations slim and IPO timing key, particularly when high-end spending among U.S. consumers is showing signs of cooling. Both Prada and Ferragamo are rushing ahead to hit the market before any slowdown threatens to hit the stellar multiples being enjoyed by the industry, led by Hermes International's ( HRMS.PA ) 30 times forecasts earnings. "We are very close to a peak in the luxury market. If the U.S. market slows down materially you may see some companies reporting less brilliant results and then multiples are going to be degraded," one fashion insider said who declined to be named. Listing plans for Ferragamo are more advanced than at Prada, one person familiar with the matter said, acknowledging the Florentine fashion house had speeded up its efforts. Prada faced a similar catwalk fight in 2002 before it baulked, leaving the runway clear for Burberry ( BRBY.L ) to brave turbulent equity markets and reap an almost threefold rise in market capitalization. Burberry had the market advantage as it was able to sell itself more widely as a retail brand listing in London. This time Prada may claim the broader appeal. DUEL "For Ferragamo the potential clash in timing is even more of an issue. Like every Italian brand business it is going to appeal to retail investors in Italy which will be undermined by Prada going out at the same time," a person familiar with the industry said. Intesa SanPaolo owns 5 percent of Prada, for which it paid 100 million euros in November 2006, giving the company a base valuation of 2 billion euros ($2.94 billion). Prada spokesman Tomaso Galli has told Reuters it could be worth 3.5 billion euros. Ferragamo, held by shoe designer Salvatore Ferragamo's eighty-five year-old widow Wanda and her children, is seen coming in at upwards of 1 billion euros. One of the major complications in preparing it for a listing was deciding how to unravel its complicated family ownership structure spanning several generations and more than a dozen family members, two industry sources said. In terms of earnings, Prada boosted net profit 63 percent last year to 76 million euros on revenues of 1.4 billion euros. Ferragamo has not publicly released figures but had 2006 sales of 631 million euros, a recent Merrill Lynch report said. While both companies started almost 100 years ago making leather goods, Prada's broader product range and high-profile marketing forays into the worlds of sailing, art and architecture make it more internationally-known than Ferragamo. "Ferragamo does not have the scope or breadth of Prada. It has a nice shoes business. But it is not like Miuccia Prada who defines to the world what fashion is season after season," the same industry source said. To its disadvantage, Prada, owned by husband and wife Patrizio Bertelli and Miuccia Prada and their families, has created some skepticism in the financial world for shelving an IPO four times since 2001. "The pressure is on for Bertelli. If he cancels once more he will never be taken seriously by the financial community again," an investment banker said. The business brains behind the transformation of a Milanese leather company founded by Miuccia Prada's grandfather into a global brand, Bertelli is known for his temper and a need for control that spirals right down to designing shoes. "Bertelli is very much his own man. He doesn't like to listen to other people, which is frustrating for bankers because they always think they know best," said a banker who worked on previous Prada IPO plans. (Editing by David Cowell)
