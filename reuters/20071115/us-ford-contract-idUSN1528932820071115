 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co ( F.N ) said on Thursday that the annual net cash savings from a new trust fund being established to take over retiree health care liabilities is estimated at $1 billion. 

 In a presentation for financial analysts, the U.S. automaker said that it has agreed to form a new Voluntary Employees Beneficiary Association trust with the United Auto Workers union as part of a just-ratified labor contract. Ford also said it will pay $2.7 billion "up-front" in cash to fund the health care trust, which is expected to be created by January 1, 2010. (Reporting by  Poornima Gupta , editing by Gerald E.
