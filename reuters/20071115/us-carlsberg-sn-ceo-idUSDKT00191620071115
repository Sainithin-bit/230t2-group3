 COPENHAGEN  (Reuters) - Carlsberg ( CARLb.CO ) said on Thursday it and its financial advisors had been approached by numerous Scottish & Newcastle SCTN.L shareholders who wanted an end to speculation over the bid for the British brewer. 

 Carlsberg and partner Heineken ( HEIN.AS ) on Thursday raised their bid proposal for Scottish & Newcastle to 750 pence a share, valuing the British brewer at around 7.3 billion pounds ($15 billion). "Many shareholders have contacted us and our banks with expectations and concerns. They want a conclusion to this," Carlsberg Chief Executive Jorgen Rasmussen told Reuters. Carlsberg and Heineken said the new cash proposal was a "full and fair" offer and represented an increase of 30p from its previous proposal. (Reporting by  Mette Fraende , Editing by Erica Billingham)
