 MIAMI  (Reuters) - A U.S. judge ordered the U.S. Justice Department on Wednesday to spell out how far it is willing to go to force Swiss bank UBS AG ( UBSN.VX )( UBS.N ) to hand over confidential client information to U.S. authorities. 

 In a court filing ahead of a court hearing he is due to preside over beginning on Monday in Miami, U.S. District Court Judge Alan Gold asked if the department was considering "receivership and/or seizure of UBS' assets within the United States." Such a move may be contemplated, he said, if UBS failed to comply with a possible court order to disclose data on about 52,000 U.S. taxpayer accounts sought by U.S. tax authorities.
