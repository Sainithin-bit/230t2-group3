 MILAN  (Reuters) - Barack Obama dressed like Steve McQueen? 

 World leaders gathering in Italy for a summit this week will be able to don parkas designed by Belstaff, the maker of the movie star's jackets if things get stormy. Belstaff, which also kits out current film stars such as George Clooney and Brad Pitt, has produced a limited edition black parka for delegates at the summit. And there's a "parka-chic" version for the first ladies. "Every single jacket is made to measure," Manuele Malenotti, whose Italy-based Clothing Co bought Belstaff in 2004, told Reuters. "Every single jacket is signed by (Italian Prime Minister Silvio) Berlusconi." The black mid-thigh jacket features an Italian flag and G8 logo on the right breast pocket. It is made of a light but strong cotton fabric which is water resistant and breathable. Styling goes back to Belstaff's durable clothing traditions which have been used by adventurers such as T.E. Lawrence and Che Guevara. "We were thinking of something related to safety and protection, given the summit is based in L'Aquila," Malenotti said. L'Aquila suffered a major earthquake in April. After the summit, a version of the jacket will go on sale to the public. A percentage of revenues will be donated to the Earthquake Foundation to support the local population. Malenotti said typically Belstaff contributes between 10-20 percent of the retail price to support charities. Belstaff's replica Che Guevara jacket retails online for 495 pounds ($801). And for Michelle Obama? Her version will be made of leather and nylon but retain the military inspiration, Malenotti said. "It's parka-chic," he added.
