 (Reuters) - Ruth Madoff, the wife of imprisoned fraudster Bernard Madoff, will get her passport back, after U.S. District Judge Denny Chin Monday authorized U.S. Probation and Pretrial Services officials to return it, court documents showed. 

 The passport was surrendered as a bail package condition of Bernard Madoff in December. The U.S. Attorney's Office did not oppose the request. Chin handed Bernard Madoff a sentence of 150 years imprisonment last week. Under an agreement with prosecutors, Ruth Madoff, 68, agreed to forfeit any claims to $80 million in assets and was left with $2.5 million in cash. She also gave up rights to $2.6 million in jewelry, a mink coat appraised at $12,500 and a Russian sable worth $36,000. The case is In re USA v Madoff 09-213 in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York (Manhattan) (Reporting by  Ajay Kamalakaran  in Bangalore; Editing by  Anshuman Daga )
