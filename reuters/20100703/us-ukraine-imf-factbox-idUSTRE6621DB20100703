 KIEV  (Reuters) - The International Monetary Fund said on Saturday it had reached a preliminary agreement with Ukraine on a new $14.9 billion stand-by facility to underpin government finances and economic recovery. 

 Below is a brief history of Ukraine's previous dealings with the IMF. 1998-2002 Ukraine received $2.8 billion under an extended fund facility. 2004-2005 The IMF approved a stand-by facility for Ukraine worth about $600 million but the money has not been drawn. 2008-2009 Ukraine drew about $10.4 billion under a $16.4 billion stand-by facility before it was suspended after the government reneged on promises of financial constraint. The money is yet to be repaid. REPAYMENT SCHEDULE According to the IMF, Ukraine is due to repay about $75 million to the IMF this year; $148 million in 2011; $2.4 billion in 2012; $3.5 billion in 2013 and $1.3 billion in 2014.
