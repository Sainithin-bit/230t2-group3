 BANGALORE  (Reuters) - Billionaire investor Warren Buffett said on Tuesday he was looking to invest in large countries like India. 

 Buffett heads Berkshire Hathaway Inc ( BRKa.N ), which has substantial insurance and utility investments globally. "I don't consider India as an emerging market, I consider India as a very big market," he told reporters. "We continue to look at large countries like India." Buffett in South Korea on Monday said Berkshire Hathaway, which at the year-end was sitting on $38 billion of cash equivalents and last week bought U.S. specialty chemicals maker Lubrizol LZ.N for $9 billion, was looking for more large-scale acquisitions anywhere in the world.
