 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The glass ceiling remains for women in the American media industry, despite growing numbers of female workers in the sector, a women's media organization said on Tuesday. 

 The Global Report on Status of Women in News Media found that women make up 23 percent of top-level management of American newspapers, television and radio stations. Women make up 35 percent of executive positions. In newsrooms, women are approaching parity with 41 percent of newsroom leadership positions and they account for 47 percent of junior professionals. As middle managers, women have actually surpassed men in numbers with 56 percent. Women are over-represented on the business side of journalism, accounting for 73 percent of sales, finance and administrative workers. The two-year study by the International Women's Media Foundation surveyed over 500 news organizations in 60 countries around the world. Researchers found that 27 percent of top management positions worldwide are held by women. A similar study by Margaret Gallagher from 1995 found that women held only 12 percent of management positions worldwide. (Reporting by  Wendell Marsh ; Editing by  Greg McCune )
