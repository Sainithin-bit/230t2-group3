 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The U.S. Congress faces a series of confrontations over spending, borrowing and other fiscal policies when it resumes on March 28. 

 Following are some questions and answers about the topic that has dominated Capitol Hill even as popular revolts break out across the Middle East and Japan struggles to avert a nuclear meltdown. WHAT IS BEHIND THE BUDGET DEBATE? As the United States emerges from the worst economic downturn since the 1930s, it faces mammoth long-term budget deficits and a rapidly growing debt load. Experts say the country could be headed for a Greece-style debt crisis if lawmakers don't bring spending in line with revenues. Republicans are pushing for sharp cuts to domestic spending as a first step to reining in deficits that are projected to hit $1.4 trillion this fiscal year by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. Democrats, who control the Senate, agree on the need to reduce deficits over the next several years, but warn that the fragile economic recovery could be damaged if government spending is curtailed abruptly. They also point out that the domestic discretionary spending that Republicans are targeting accounts for only 13 percent of the $3.7 trillion budget. HOW IS THE DEBATE PLAYING OUT? Congress faces at least three separate budget battles over the coming months: * Lawmakers must finalize spending levels for the current fiscal year, which is nearly halfway through. * They must begin work on a budget for the next fiscal year, which starts October 1. By law, Congress must agree on a broad budget outline by April 15, though that deadline is frequently missed. After that, they need to pass 12 separate spending bills that actually release the money that funds federal operations. * Then, Congress is going to have to hold a vote on whether to raise the country's debt ceiling. The Treasury Department says the country will bump up against its statutory $14.3 trillion borrowing limit in mid-April or May. Without an increase, the government faces a possible default on its loans. * Finally, many in the Senate are calling for a comprehensive effort to stabilize the country's balance sheet by examining taxes, annual discretionary spending and a possible overhaul of benefit programs like Social Security and Medicare. Nearly two-thirds of the chamber's 100 members signed a letter asking President Barack Obama to get more involved. WHY IS CONGRESS STILL FIGHTING OVER A BUDGET WHEN THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR IS NEARLY HALFWAY THROUGH? Democrats did not pass any of the 12 spending bills needed to keep the government running last year when they controlled both the House and the Senate. Republicans, who won control of the House in November, are now trying to fulfill a campaign promise to roll back domestic spending to 2008 levels. The bill they passed in February would do that by cutting $61 billion from current spending levels, which would require government agencies to throttle back spending by an average of 25 percent. That bill has failed in the Senate, which is still controlled by Democrats, and lawmakers have extended a temporary spending measure through April 8 to give themselves more negotiating time. WHAT'S THE LIKELY OUTCOME OF THE STANDOFF? Support is waning for another extension, so lawmakers likely will have two weeks to resolve their differences when they return to Washington on March 28. They have already agreed to about $10 billion in mostly noncontroversial cuts, but that's still a long way from the Republicans' $61 billion figure. Observers say House Speaker John Boehner faces a difficult decision. He could forge a coalition of moderate Republicans and Democrats to pass a compromise measure that includes some cuts, but that could alienate the anti-spending Tea Party activists who enabled him to win control of the chamber. Tea Party-aligned Republicans have already shown that they are growing increasingly impatient with the standoff, and 54 of them voted against the last stopgap measure. If Boehner keeps his party united and pushes for further confrontation with Democrats, that could risk a government shutdown. "Speaker Boehner has got to figure out how he brings his troops along," said Joe Minarik, a former budget official for Democratic President Bill Clinton. WHAT ARE THE ODDS OF A SHUTDOWN? Somewhere between "unlikely" and "increasingly possible." Republican and Democratic leaders have repeatedly said they do not want to let government funding expire, which would force a shutdown of nonessential services such as passport offices and national parks. Republican leaders are painfully aware that the public largely blamed them for the last shutdown in 1995 and 1996, which led to the downfall of Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich and helped Democratic President Bill Clinton win re-election. Democrats, meanwhile, are mindful of polls that show they would not necessarily benefit from a shutdown this time after losing the battle for public opinion on the 2009 stimulus and last year's healthcare overhaul. "Democrats must face the reality that it has been years since they have won any messaging fight," political analyst Charlie Cook wrote in the National Journal last week. At the same time, Democrats may decide that they cannot sign off on budget cuts that would anger organized labor and other core constituencies. Boehner and House Republican Leader Eric Cantor may decide they cannot afford to alienate the Tea Party base. "Boehner and Cantor have to do something very soon to convince the Tea Party wing of their caucus that they are on their side," wrote Stan Collender, a budget analyst for Quorvis Communications. "Allowing or forcing a shutdown to occur may be just what the leadership needs to do to demonstrate its commitment to the Tea Party's preferred policies and style." (Editing by  Philip Barbara )
