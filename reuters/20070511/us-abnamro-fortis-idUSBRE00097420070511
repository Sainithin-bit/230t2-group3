 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - Belgian-Dutch financial services group Fortis FOR.BRFOR.AS said on Friday the consortium seeking to take over ABN AMRO AAH.AS would make a further statement on its intentions before May 27. 

 "Fortis, Royal Bank of Scotland and Santander will make a further statement regarding their intention before such (ABN AMRO extraordinary) shareholder meeting, in any event before May 27, 2007, the end of a 30-day period since the announcement by Fortis, Santander, Royal Bank of Scotland on April 27," Chief Financial Officer Gilbert Mittler told a conference call. Mittler declined to make any further comment on the issue beyond saying that the three banks may be required to make an announcement sooner. The consortium of Royal Bank of Scotland ( RBS.L ), Spain's Santander ( SAN.MC ) and Fortis FOR.AS has proposed a 72 billion euro ($97.02 billion) bid for ABN to rival an agreed merger between ABN and Barclays ( BARC.L ). ABN AMRO has said it plans to hold an extraordinary meeting for shareholders to express their views, but has not set a date. It had originally scheduled an extraordinary meeting in August after it unveiled the proposed merger with Barclays two weeks ago. Barclays and ABN announced on April 23 that the British bank had agreed to buy its Dutch rival for about 67 billion euros in shares.
