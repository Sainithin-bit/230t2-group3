 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Calls by an FDA panel of experts for further restrictions on the use of anemia drugs sold by Amgen Inc. ( AMGN.O ) and Johnson & Johnson ( JNJ.N ) sent Amgen investors heading for the exits, while analysts raced to cut ratings on the stock and sales estimates. 

 The medicines -- Amgen's Aranesp and Epogen and J&J's Procrit -- had already been under considerable pressure as a raft of negative clinical news led to questions about their potential overuse and the possible harm they could be doing. The cloud that got darker in March, when the U.S. Food and Drug Administration added new warnings to the drugs' labels, turned black on Thursday when the advisory panel came down hard on the marketing and use of the anemia drugs that had combined sales of $10 billion last year. "The panel discussing the use of (the anemia drugs) in oncology was much harsher than we expected, recommending further tightening beyond the restrictions the FDA recently invoked," Lazard analyst Joel Sendek wrote in a research note in which he took his rating on Amgen shares all the way down to a "sell" from "buy." Sendek forecast a 21 percent decrease in worldwide Aranesp sales this year and significantly lowered his earnings per share projections through 2010, taking his 2007 EPS forecast down to $4.09 from $4.30 and 2010 to $4.80 from $5.77. Citigroup also hit Amgen's stock with the rare "sell" rating, down from "hold." The impact has been relatively mild on J&J, a huge health care products conglomerate that is not nearly as dependent on robust Procrit sales for revenue growth. But Aranesp is by far Amgen's biggest product and, along with Epogen, accounts for roughly half of the world's largest biotechnology company's profit. Amgen shares have fallen about 12 percent since the FDA panel's vote on Thursday afternoon, reaching a low not seen in nearly three years. J&J shares were up on Friday after dropping about 2 percent following the panel vote. Among other things, the panel recommended not using the drugs in patients with certain cancer types and restricting use once chemotherapy is halted. The panel also recommended tightening the marketing of the drugs and called for more studies to be conducted. "The meeting's outcome matched our worst fears about the risk for a potential unexpectedly bad outcome," Sanford Bernstein analyst Geoffrey Porges wrote in a research note. "We had not anticipated that the committee and the FDA could challenge the current use in so many ways and directions," said Porges, who estimated that, if the drugs were to be banned for use by people with breast cancer, it could eliminate 19 percent of Aranesp patients and 16 percent of Procrit patients. The products are man-made forms of the natural protein, erythropoietin, or Epo for short, used to increase red blood cells to combat anemia caused by chemotherapy and in patients with kidney failure. There has been some fear in the medical community that the drugs could be feeding growth of certain tumor types, although the panel members endorsed their continued use in preventing the need for blood transfusions. Several other industry analysts cut ratings on Amgen's stock, including HSBC to "neutral" from "overweight," Morgan Stanley to "equalweight" from "overweight" and JP Morgan to "neutral" from "overweight." Jefferies & Co. analyst Adam Walsh cut his price target on the stock to $55 from $64 and lowered Aranesp sales projections every year through 2011, when he cut his forecast by 23 percent to $3.8 billion. CIBC World Markets analyst Bret Holley dropped his Amgen 12 to 18-month price target to $65 from $72, saying he expects the shares to settle in the low-to-mid $50s near-term. But Holley said positive data from a promising experimental osteoporosis drug and potential delays in getting to market by a competing anemia drug from Roche Holding AG ( ROG.VX ) could "help offset this overhang." Bucking the bearish trend, A.G. Edwards and Deutsche Bank maintained "buy" ratings on Amgen shares. Amgen shares were down $1.75, or 3 percent, at $55.58 in afternoon trading on Nasdaq after falling more than 9 percent Thursday. The shares of J&J were up 34 cents at $62.84 on the New York Stock Exchange.
