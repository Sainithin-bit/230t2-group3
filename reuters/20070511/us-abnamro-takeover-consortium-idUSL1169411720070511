 AMSTERDAM  (Reuters) - A consortium of banks led by Royal Bank of Scotland ( RBS.L ) seeking to take over ABN AMRO AAH.AS told the Dutch bank it will take three years to split the company if it wins control, a newspaper reported on Friday. 

 The consortium of RBS, Fortis FOR.BR and Santander ( SAN.MC ), which has proposed a 72 billion euro ($97.47 billion) bid for ABN to rival an agreed merger between ABN and Barclays ( BARC.L ), told ABN in weekend talks that it would take until 2011 to break up ABN amongst themselves, Dutch daily Het Financieele Dagblad reported. The difficulty of splitting up ABN and the risks involved are the reasons for the long time period, the newspaper reported, citing unnamed sources. ABN is caught in a legal struggle over a side deal to the $88 billion Barclays merger to sell its U.S. subsidiary LaSalle to Bank of America ( BAC.N ) for $21 billion. Shareholders, some of whom called the LaSalle deal a "poison pill" making it difficult for them to consider alternate offers, revolted against the Barclays and Bank of America deals, and succeeded last week in getting the enterprise court in Amsterdam to freeze the LaSalle sale. ABN said the offer by RBS and its partners Santander and Fortis was not superior to its deal to sell LaSalle to Bank of America because the RBS offer was conditional on the consortium acquiring all of ABN and carried execution risks. Bank of America then sued ABN, and ABN has appealed the court decision.
