 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. antitrust authorities said on Friday they approved U.S. Steel Corp.'s ( X.N ) planned $2.1 billion acquisition of Lone Star Technologies Inc. LSS.N. 

 Officials completed their investigation of the deal without taking any action, the Federal Trade Commission said in a notice. U.S. Steel announced the deal in March, saying it would expand its reach in the lucrative oilfield sector. Lone Star makes products to line oil and gas wells and build pipelines. The deal calls for Pittsburgh-based U.S. Steel to pay $67.50 per share of Lone Star. U.S. Steel has said it will pay for the purchase through a combination of cash on hand and financing obtained under its existing receivables purchase program and three new fully committed bank credit facilities provided by JPMorgan Chase & Co. ( JPM.N ), she said.
