 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - KB Home Inc. ( KBH.N ) said on Friday it was considering several alternatives after receiving a 53.13 euros-per-share offer for its nearly 11 million share stake in its French subsidiary Kaufman & Broad SA KBH.PA. 

 KB Home, which has seen its shares battered by a slowdown in the U.S. housing industry, said it was evaluating the offer and was also considering a public or private offering of the shares, retaining the stake or other alternatives. The offer totals about 580 million euros ($783 million), but far below the 59.30 euros the stock was trading at Friday. Los Angeles-based KB Home, the No. 5 U.S. home builder, did not disclose the potential buyer of its stake in its French subsidiary and said it did not intend to make any other announcements unless a transaction is finalized. KB Home reported an 84 percent drop in first-quarter profit in March and warned that higher foreclosures and tighter lending standards in the broader market could prolong weakness across the sector. Kaufman & Broad designs and builds apartments, single-family homes and some office properties. KB Home shares jumped after the announcement in premarket trade and were up about 4 percent at $44.95, while Kaufman & Broad shares were down 4.71 percent at 59.30 euros on Euronext Paris. Through Thursday, KB Home shares were down nearly 16 percent so far in 2007.
