 DETROIT  (Reuters) - DaimlerChrysler AG's Chrysler group is recalling 270,958 minivans in the United States to fix faulty air bag sensors as they may not deploy because of corrosion, U.S. safety regulators said. 

 The vehicles being recalled are 2005 model-year Town and Country and Dodge Caravan minivans. "Certain minivans are being recalled in states which use large amounts of salt for road de-icing to replace their up-front air bag sensors," the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said on its Web site,  here "Sensors with brass bushings may corrode and crack allowing water to enter the sensor, causing it to fail, illuminating the air bag warning light," NHTSA said. Chrysler spokesman Max Gates said on Friday the company has extended the warranty on another 133,000 of the minivans.
