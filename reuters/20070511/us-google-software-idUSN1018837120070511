 MOUNTAIN VIEW, California  (Reuters) - Google Inc.'s corporate tagline has become "Search, Ads and Apps," reflecting a shift beyond search and advertising into online software applications, its chief executive said on Thursday. 

 Speaking to reporters at the company's headquarters ahead of Google's annual shareholder meeting, Chief Executive Eric Schmidt said his presentation to investors on Thursday afternoon would focus on the three parts of its business. Google, the world's dominant provider of Web search, is also the dominant provider of pay-per-click advertising, which contributes virtually all of its revenue. Last year, it entered the software application market with products it collectively refers to as "Google Apps." This refers to a series of online software applications and Web publishing tools it provides free to consumers. It also offers a premium, licensed version to companies, government organizations and universities. It marks a challenge to Microsoft Corp.'s Office software franchise, according to analysts. The company's nascent diversification into applications software has generated little revenue to date. "The idea here is to talk about this shift to an online lifestyle," Schmidt said of the company's growing focus on delivering Web-based applications, not just search and ads. "People are spending more and more time and Google can bring some of these new applications that really matter to them," he said, highlighting Google Calendar, its group scheduling tool, as an example.
