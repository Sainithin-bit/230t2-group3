 STOCKHOLM  (Reuters) - World number two truck maker Volvo ( VOLVb.ST ) withstood a U.S. slowdown to post a smaller than expected fall in quarterly pre-tax profit on Friday, but weaker orders raised concerns about coming quarters. 

 Hit by falling demand in North America, Volvo's first quarter pre-tax earnings edged down to 5.41 billion crowns ($796 million) from 5.47 billion a year ago. But U.S. cost cuts meant the outcome was well above the mean forecast of 4.66 billion in a Reuters poll of 13 analysts. "These are incredibly strong figures while order bookings at the same time are incredibly bad," one analyst said. "If this is sustained the sum total is negative." Shares in Volvo, which had underperformed the market in the run up to its results, were up around 7 percent at 130.25 crowns by 1057 GMT. Following years of strong growth, Volvo and its peers are experiencing a sharp fall in demand for heavy-duty trucks in the United States -- a hangover from a buying spree ahead of tougher clean-air rules enforced at the turn of the year. The firm began cutting capacity in its U.S. truck business last year to reduce costs. Analysts have estimated the firm had cut capacity by roughly a third going into the first quarter. Volvo said it was also realigning production in connection with the cuts and a move to new engines, hitting output. "These disturbances continue to affect us also in the second quarter, resulting in lower production volumes," the firm said. Volvo said order bookings in North America, its second biggest market after Europe, tumbled 80 percent year-on-year to put total orders down 26 percent in the quarter. The firm said demand in the region would remain low over the near term. While the timing of a rebound was difficult to predict, the total North American heavy-duty truck market would be around 250,000 to 260,000 units by the end of this year. "Towards the end of the year we would expect the market to come back to those kind of running rate numbers," Volvo Chief Executive Leif Johansson told a news conference. The total North American heavy-duty truck market was about 350,000 units last year. "The negative point is orders. That they fell 80 percent in the U.S. was no surprise," said another analyst. "But the falling order intake in Europe is worrying if you compare it to Scania's order bookings." While U.S. truck sales have diminished, Europe has done well and Volvo hiked its European market outlook to about 330,000 units this year from a previous forecast of about 300,000. But Volvo's order bookings in the quarter in Europe for its trucks, which sell under the Mack and Renault brands and its own name, fell 4 percent, hit by product renewals at Renault. Volvo Trucks, which only makes heavy-duty vehicles, saw European orders rise 40 to 45 percent in the quarter, Johansson told Reuters, in line with 45 percent increases reported by rivals MAN ( MANG.DE ) and Scania AB ( SCVb.ST ). Activist investor Cevian, Volvo's second-largest shareholder, has criticised the company for not performing as well as Scania. Volvo increased its 2006 payout to shareholders, partly in response to the criticism. First-quarter sales at the company, which also sells buses, construction equipment and engines, fell to 61.0 billion crowns from 62.7 billion a year ago, beating the 57.21 billion seen by analysts.
