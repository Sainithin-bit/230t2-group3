 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A majority of Blockbuster Inc.'s BBI.N shareholders voted in favor of a "say-on-pay" proposal, marking the first clear victory by shareholders seeking an advisory vote on executive pay, the Wall Street Journal reported on its Web site on Friday. 

 The proposal was backed by 57 percent of the shares voted at the company's annual meeting, the Journal said, citing New York City Comptroller William Thompson, who sponsored the proposal on behalf the New York City Employees' Retirement System. The proposal was nonbinding, the Journal said. Blockbuster could not immediately be reached for comment.
