 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Sales by U.S. retailers fell 0.2 percent to a seasonally adjusted $372.03 billion in April as soaring gasoline prices and a slumping housing industry sapped consumers' appetite for spending, a Commerce Department report on Friday showed. 

 The report offered persuasive signs that the combined stress from costlier fuel and falling housing prices were turning consumers cautious - spending on building materials took the biggest tumble in more than four years and new-car sales fell by the largest amount since mid-2006. Excluding automobiles that account for 20 percent of total retail business, sales were flat in April but that was following a 1.1 percent March increase. The sales figures came in much weaker than Wall Street economists had forecast and will reinforce worry that consumers will have difficulty sustaining their spending punch that fuels two-thirds of national economic activity. Total retail sales had been forecast to rise 0.4 percent, instead of decline, and sales excluding automobiles also had been predicted to gain 0.4 percent rather than being flat. The 0.2 percent April sales drop contrasted with a 1 percent March gain. It was the first outright drop in monthly sales since last September when they fell 0.6 percent although total sales were flat in both January and last October. The declines were widespread in April. Building material sales plunged 2.3 percent - the biggest decline since February 2003 when they were down 5.1 percent -- after rising 1 percent in March. New-car sales were down 1 percent in April after rising 0.4 percent in March. It was the biggest drop in monthly car sales since last June when they were down 2.4 percent.
