 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A shareholder in the Sun-Times Media Group SVN.N said on Friday that it may talk to the U.S. newspaper publisher about a possible sale of the company. 

 In a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Cardinal Capital Management LLC said it also would discuss other alternatives for the company, which publishes the Chicago Sun-Times. Cardinal holds 2.94 percent of the company's outstanding Class A common stock, according to the filing. Sun-Times previously was known as Hollinger International Inc.
