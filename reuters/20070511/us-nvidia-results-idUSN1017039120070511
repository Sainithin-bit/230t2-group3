 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Nvidia Corp. ( NVDA.O ) on Thursday posted a higher-than-expected quarterly profit that rose 43 percent from a year earlier as strong sales of graphics chips offset a sharp drop in chipset sales. 

 Nvidia also gave a revenue estimate for its current quarter that was higher than the average Wall Street forecast, and its shares rose 5 percent. "Q2 is usually the slowest quarter for the PC industry. Even so, we believe revenue in Q2 will be flat to slightly up" from the previous quarter, Chief Financial Officer Marvin Burkett told a conference call. Nvidia's revenue was $844.3 million in the first quarter ended April 29, up 24 percent from a year earlier and higher than the $835 million that was the average forecast of analysts on Reuters Estimates. Analysts had been forecasting revenue of $839 million for the second quarter. Growth in sales of graphics chips for notebook laptops, and a recovery in chipsets -- the cluster of secondary components around a computer's processor -- would offset the overall industry sluggishness, Burkett said. Nvidia said net profit for its first quarter rose to $132.3 million, or 33 cents per share, from $92.1 million, or 24 cents per share, a year earlier, beating the average Wall Street estimate by 2 cents. Sales of graphics chips for desktop computers rose 8 percent from the previous quarter as the company increased output of new high-end processors, Burkett said. Professional products used for computerized design, medical imaging and other industries saw revenue rise 11 percent on the quarter, while chipset sales dropped 31 percent, Burkett said. Gross margin was 45 percent, in line with previously stated target, due to the stronger sales of high-end graphics chips, which the company's most profitable items. "We will work very hard to have flat to a slight increase in gross margins," Burkett said of the second quarter. Shares in Nvidia rose 5.2 percent to $34.48 in extended trading. The stock has risen 11 percent over the past year. Nvidia competes with Advanced Micro Devices Inc.'s ( AMD.N ) ATI graphics processor unit, as well as Intel Corp. ( INTC.O ), which offers integrated graphics but does not make separate graphics chips.
