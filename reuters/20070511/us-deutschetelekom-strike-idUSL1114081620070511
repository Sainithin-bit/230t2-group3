 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Thousands of staff went on strike at Deutsche Telekom ( DTEGn.DE ) on Friday to protest against cost-cutting plans in the first major walkout at the company in more than a decade. 

 "We have called on 11,000 staff to join the strike today," trade union Verdi official Ado Wilhelm said. The strike has targeted call centers, technical support and cable installation. Deutsche Telekom has enraged trade unions by trying to move 50,000 staff at its troubled fixed-line unit T-Com into lower-paying subsidiaries to cut costs while customers switch in droves to smaller, cheaper rivals. Wilhelm said the union was prepared to keep the strike going for a long time. Deutsche Telekom did not expect major delays or disruptions. "We have had to deal with short walkouts in the past couple of weeks, so we know what to expect," a company spokesman said. The strike is not expected to spawn much public sympathy. Deutsche Telekom's customer service is routinely ridiculed as sluggish and surly, and one television comedian quipped that Telekom's four remaining customers were unlikely to notice that telephone workers were on strike. Management and labor have failed to reach a compromise over the cost-cutting plans, which Deutsche Telekom sees as a crucial element to remain competitive. Telekom has 80,000 staff at T-Com, its largest division. In comparison, Spain's incumbent telecoms group Telefonica ( TEF.MC ) began reducing staff in 2003 and now has around 28,000 employees at its fixed-line unit in Spain. Telekom shares eased 0.7 percent to 12.56 euros by 0900 GMT, while the German blue-chip index  .GDAXI  fell 1.1 percent. Chief Financial Officer Karl-Gerhard Eick told Reuters on Thursday that he had little hope of coming to terms with Verdi but reiterated the company remained approachable should union officials choose to return to the negotiating table. The chances of that happening are slim, however. Verdi said it is determined to strike until Deutsche Telekom improves an offer that includes extending weekly working hours to 38 from 34 and a gradual pay cut of 9 percent for the staff affected. Eick said Deutsche Telekom could push through its plans by July 1 even it did  not reach an accord with Verdi. "We will make an offer to the 50,000 staff at the end of May that will be based on wage contracts we have negotiated with Verdi at other units," Eick said. Verdi is fiercely opposed to the plans because it fears the new units will eventually be sold and force employees to accept working conditions with little or no wage protection.
