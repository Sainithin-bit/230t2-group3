 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Movie Gallery Inc. MOVI.O posted a quarterly loss versus a year-ago profit due to a charge and lower revenue, sending the No. 2 video rental chain's shares down 8 percent. 

 The Dothan, Alabama-based company reported a net loss of $14.9 million, or 47 cents a share, for the first quarter, compared with a profit of $40.3 million, or $1.27 a share, a year ago. Excluding a 58 cent per share charge to write off unamortized deferred financing fees related to Movie Gallery's senior credit facility, the company earned 11 cents per share. Analysts on average had been expecting a profit of 53 cents a share, excluding items, according to Reuters Estimates. The results also included 21 cents a share in expenses related to rolling out an online DVD rental service, higher professional fees and store closures, the company said. Revenue fell 7 percent to $647.7 million, hurt by fewer stores and lower sales at stores open at least a year. Same-store sales fell 4 percent at Movie Gallery stores and 6.8 percent at the company's Hollywood stores. Chief Executive Joe Malugen blamed a weak roster of release titles, heightened pricing competition, bad weather and the earlier shift this year to daylight savings time. Movie Gallery, which has been losing customers to Netflix Inc. ( NFLX.O ) and Blockbuster Inc.'s BBI.N online service, said it is continuing to pursue initiatives to cut expenses and reposition the company, such as offering more video games and an online DVD rental service. Movie Gallery shares fell 30 cents to $3.25 on the Nasdaq, well off the 52-week high of $7.70 it touched last June. (With reporting by Avishek Mishra in Bangalore)
