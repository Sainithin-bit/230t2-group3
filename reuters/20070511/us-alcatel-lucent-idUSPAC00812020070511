 PARIS  (Reuters) - Alcatel-Lucent ALU.PA on Thursday forecast second-quarter sales growth of 10 percent against the previous three months as it moved into operating loss in the first quarter, hit by merger costs and disruptions. 

 The forecast is based on constant exchange rates. The French-American telecoms equipment group posted an operating loss of 244 million euros for the three months to March 31 and a net profit of 199 million euros. The figures compared with an operating profit of 246 million euros and net profit of 306 million euros in the first quarter of 2006. Alcatel-Lucent predicted full-year sales growth in mid-single digits and said it was on track for 600 million euros in savings in 2007.
