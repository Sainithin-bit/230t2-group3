 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Elevated energy costs pushed producer prices up a slightly more-than-expected 0.7 percent in April, but excluding volatile food and energy costs, prices paid at the factory gate were unchanged, a Labor Department report released on Friday showed. 

 Analysts polled by Reuters were expecting producer prices -- the prices paid by manufacturers and wholesalers -- to rise 0.6 percent and by 0.2 percent when energy and food were excluded. Overall producer prices rose 3.2 percent from the same month a year ago, while core producer prices gained 1.5 percent from April 2006. Energy prices gained 3.4 percent, while food prices rose 0.4 percent in April. It was the smallest gain in food prices since November Producer prices are a measure of prices before they reach the consumer. The Federal Reserve says its predominant concern about the economy is that inflation may fail to moderate, but the U.S. central bank has forecast that price pressures should ease amid steady but sluggish growth.
