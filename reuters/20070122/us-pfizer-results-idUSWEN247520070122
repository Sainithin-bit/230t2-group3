 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc. ( PFE.N ) said on Monday its quarterly profit more than tripled on the sale of its consumer health business, although revenue was flat amid lower sales of its Lipitor cholesterol fighter and generic competition for several medicines. 

 The drugmaker, which meets with analysts later in the day to discuss future strategy, earned $9.45 billion in the fourth quarter, or $1.32 per share, compared with $2.73 billion, or 37 cents per share, a year earlier. The results were due largely to Pfizer's $16.6 billion cash sale of its consumer health products, including Listerine mouthwash and Sudafed allergy drug, last month to Johnson & Johnson ( JNJ.N ). Excluding the sale and other one-time items, the world's largest drug maker earned 43 cents per share, representing a 12 percent decline. Analysts, on average, expected 42 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. Despite its annual $7 billion research budget, Pfizer has been unable to launch enough drugs to offset sales declines of products facing generic competition. Fourth-quarter revenue from both its Zithromax antibiotic and Zoloft anti-depressant, for instance, plunged by more than 70 percent. Monday's strategy meeting follows Pfizer's bombshell announcement on December 2 that it halted studies of torcetrapib, a drug that raises "good" HDL cholesterol, due to safety concerns. Pfizer had been counting on the product to post future annual sales of more than $10 billion. "While we attained nearly all of our financial targets for the year, we continue to face a difficult operating environment, including competitive challenges and the risks inherent in drug development," Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Kindler said in a release. Shares fell sharply on the torcetrapib setback, but have rebounded since the company on December 18 boosted its quarterly dividend 21 percent. But with torcetrapib's demise, Pfizer badly needs new products and revenue by the time Lipitor's patent lapses as early as 2010 and its sales -- now about $13 billion a year -- drop precipitously. Meanwhile, Pfizer is counting on a major cost-cutting campaign to deliver earnings per share growth in 2007 and 2008, on average, in the high single-digit percentage range. The New York-based company, which aims for annual cost savings of $4 billion by 2008, in November said it would cut its U.S. sales force by 20 percent, or 2,200 jobs. Credit Suisse analyst Catherine Arnold on Monday speculated another 10,000 to 12,000 job cuts could be announced at the strategy meeting, creating possible additional savings of $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion. Pfizer's fourth-quarter revenue of $12.6 billion was little different than the year-ago quarter. Zithromax sales fell 73 percent to $109 million, while Zoloft fell 79 percent to $166 million. Sales of Lipitor, which remains the world's top-selling drug, slipped 1 percent to $3.34 billion due in part to competition from far-cheaper generic forms of Merck & Co's ( MRK.N ) Zocor. Impotence-treatment Viagra posted quarterly sales of $450 million, a 5 percent gain, while revenue from allergy drug Zyrtec jumped 14 percent to $374 million. Zyrtec is sold in partnership with Belgian drugmaker UCB UCBBt.BR. Sales of arthritis treatment Celebrex rose 15 percent to $540 million, continuing its recovery from earlier declines that had been spurred by safety concerns. Lyrica, used mainly to treat neuropathic pain caused by diabetes and shingles, more than doubled to $353 million. Pfizer disclosed it has asked U.S. regulators to also approve the medicine as a treatment for fibromyalgia, a pain disorder that predominantly affects women. Shares fell 37 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $28.85 in late-morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange. (Additional reporting by Lewis Krauskopf)
