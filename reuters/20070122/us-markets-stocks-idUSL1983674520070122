 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. stocks slid on Monday as investors sold off shares of technology firms on worries about their earnings outlook, while a brokerage downgrade hurt shares of aircraft maker Boeing Co. ( BA.N ), pushing the blue-chip Dow average down to record its steepest one-day drop in two months. 

 Investors have been growing worried about the outlook for the technology sector after disappointing outlooks or results from tech bellwethers Apple Inc. ( AAPL.O ), Intel Corp. ( INTC.O ) and International Business Machines Corp. ( IBM.N ) . Shares of Motorola Inc. MOT.N fell 2.9 percent as investors were disappointed that the company does not expect profit margins to recover until the second half of the year.  Traders said investors were cautious with more big tech companies like Microsoft Corp.( MSFT.O ) and Qualcomm Inc. ( QCOM.O ) due to report results this week. "There are continued earnings worries because earnings season hasn't started off that well," said Bruce Zaro, chief technical strategist at Delta Global Advisors in Plymouth, Massachusetts. The Dow recorded its biggest one-day percentage decline since late November. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  fell 88.37 points, or 0.70 percent, to end at 12,477.16. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  declined 7.55 points, or 0.53 percent, to finish at 1,422.95. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  lost 20.24 points, or 0.83 percent, to close at 2,431.07. Shares of Microsoft Corp. ( MSFT.O ), fell 1.3 percent after news that IBM will introduce software that could challenge Microsoft's strong e-mail messaging position. BOEING LOSES ALTITUDE Boeing shares declined 3.4 percent, or $3.03, to $85.60 on the New York Stock Exchange after Wachovia cut its rating on the aerospace company to "market perform" from "outperform" on the belief that the commercial aircraft order cycle has peaked. "You obviously had some high-level downgrades, Boeing being the big culprit," said Tom McIntyre, president and chief portfolio manager of McIntyre, Freedman & Flynn in Orleans, Massachussetts. "The market has kind of lost its underpinnings, people are afraid to buy cyclicals, they're afraid to buy oil stocks or anything oil related, and they're afraid to buy technology." TEXAS INSTRUMENTS UP LATE Signs looked ripe for a market turnaround on Tuesday, as shares of cellphone chip maker Texas Instruments Inc. TXN.N rose 1.3 percent to $28.95 after the bell as the company posted a higher quarterly profit. <ID:nN22174163> The stock closed on the NYSE at $28.59, up 0.7 percent, or 20 cents. Shares of Gap Inc.( GPS.N ) shot up 4.5 percent to $20.80 in extended-hours trading after the company's top executive, Paul Pressler resigned. Gap closed at $39.96, up 0.11 percent, or 4 cents, on the NYSE. EXXON MOBIL AND DELL DROP In regular trading, shares of Exxon Mobil fell 0.9 percent, or 63 cents, to $72.90 on the NYSE, as crude oil prices wiped out early gains and ended lower as the February contract expired. February crude CLG7 lost 86 cents to settle at $51.13 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. A small bright spot was the financial sector, with Citigroup Inc. ( C.N ) up 0.3 percent, or 18 cents, at $54.68 as analysts at Prudential raised their rating on the stock after its chief financial officer, Sallie Krawcheck, returned to her old job as head of wealth management.  Shares of JPMorgan Chase & Co. ( JPM.N ) rose about 2 percent to an intraday high of $49.86, their highest level since June 2001, before pulling back some to close at $49.66 on the NYSE. For the day, JPMorgan was up 1.9 percent, or 90 cents. Shares of Dell lost 2.1 percent, or 53 cents, to $24.49 on Nasdaq after UBS lowered its price target on the stock to $26 from $27, saying it believes Dell's fourth-quarter revenue will be weaker than it had originally expected. Microsoft shares fell 1.3 percent, or 39 cents, to $30.72 on Nasdaq. Motorola shares slid 2.9 percent, or 55 cents, to $18.72 on the NYSE. But IBM's stock was up almost 1 percent, or 94 cents, at $97.11 on the NYSE. Trading was moderate on the New York Stock Exchange, with about 1.50 billion shares changing hands, below the 1.84 billion daily average for last year. On Nasdaq, about 2.01 billion shares were traded, below the 2.02 billion daily average last year. Declining shares outnumbered advancing shares by a ratio of about 7 to 4 on the NYSE, and on Nasdaq, by about 2 to 1.
