 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Fuji Xerox, a unit of Japan's Fujifilm 
Holdings ( 4901.T ), said on Monday it expected sales from its 
production services division to rise by roughly 50 percent over 
the next three business years. 

  The company, which is owned 75 percent by Tokyo-based 
Fujifilm and 25 percent by Xerox Corp. ( XRX.N ) of the United 
States, competes against makers such as Canon Inc ( 7751.T ) and 
Ricoh Co. ( 7752.T ) in the office equipment market.  Fuji Xerox said it expects sales from its production 
services division, which handles on-demand printing machines 
and related services, to reach 200 billion yen ($1.65 billion) 
by 2009/10, up from its forecast for slightly more than 130 
billion yen in the year to March 2007.
