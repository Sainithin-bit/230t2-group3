 AMSTERDAM  (Reuters) - Dutch group Philips Electronics on Monday booked a fourth-quarter net profit powered by one-off gains, issued a confident 2007 outlook and raised its 2006 dividend to 0.60 euros per share. 

 Philips's net profit came in at 680 million euros ($881.3 million), compared with an average forecast of 396 million euros by 20 analysts polled by Reuters. Net profit in the year-earlier period was 332 million euros. Net profit was pushed higher by a lower corporate tax rate and an unexpected additional 129 million euro gain from the sale of its chip unit. Revenues at the TVs-to-hospital-equipment maker slipped more than expected to 8.13 billion euros from 9.52 billion a year earlier, and compared with an average analyst forecast of 8.32 billion euros. Sales have declined after Philips sold its semiconductor division to private-equity investors in September, and were further reduced deliberately by exits from less profitable activities in consumer electronics, where Philips focuses on the higher-margin segments of flat televisions and peripherals. Underlying profitability improved, reflecting the shift to more stable and higher-margin business areas such as lighting, medical systems and domestic appliances, which also explains why Philips has raised its dividend to match its new peer group of stable, cash-generating diversified industrial companies. Chief Executive Gerard Kleisterlee told a conference call that Philips was paying out just over 50 percent of its underlying net income and planned to pay out 40 to 50 percent in the future, up from 25 to 35 percent until now. Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) came in at 665 million euros, just above an average analyst expectation of 653 million euros and against a year-earlier profit of 971 million euros, which included one-off gains of 246 million euros. Revised for the sale of the chip unit, the year-ago EBIT was 795 million euros. Philips shares slipped 1.2 percent at 29.02 euros by 1120 GMT, underperforming technology peers in the DJ Stoxx Eurotech index which rose 0.1 percent. "The numbers weren't brilliant excluding the one-off gains," said Petercam analyst Eric de Graaf, who reiterated his "add" recommendation. DIVIDEND, OUTLOOK PLEASE ANALYSTS Jan Willem Berghuis at broker Kempen & Co. welcomed the higher dividend payout ratio and said "the explicit outlook for 2007 is very good news." Philips, the world's biggest lighting maker, a top-three hospital-equipment maker and a top-five consumer electronics producer, reiterated its target for sales to grow by 5 to 6 percent in 2007 and for earnings before interest, tax and amortization of at least 7.5 percent of revenues. Of its four core divisions, medical systems, domestic appliances and lighting were confident of reaching 2007 targets. However, the least-profitable business -- consumer electronics -- would struggle with market oversupply of flat TVs early in 2007. Competition was especially tough in mainstream flat TVs and not so much in high-end flat TVs, Kleisterlee said. "I wouldn't be overly obsessed with Consumer Electronics (CE). CE is not the division that makes or breaks the result of Philips. There, where it matters most, I have no concerns whatsoever," Kleisterlee said. The maker of shavers, televisions, lamps and x-ray machines, is the third diversified electronics conglomerate to publish results after rival Samsung Electronics from South Korea reported a 1 percent sales increase and General Electric from the United States saw sales increase by 11 percent. Philips owns large stakes in flat display supplier LG.Philips LCD and Taiwanese contract chip maker TSMC, which are jointly valued at 9.5 billion euros. It has said it will sell those stakes over time and look for takeovers, although it has not made massive moves like GE, which has announced takeovers worth $15 billion in recent weeks. Kleisterlee told a news conference that Philips may keep part of LG.Philips LCD as a strategic investment, just like its rivals Sony, Samsung and Sharp owned all or part of their LCD panel suppliers, but that its 32.9 percent shareholding valued at 2.7 billion euros should be reduced to a level which no longer had an significant impact on earnings. Philips did not say whether it planned more share buybacks, having purchased 3.3 billion euros worth of its own shares in 2006, nor did it mention takeover plans other than that it was talking to many parties and had sufficient opportunities. Kleisterlee said Philips had spent around 4 billion euros on more than half a dozen takeovers over the last 18 months. Analysts estimate Philips will generate around 15 billion euros of cash from disposals and operations over the next 12-24 months and it could also take on debt -- it is currently debt free. "We can absolutely leverage our balance sheet which we do not see as optimal at the moment," said Chief Financial Officer Pierre Jean Sivignon.
