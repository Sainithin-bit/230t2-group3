 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Computer maker Sun Microsystems Inc. will announce on Monday plans to use microprocessors from No. 1 chip maker Intel Corp., according to a source familiar with the situation, in what would be a blow to Intel's smaller rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc. 

 Under the agreement, Sun Microsystems SUNW.O will buy Intel's ( INTC.O ) Xeon chips to power its servers, in addition to AMD's ( AMD.N ) Opteron chips that Sun uses, the source said. Sun has scheduled a news conference for Monday morning at a San Francisco hotel but declined to give further details. An Intel spokesman declined to comment. Sun has used the Opteron chips over the past two to three years exclusively in its servers, because of what has been AMD's power and performance advantages over Intel until recently, analysts said. Servers are the workhorses of computer and carry far higher profit margins than do personal computers. With the pending announcement, Sun joins the three other large U.S. computer makers -- Dell Inc. DELL.O, Hewlett-Packard Co. ( HPQ.N ) and International Business Machines Corp. ( IBM.N ) -- in selling computers that use both AMD and Intel chips. "This would mark an almost final stage in terms of end users being able to buy servers with either Intel or AMD chips from every important supplier," said Nathan Brookwood, president of Silicon Valley consulting firm Insight64. Dell, which had only until recently used Intel chips, is now selling computers based on AMD's microprocessors, which are the central computing engines of computers. An AMD spokesman couldn't immediately be reached for comment. Sun will start buying Xeon chips that use Intel's Woodcrest chip design, the source said. The announcement will also involve Intel working to optimize Sun's Solaris operating system to run on Intel's Xeon chips. On Friday, Bank of American Equity Research analyst Sumit Dhanda wrote in a note to clients that his checks within the supply-chain in the technology industry indicated that Sun would start using Intel chips in servers that would be available to customers in late 2007. "Development is currently taking place at the engineering level, with expectations for volume production sometime in late 2007," Dhanda wrote. Although Sun is not as big a seller of computer servers now as it was in the late 1990s, its move to Intel chips is a shot in the arm to Intel, which has stumbled in the past several years and is now again producing competitive processors that are used in PCs and servers. "Intel has come back and has a very credible roadmap and product line and customers are asking for it," Brookwood said. For Intel Chief Executive Paul Otellini, it's the biggest customer win since Apple Inc. ( AAPL.O ) opted in 2005 to switch to Intel chips from those made by IBM. Apple has, over the years, as has Sun Microsystems, taken digs at Intel over what the two companies once said was lagging technology on Intel's part. Sun Chairman Scott McNealy has in the past referred to an Intel chip called Itanium as "Itanic", after that chip did not take off in the server market as Intel and its co-developer on Itanium, HP, had hoped. McNealy tapped protege Jonathan Schwartz in April 2006 to succeed him as chief executive, and in addition to the CEO title, Schwartz also holds the title of president. Since taking the reins, Schwartz has pushed Sun to sell the Solaris operating system more aggressively and has worked to offer its customers more choice in mixing and matching software, services and different types of computer hardware to boost financial results. "Although Sun is fairly small player in the x86 server market (No. 6 in market share), it has been one of the fastest growing vendors in this market over the past few quarters," Dhanda wrote.
