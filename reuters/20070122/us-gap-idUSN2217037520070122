 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Gap Inc. Chief Executive Paul Pressler, under pressure over the retailer's struggling sales and stock price, resigned effective immediately, the company said on Monday. 

 Nonexecutive chairman Robert Fisher will fill in on an interim basis. Pressure on Pressler had been mounting over the past year, and especially in recent weeks, as the iconic retailer of casual American apparel has failed to turn around disappointing sales. Many on Wall Street have speculated the company could spin off certain divisions, or be taken private. The company also said it still expects fiscal 2006 earnings to range between 83 cents to 87 cents per share. Since 2005, Gap has reported declines in sales at stores open at least a year -- a key measure of financial performance -- in every month except for two. "While this certainly opens up the speculation for a private equity/LBO possibility at Gap, still the company could very well go into a restructuring situation and hire a new CEO," said Arun Daniel, an analyst at ING Investment Management. Many retail watchers have questioned whether Pressler, who arrived at Gap in September 2002 after 15 years at Walt Disney Co., was the right person to lead the company since he lacked retail experience. During his tenure, Pressler focused on reducing debt, improving inventory controls, closing underperforming stores and adding technology to back up operations at its more than 3,000 worldwide stores. Despite internal problems, Gap shares rose 10 percent in 2006, helped by share buybacks. But at the end of 2006, the stock traded 7 percent below January 2005 levels. Shares of Gap rose about 3 percent in after-hours trading to $20.52 from a close of $19.90 on the New York Stock Exchange.
