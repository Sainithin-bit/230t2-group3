 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Video rental store operator Movie Gallery Inc. MOVI.O on Monday posted a third-quarter loss that nearly tripled from a year earlier, weighed down by charges for store closings, the company's restructuring and other items. 

 The company also said it had sufficient cash and loan availability to meet working capital needs. Movie Gallery said its loss was $36.1 million, or $1.13 a share, for the quarter that ended October 1, compared with $12.5 million, or 39 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue in the latest quarter rose 1.8 percent to $583.0 million, while revenue from stores open at least a year, a key measure of retail health, fell 0.4 percent. A 3 percent same-store revenue increase at Movie Gallery stores was offset by a decrease of 1.9 percent for Hollywood stores. The company, which said in November it was notified by Nasdaq that its delayed quarterly filing made it noncompliant with listing requirements, said it filed its report and is in full compliance with Nasdaq rules.
