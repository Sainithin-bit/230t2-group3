 LONDON  (Reuters) - Shares in European online gaming firms tumbled by as much as 9 percent on Monday following news U.S. prosecutors had launched a probe into Internet gambling. 

 The U.S. Department of Justice has demanded information from some of the world's biggest investment banks as part of the probe into companies such as Britain's PartyGaming, banking sources said. The move is the latest in a U.S. crackdown on online gaming, which began with the arrest of BETonSPORTS' Scottish Chief Executive David Carruthers in Texas last July. Analysts said U.S. prosecutors were now probably trying to target founders and senior executives of Internet gambling companies, just as they did with the arrests of two NETeller founders last week. Canadians Stephen Lawrence, 46, and John Lefebvre, 55, have been charged with handling billions of dollars in illegal gambling proceeds. Both face a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. "They're trying to make the founders sweat, as well as current management," said analyst Tejinder Randhawa at Evolution Securities. The legality of Internet gambling in the United States was ambiguous for many years, but it was effectively banned last October when President Bush signed legislation outlawing gaming financial transactions. The big stock market-listed companies pulled out just ahead of the ban, although some privately owned Web sites such as Bodog.com are still flouting the law. But investors fear the listed gaming giants could be targeted for taking wagers before the ban. CHILLING EFFECT Shares in PartyGaming, the world's biggest online gaming group, were down 6.5 percent by 1122 GMT, while rival Sportingbet was down 6 percent, Playtech was down 4.2 percent and 888 was down 1.7 percent. Austria's Bwin fell 0.8 percent. Lawyer Clive Gringras, head of Olswang's e-commerce unit, said the move would probably have a "chilling effect" on the industry amid fears other countries would follow the U.S. lead. "The only way an Internet company could really avoid risk and uncertainty would be to stop doing international business," he said. Sources said the Department of Justice had ordered the banks to hand over all e-mails, telephone records and documents connected with Internet gaming firms. "They seem to be on a mission," said Evolution's Randhawa. "Extradition requests are unlikely, but they're not impossible, given what happened to the NatWest Three," he added, referring to three UK bankers extradited to the U.S. on charges linked to collapsed energy giant Enron. Sunday newspapers reported that the DoJ had ordered 16 banks including HSBC, Deutsche Bank, Credit Suisse and Dresdner Kleinwort to pass on the information, with subpoenas issued three weeks ago . All four banks declined to comment. European gambling companies, including PartyGaming, took business from the United States for many years and argued until last October that U.S. federal law was ambiguous and made no reference to the Internet. But the Department of Justice always warned them off, saying the 1961 Wire Act, which outlawed telephone betting, could also be interpreted to include the Internet. "I would have thought the DoJ would have been more reticent, given that the legislation was ambiguous at best," said Olswang's Gringras.
