 RENO, Nevada  (Reuters) - San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank President Janet Yellen said on Monday that U.S. interest rates were high enough to cut inflation, but that risks have arisen from the robust labor market. 

 "Let me be clear that I do want inflation to move down, but I believe policy may now be well-positioned to foster exactly such an outcome while also giving due consideration to the risks to economic activity," Yellen said in a speech to the Joint Rotary Clubs of Reno and the East Bay. Yellen's remarks largely repeated comments she made in Arizona last week. The fed funds rate at 5.25 percent "is currently within the moderately restrictive range that appears appropriate" given "middling" economic growth and the still-uncertain inflation outlook, Yellen said. Recent lower readings on inflation have been encouraging, but are yet to show up in the data on a sustained basis, she said. Long lags between the Fed's policy actions and their impact on economic activity mean "it will still take some additional time for inflation to unwind." Those lags could be from several months to a couple of years, Yellen said. Financial markets assess that the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee will hold rates steady for several months. Yellen is not a voting member of the FOMC this year. Yellen spoke at length about the "puzzle" of the labor market "going gangbusters" while the economy is growing a bit below its long-term trend. There is even a possibility that the economy's long-run growth rate could be lower than many estimates, she said. "While I am inclined to see labor market tightness as transitory, I do see it as a serious risk," she said. "There are indeed large uncertainties -- and in particular, upside risks -- to the outlook for inflation." On balance, Yellen said the U.S. economy seems to be "on a glide path for the proverbial 'soft landing.'" In particular, worries about the weak housing market pulling the country into recession have been largely allayed, she said, adding that fears about plummeting housing prices have not played out on a national level. Consumer spending remains solid, and most sectors of the economy apart from housing are "pretty robust." (To access other stories on Fed policy click on <FED/AHEAD>)
