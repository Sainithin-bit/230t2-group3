 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Citigroup Inc. ( C.N ) Chief Financial Officer Sallie Krawcheck, one of Wall Street's most powerful women, is returning to her old job as head of wealth management, a job she was promoted from two years earlier. 

 Krawcheck, 42, replaces Todd Thomson, 45, who is leaving to pursue other interests, the largest U.S. bank said on Monday. Robert Druskin, who became chief operating officer last month, will run wealth management until Citigroup finds a new CFO. The move sends Krawcheck, Citigroup's highest-ranking woman and considered a potential future Wall Street chief executive, back to a job she had swapped in November 2004 for Thomson's job. Wealth management comprises the Smith Barney brokerage, research unit and private bank. In an interview, Chief Executive Charles Prince said he approached Krawcheck about a change "a number of weeks ago." He declined to discuss Thomson's departure, but said "my job is to put the best people into the right positions." Thomson, who joined Citigroup in 1998, was unavailable for comment, a bank spokesman said. Prince rejected suggestions he demoted Krawcheck, who is also head of strategy. Several analysts said Krawcheck's skills are better suited to running wealth management than being CFO. "It's clearly a promotion," Prince said. "From an operating standpoint, it's clearly a substantial step up from what she had before ... Anyone who thinks this is not a promotion is missing the boat." Krawcheck had been chief executive of Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. before joining Citigroup in 2002. Since she became CFO, Citigroup has struggled to manage interest-rate changes, like many banks, and had difficulty keeping costs down. "It's not a promotion if you think of it only as whether this puts her in line for CEO succession," said Henry Asher, president of Northstar Group Inc. "It's probably good for the company to put her in a unit that suits her talents." LAKE WOBEGON Wealth management is Citigroup's third-largest unit, after retail banking and corporate and investment banking, and accounts for about one-tenth of its business. Last quarter, it earned $411 million on revenue of $2.72 billion. Smith Barney accounts for roughly three-quarters of the unit's results. "People have talked about the Smith Barney unit being spun off," said Michael Holland, a money manager at Holland & Co. "They might start talking about it again." Before becoming CFO, Krawcheck was widely credited with restoring the luster of Smith Barney. Once home to the now disgraced analyst Jack Grubman, the unit was tarnished in the Wall Street scandal over biased stock research. "Citigroup had billed the swap as a promotion for Krawcheck and Thomson and now bills the switch back as a promotion for Krawcheck -- it's like Lake Wobegon, where everyone's moving up," said Craig Woker, an analyst at Morningstar Inc. "The real question becomes whether she still has anything to prove, and whether she sticks around." Krawcheck rejected rumors she was unhappy. "I have no plans (and) I never had any plans to leave Citigroup," she said in an interview. "I'm very committed to working with Chuck." She called being CFO "a terrific, terrific experience," yet added: "I have a lot more gray hair, which is the downside of it ... I'm a lot stronger for it, and I'm glad it's over." Citigroup shares closed up 18 cents at $54.68. REPLACEMENT Krawcheck's shift raised speculation that former Bank of America Corp. ( BAC.N ) CFO Alvaro de Molina might replace her as CFO. Prince said de Molina "doesn't look like" a CFO candidate, given his statements that he does not want a CFO job. De Molina declined to comment. In a December 1 interview, he called his CFO job "suffocating." Krawcheck's pay totaled $10.1 million in 2005, ranking her among Citigroup's top five executives, the bank said in March. Thomson was not among the top five. Another top woman executive at Citigroup, Marjorie Magner, stepped down as retail banking chief in 2005. On Monday, she said she launched a private equity firm with Robert Willumstad, who was Druskin's predecessor as COO. Citigroup is the third of the four largest U.S. banks to replace its CFO in the last year, joining Bank of America and Wachovia Corp. WB.N. (Additional reporting by  Dan Wilchins )
