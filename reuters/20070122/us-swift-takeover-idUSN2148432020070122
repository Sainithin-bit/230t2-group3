 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Trucking company Swift Transportation Co., Inc. SWFT.O has agreed to a raised takeover offer by an entity formed by Jerry Moyes, the company's founder and largest shareholder, in a deal worth $2.36 billion. 

 Moyes, a current director and former chairman and chief executive of Swift, will pay $31.55 per share, according to a press release issued late on Friday. That represents a premium of around 31 percent from Swift's closing stock price on November 3, the last trading day before Moyes's initial offer of $29 per share. Swift rejected the initial offer, saying on November 27 that the all cash bid was inadequate. The shares closed at $27.74 on Friday. Swift's Chairman Jock Patton, who also chaired the committee formed to consider the offer, said in a statement that Moyes's latest offer represents a "fair value for the Company and is in the best interest of all shareholders." Including debt, the all-cash deal is valued at around $2.74 billion. Moyes, who founded Swift in 1966, owns 27.1 percent of the company's outstanding shares, according to a Swift filing. The deal is expected to be completed during the second quarter of 2007. Moyes received commitments from Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ) for debt financing for the transaction. Goldman Sachs ( GS.N ) acted as financial adviser to Swift's special committee. Phoenix, Arizona-based Swift says it operates the largest fleet of truckload carrier equipment in the United States.
