 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Plane maker Boeing Co. ( BA.N ) said on Monday the airplane leasing unit of General Electric Co. ( GE.N ) ordered 39 planes valued at about $5.34 billion at list prices. 

 GE Commercial Aviation Services, or GECAS, one of the world's two leading aircraft leasing firms, will take delivery of 15 777 minijumbos and 24 single-aisle 737-800s between 2008 and 2010. The order was booked in 2006 but previously unidentified on Boeing's online order book. GECAS's order consists of seven 777-300ER (Extended Range) passenger jets and eight 777 Freighters, along with 24 737-800s. "We already have customers lined up for many of these aircraft," GECAS Chief Executive Henry Hubschman said in a statement. GECAS has a fleet of 1,450 aircraft that it leases to more than 230 airlines. It vies with International Lease Finance Corp., a unit of American International Group Inc. ( AIG.N ), as the world's biggest plane leasing company. Boeing outsold European rival Airbus ( EAD.PA ) last year for the first time since 2000. So far this year Boeing has taken new orders for only four commercial aircraft.
