 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The bankrupt parent of talk-radio network Air America is close to being bought by a group of investors led by a New York-area family, The Wall Street Journal reported on Monday, citing sources. 

 The French family of Westchester, New York, owner of New York City-area television concern WRNN, is leading a group of investors in a bid to buy the assets of Piquant LLC, the Journal reported, citing people familiar with the situation. An agreement could be announced as early today, it said. Air America launched in March 2004 as a talk-radio network designed as a liberal response to politically conservative shows by nationally syndicated hosts such as Rush Limbaugh. It included high-profile talent such as actress Janeane Garofalo, who has since left, and comedian Al Franken. Franken could leave if he decides to run for U.S. Senate in Minnesota, a move he is now evaluating, the Journal reported. Piquant filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in New York in October after talks with a creditor broke down. In a filing with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan at that time, Air America said it lost about $40.9 million since the spring of 2004, including $13.1 million in 2006. Claimants include RealNetworks Inc. ( RNWK.O ) Chief Executive Rob Glaser, the largest secured creditor with $9.8 million in claims, the Journal reported. Others include Citigroup Inc.'s ( C.N ) Citibank, with $2.5 million in unsecured debt, and Clear Channel Communications Inc. ( CCU.N ), with $558,333 in unsecured claims, the Journal also reported. Air America officials and the French family were not immediately available for comment.
