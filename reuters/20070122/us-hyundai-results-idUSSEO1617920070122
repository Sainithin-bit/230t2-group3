 SEOUL  (Reuters) - Hyundai Motor Co. ( 005380.KS ), South Korea's top auto maker, is expected to say on Thursday that its quarterly profit dropped 27 percent, hit by a firmer won and strike action that dented sales. 

 But the world's sixth-largest auto maker by sales along with affiliate Kia Motors Corp. ( 000270.KS ), should see earnings pick up this year as raw materials costs soften, car prices rise and overseas sales grow. The won is seen rising further, but not at last year's breakneck pace. Also, Hyundai, which controls almost half the local market, could face further labor disputes that could jeopardize a projected 9.4 percent increase in 2007 sales to 2.735 million vehicles. Last year, 33 days of strikes cost the company 115,124 vehicles in sales. "The fourth quarter profit probably suffered from weaker sales amid partial strikes, a stronger won and losses from derivatives related to Kia shares," said Kim Yong-soo, an auto analyst at SK Securities. "But the 2007 outlook is positive as the won is seen more stable at 930-940 (to the U.S. dollar). The company has been able to offset the impact of a firmer won through cost cuts." October-December net profit is forecast to fall to 482.6 billion won ($514.2 million), according to 10 analysts polled by Reuters, down from 656.8 billion won a year ago, and could include a 40-50 billion won loss from derivatives related to Kia shares, which fell 12.4 percent in the December quarter. In the 2005 fourth quarter, Hyundai booked a 138.5 billion won gain from derivatives related to Kia shares and a near 31 billion won one-time gain from a tax refund. Full-year 2007 net profit is seen rising 27 percent to 1.87 trillion won, according to 27 brokers polled by Reuters Estimates, against a 2006 forecast for 1.47 trillion won. Fourth-quarter sales are expected to have dipped 6.9 percent to 7.56 trillion won, from 8.12 trillion a year ago, when local buyers flocked to showrooms before tax benefits ended. Many analysts say Hyundai's 2007 sales target is aggressive, especially as consumer sentiment in Asia's third-largest economy remains weak and the company is short of new model launches. But sales in value terms should be boosted by increased sales of high-end vehicles. Hyundai's 2007 sales are expected to rise 7.7 percent to 29.59 trillion won, according to Reuters Estimates, though overseas sales may come under pressure amid competition with global rivals such as Toyota Motor Corp. ( 7203.T ) which is helped by a weaker Japanese yen  JPY= . The won  KRW=  on average rose 8.4 percent in October-December from a year earlier. Shares in Hyundai, valued at just over $15 billion, fell 16.8 percent in October-December, underperforming a 4.6 percent gain on South Korea's main KOSPI share index  .KS11 . The stock trades at just below 12 times forecast 2007 earnings, against Toyota's 16.3 times and Honda Motor Co. Ltd.'s ( 7267.T ) 15.6 times, according to Reuters data. ($1=938.5 Won)
