 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co. ( F.N ) is losing about $1 
billion annually from counterfeit auto parts, according to a 
study by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. 

  The figure was disclosed by Joe Wiegand, Ford's global 
brand protection manager, in the study that will be released on 
Wednesday.  Counterfeiting has health and safety ramifications and few 
means of effective remediation as, for example, legal actions 
are largely toothless outside the United States and Mexico, the 
study said.  "Many businesses, particularly small and medium-sized 
companies, do not fully appreciate the bottom-line cost of lax 
supply chain security and adverse impact it has on brand 
value," the study said.  Fake products costs companies like Ford by depriving then 
of revenue from genuine parts.  Consumers are also hurt because they are deceived into 
buying fake products that can pose health and safety hazards, 
according to the study, which also looked at counterfeiting 
problems for office equipment maker Xerox Corp. ( XRX.N ), drug 
company Merck & Co. Inc. ( MRK.N ), athletic shoe maker New 
Balance and auto parts supplier Bendix.
