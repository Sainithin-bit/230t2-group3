 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. mortgage giant Freddie Mac FRE.N on Tuesday named Bruce Witherell as its new chief operating officer, effective September 14. 

 Witherell, 49, was previously managing director and global co-head of the residential mortgage business at Morgan Stanley, Freddie Mac said in a statement. Prior to joining Morgan Stanley in 2006, he had a 15-year career with Lehman Brothers. Freddie Mac said that Witherell will oversee and ensure effective integration across the company's three business lines, as well as its operations and technology division. He will report to chief executive officer Charles Haldeman.
