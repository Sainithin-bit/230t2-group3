 ZURICH  (Reuters) - A tax agreement with the United States over Swiss bank UBS contains a new legal assistance request instead of unilateral measures, the Swiss government said on Wednesday. 

 "UBS case: New legal assistance request instead of unilateral measures," the Swiss government said on its website, announcing a press conference on the subject for 1330 GMT. The deal could help the world's second-largest wealth manager restore its image, which has been battered by the financial crisis and U.S. dispute, and may open the way for the Swiss government to sell its stake in UBS.
