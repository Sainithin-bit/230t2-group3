 LONDON  (Reuters) - U.S. shares were poised to follow European and Asian stocks down on Wednesday after a slump in Chinese shares and growing investor concerns over the sustainability of the global economic recovery. 

 Government bonds and the dollar firmed after the Shanghai composite index  .SSEC  slid 4 percent to a two-month closing low on disappointment that authorities were not taking steps to support the market amid heavy losses. It has fallen 20 percent since two weeks ago, rattling global markets. The S&P 500 futures index was down 0.9 percent while European shares  .FTEU3 , were 0.5 percent lower. They came slightly off session lows after data showed U.S. mortgage applications rose for the third week running last week, boding well for the hard-hit U.S. housing market. The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, was up 0.2 percent at 79.085 .DXY. The yen also gained broadly. "The fact that the declines in the Shanghai index are happening at the same time as G7 equities are falling is detrimental to risk appetite," CMC Markets analyst Ashraf Laidi said. "Because there are no major figures in the U.S. there is very little that could alter this negative tone in risk appetite." Oil and metal prices and cyclical currencies like the Australian dollar also fell as the sell-off in China gathered pace. V-SHAPED RECOVERY HOPES WANING The sharp reversal in China has badly shaken confidence, even though some form of correction had been widely expected after a rally in share prices stretching back to early March. "There is no sign that we can expect a V-shaped global recovery and the realization of this will take the heat out of the market. Earnings forecasts are still too high," said Heino Ruland, strategist at Ruland Research, in Frankfurt. Bank of Communications ( 3328.HK )( 601328.SS ), China's fifth-largest lender, will kick off first-half results for the country's financial sector on Wednesday. It will be followed by two of the world's biggest banks by market value -- Industrial and Commercial Bank of China ( 1398.HK )( 601398.SS ) and China Construction Bank ( 0939.HK )( 601939.SS ) -- later in the week. U.S. Treasury and euro zone government debt prices rose, pushing their yields lower. The benchmark U.S. 10-year T-note yield was down about 8 basis points at 3.439 percent while the 10-year Bund yield was three basis points lower on the day at 3.27 percent. British gilts got an extra lift but sterling fell broadly after minutes from the Bank of England's August meeting showed the Monetary Policy Committee was split over whether to up the amount of gilt purchases it makes by even more than it did. Six MPC members were in favor of the 50 billion pound ($82.33 billion) increase to 175 billion pounds, but three, including BoE Governor Mervyn King, wanted to bolster the program by 75 billion pounds.
