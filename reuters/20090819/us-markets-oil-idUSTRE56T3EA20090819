 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Oil surged more than 4 percent on Wednesday after U.S. government data showed a steep drop in crude imports and inventories in top consumer the United States. 

 U.S. crude stockpiles plunged by 8.4 million barrels in the week to August 14 -- against analysts' forecasts for a build -- as imports dropped to the lowest level since September 2008 and refiners hiked runs, according to data released by the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Analysts said the import drop may have been caused by companies holding more inventories in tankers offshore and waiting for higher prices before importing the extra crude. Gasoline inventories also showed a bigger-than-expected drop, while distillate stockpiles showed a surprise drop. "The data is being viewed as bullish as all stock categories fell more than expected," said Jim Ritterbusch, president of Ritterbusch & Associates in Galena, Illinois. U.S. crude settled up $3.23 at $72.42 a barrel. London Brent crude rose $2.22 to settle at $74.59 a barrel. The American Petroleum Institute (API) said U.S. oil demand in July showed signs of improvement, with demand down 3 percent year-on-year last month compared with an average drop of around 6 percent in the first half of 2009. "I think these (demand) changes are reflective of an improving economy, but one must be cautious because these changes are versus year-ago weak numbers," said API chief economist John Felmy. Slumping demand due to the global economic crisis sent crude oil prices off record high prices near $150 a barrel hit in July 2008 to below $33 a barrel in December. Expectations for a potential rebound in the economy could increase fuel consumption and have already helped lift prices. Oil prices fell earlier on Wednesday, hitting a low of $68.05 after a near 5 percent slump in Chinese shares sent doubts rippling through global markets about the strength of the world economic recovery. U.S. stocks rose as energy shares jumped following the EIA data, while the dollar fell. Traders also watched for storms in the Atlantic Basin but there no immediate threat was seen to U.S. oil installations in the Gulf of Mexico. Powerful Hurricane Bill, a dangerous Category 4 storm with 135 mph winds, raged across the open Atlantic on Wednesday, days from land but on a path that could menace Canada's eastern province next week.
