 ZURICH  (Reuters) - The Swiss government will hand over details of about 4,450 bank accounts to U.S. authorities as part of a deal struck with Washington over UBS, it said on Wednesday. 

 "In the UBS case, the United States will submit a new treaty request to Switzerland and will withdraw the John Doe summons that demands disclosure of the identity of 52,000 UBS accounts holders," the Swiss government said in a statement. "In return, Switzerland has undertaken to process a new treaty request, concerning approximately 4,450 accounts, within a year." (Reporting by  Sam Cage  and  Jason Rhodes )
