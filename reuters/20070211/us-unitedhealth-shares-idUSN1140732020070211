 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - UnitedHealth Group Inc. ( UNH.N ), recovering from an options-trading scandal, could see its stock rise more than 40 percent in the next 12 to 24 months, as its underlying operations shine, a report said. 


 With sales and profits up smartly, shares of UnitedHealth, which closed on Friday at $50.88 on the New York Stock Exchange, could climb to the 70s within two years, Barron's said in its edition of February 12. Although UnitedHealth cut its revenue estimate for 2007 last week, the company continues to target annual revenue growth of 10 percent and earnings growth of 15 percent over the long term, Barron's said. Operating cash flow, because of the company's insurance and medical-services businesses, could top $6 billion this year, the report said. Once the company's regulatory filings are current, UnitedHealth is expected to launch an aggressive stock-buyback program of up to $6 billion, it said. For all its maladies, the company's $2.6 billion in net cash is likely to absorb any fines or accrued taxes the company is likely to owe, Barron's said.
