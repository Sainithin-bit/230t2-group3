 HOUSTON  (Reuters) - Oilfield services company Halliburton 
Co. ( HAL.N ) said on Sunday it is committed to doing business in 
Venezuela, in an effort to clarify some comments its chief 
financial officer made earlier to investors. 


  "Halliburton is proud of its more than 60-year history in 
Venezuela, and is committed to continuing to build upon a 
strong reputation and operations in the country," the company 
said in a statement released via e-mail. "We will continue 
working closely with PDVSA (Venezuela's state oil company) to 
ensure our operations are aligned with its business objectives 
and to demonstrate our commitment to its future programs."  On Thursday, Halliburton's chief financial officer, 
Christopher Gaut, told investors at a Credit Suisse Group 
meeting in Vail, Colorado, that his company and others were 
closely watching the political situation in Venezuela following 
President Hugo Chavez' plans to take control of some of the 
country's oil projects.  Among other comments, Gaut told the investors that 
Halliburton would be carefully managing its exposure in 
Venezuela, and it was unlikely a lot of new cash would be 
deployed in the region.  Halliburton said Gaut's remarks were "misconstrued" on 
Friday by the press in Venezuela.  Chavez has vowed to strip controlling stakes held by firms 
like BP ( BP.L ), Chevron Corp. ( CVX.N ) and Exxon Mobil Corp. 
( XOM.N ) in the heavy oil projects of the country's Orinoco belt 
by May 1.  Halliburton provides drilling services to companies like 
Petrozuata operating in the Orinoco belt. It first entered that 
market in 1940.
