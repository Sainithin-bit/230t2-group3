 SYDNEY  (Reuters) - An $8.7 billion takeover bid for Australia's Qantas Airways Ltd. ( QAN.AX ) by a consortium led by Macquarie Bank Ltd. MBL.AX is fair and reasonable, an independent expert said on Monday. 


 Qantas said its board unanimously recommends that shareholders accept the offer. In a statement issued by the airline, the independent expert said the offer price of A$5.60 a share is within its valuation range of A$5.18 to A$5.98 and any offer above the bottom of that range would be fair value. Qantas shares slipped 0.2 percent to A$5.36 in early trade. The consortium, Airline Partners Australia (APA), also includes private equity firm Texas Pacific Group TPG.UL, Allco Equity Partners AEQ.AX, Allco Finance Group AFG.AX and Canadian investment firm Onex Corp. ( OCX.TO ). Last week Qantas raised its annual profit forecast for the third time in six months, helped by easing fuel prices and increased demand for travel. Qantas shareholders have until March 9 to vote for the offer from Airline Partners. The consortium last week lodged an application with the Australian government's Foreign Investment Review Board to review the takeover.
