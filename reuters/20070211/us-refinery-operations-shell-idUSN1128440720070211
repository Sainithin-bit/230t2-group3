 HOUSTON  (Reuters) - Shell Oil Co. said on Sunday operations were back to normal at its 156,000-barrel-per-day San Francisco Bay area refinery in Martinez, California, after emergency flaring on Friday. 


 The refinery carried out an emergency depressurization of equipment at the refinery on Friday night, according to a notice filed with the California Office of Emergency Services. Refinery spokesman Steve Lesher declined to identify the unit depressurized on Friday but said operations on that unit were back to normal on Sunday. Annual maintenance work continues on other units at the refinery, Lesher said. Shell is the U.S. unit of Royal Dutch Shell ( RDSa.L ).
