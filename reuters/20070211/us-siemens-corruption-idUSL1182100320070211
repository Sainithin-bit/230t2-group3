 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Siemens ( SIEGn.DE ) Chief Executive Klaus Kleinfeld ruled out in a newspaper interview any prospect that he would resign over a corruption affair at the German conglomerate. 


 He told the Bild newspaper, in an interview to be published on Monday, that he did "not even for a second" consider giving up his position at Siemens. German prosecutors are investigating 200 million euros ($259.8 million) missing from Siemens's accounts that it suspects were transferred into foreign accounts and used as slush funds for bribes to win telecoms equipment contracts. Siemens is also conducting its own internal investigation into 420 million euros of dubious payments that were booked as consultancy fees over a seven-year period. In the interview, Kleinfled denied knowledge of alleged bribe payments. He has also denied to other German media any knowledge that his company was paying bribes in exchange for contracts. Kleinfeld refrained from commenting on new accusations that Siemens knew about corruption at the company in 2003. The Sueddeutsche Zeitung reported on Saturday that Siemens had information more than three years ago that the company was paying bribes. "You have to understand please that I cannot talk about current proceedings. I myself lived until the end of 2003 as the boss of Siemens USA in New York." He added in the interview: "We do not tolerate illegal business practices and that is not negotiable." Kleinfeld also said he finds criticism of Siemens supervisory board chief Heinrich von Pierer over the corruption affair unjustified. "Heinrich von Pierer has from the first day contributed fully to the clearing up (of the affair). There is nothing to accuse him of in this affair." The corruption affair has prompted repeated calls for the resignation of von Pierer, who was also chief executive of Siemens until the beginning of 2005.
