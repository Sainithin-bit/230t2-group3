 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Shares of Costco Wholesale Corp. ( COST.O ) are not cheap, but gains for the largest U.S. warehouse club operator are far from over, according to a report. 


 Patient investors could be rewarded because the company is an industry leader with top-notch management, a loyal customer base and solid growth prospects at home and abroad, Barron's said in its February 12 edition. Costco's valuation may be understated because of its conservative treatment of depreciation, and it has some of the key characteristics private equity firms seek, Barron's said. Costco has a strong balance sheet, predictable cash flow and a durable franchise. Costco has $2 billion in net cash and it owns 78 percent of its stores, which could generate several billion dollars in proceeds through sales and lease-backs, Barron's said.
