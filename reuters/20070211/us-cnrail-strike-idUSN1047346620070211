 MONTREAL  (Reuters) - Canadian National Railway Co. ( CNR.TO ) ( CNI.N ) said on Saturday that 2,800 of its conductors and yard-service workers at its operations in Canada began a strike, a work stoppage that could affect the country's key shipments of grain, timber and other commodities. 


 CN, Canada's largest railway, said it was putting management personnel on trains and in switching yards to continue freight operations across Canada because of the strike by members of the United Transportation Union (UTU). CN said the strike is restricted to Canada and its other unionized employees remain at work. Grain industry sources told Reuters last week that a rail strike would likely have a significant effect on Canadian wheat exports but little effect on canola shipments. Wheat export shipments at Vancouver and Prince Rupert ports in British Columbia had already been delayed by at least 10 to 14 days over the past month because of windy storms, mud slides, cold weather, rail washouts and lower rail capacity. CN said it was ready to negotiate with the UTU at any time, but the company was seeking to have the strike declared illegal because CN said it had been informed that the certified bargaining agent of the UTU members employed at the rail company had not authorized the walkout. "We have the resources -- and the resolve -- to run the railway with management personnel filling strikers' jobs for as long as it takes to reach an economically sound settlement with the UTU," Hunter Harrison, president and chief executive officer of CN, said in a statement early on Saturday. The UTU said the conductors were in a legal strike position under Canadian law even though the president of U.S.-based UTU International had not authorized the walkout. "This fact does not effect the legality of the strike," UTU said. CN and the UTU have agreed during the conductors' strike to maintain normal commuter rail operations on CN lines in Toronto and Montreal. VIA Rail, Canada's national passenger train service, said it was unaffected by the CN strike. ($1=$1.19 Canadian)
