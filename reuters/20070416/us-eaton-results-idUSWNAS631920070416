 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Diversified manufacturer Eaton Corp. ( ETN.N ) posted a better-than-expected 12.5 percent first-quarter profit gain on strong demand across its businesses and raised its full-year outlook on Monday, sending its shares to an all-time high. 

 But Eaton, whose products range from electrical power distribution and control equipment to engine parts and hydraulic and fluid power systems, also still expects a 3 to 4 percent sales decline in the industrial markets it serves. The company attributed the decline mainly to the North American heavy-duty truck market, which it expects to be slightly weaker for the balance of the year after it was stronger than expected at the start. Net income in the first quarter rose to $234 million, or $1.56 a share, from $208 million, or $1.36 a share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, earnings were $1.62 a share, beating the analysts' average forecast of $1.41 compiled by Reuters Estimates. The strength in the truck business helped Eaton beat the midpoint of its prior first-quarter forecast by 22 cents a share, Merrill Lynch analyst Andrew Obin said in a research note. Of that, 15 cents came from operations and 7 cents from a lower-than-expected tax rate. By raising its full-year outlook by only 15 cents, however, the company effectively lowered its view for the rest of the year, implying no upside from the fluid power and electrical segments, said Obin, who has a "neutral" rating on the stock. STRONGER OFFSETS WEAKER Eaton's markets were helped by stronger-than-expected conditions in the North American heavy-duty truck and Brazilian agricultural equipment markets, Eaton Chief Executive Alexander Cutler said. That was offset by weaker conditions in the North American markets for residential electrical equipment and hydraulics. "By any measure, a very strong quarter, not only on shipments and profits, but also in terms of bookings," he told Reuters in a telephone interview. Cutler said the recovery of U.S. industrial production is happening a little slower than expected but that it should still occur later this year. "The big macro news is the same. The real good news is that in that same environment, we were able to do significantly better, and that's why we've raised our guidance for this year by 15 cents, which is a pretty bullish thing to do this early in the year," he said. Eaton expects the Federal Reserve Bank to raise interest rates by a quarter-point only once later this year instead of the two hikes it had predicted in January, Cutler said on a conference call. It still expects the markets it serves to rebound next year to a 5 percent growth rate. Quarterly sales rose 5.4 percent to $3.15 billion, above the $3.05 billion analysts had expected. The Cleveland-based company raised its full-year profit outlook to a range of $6.20 to $6.40 a share on a net basis and $6.45 to $6.65 before one-time items. For the second quarter, Eaton sees earnings of $1.35 to $1.45 a share on a net basis and $1.40 to $1.50 before items. Analysts were expecting profits before one-time items of $6.23 a share for the year and $1.42 for the second quarter. For Eaton's electrical business, the company's largest segment, sales rose 12 percent in the first quarter to $1.1 billion and operating profit increased 16 percent due to strong demand in nonresidential markets. Fluid power segment sales rose 7 percent to $1 billion, and operating profit jumped 20 percent. Sales in the truck segment fell 5 percent and operating profit declined 9 percent. North American heavy-duty truck production fell 23 percent, but that was less than expected and Eaton raised its full-year outlook by 10,000 units to a range of 215,000 to 220,000. In the automotive business, sales rose 2 percent, and Eaton expects the combined 2007 North American and European auto markets to fall slightly from last year. Shares of Eaton hit an all-time intraday high of $88.90 and were still up $2.35, or 2.8 percent, at $87.51 in afternoon New York Stock Exchange trade.
