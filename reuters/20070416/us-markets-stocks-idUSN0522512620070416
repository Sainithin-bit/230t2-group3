 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rallied on Monday, completing their recovery from a late February sell-off, as Citigroup Inc. reported better-than-expected results, student lender Sallie Mae agreed to be bought and upbeat retail data suggested the economy remained resilient. 

 The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose to a 6-1/2-year high and the Dow climbed to within 75.5 points of its record high set on February 20. Shares of Citigroup ( C.N ), the largest U.S. financial institution, led advances in both the S&P 500 and the Dow. Wachovia Corp. WB.N, the fourth-largest U.S. bank, also gained after posting results that beat expectations. Data showing a slightly stronger-than-expected rise in March retail sales helped fuel the advance.

"The market has been anticipating the bubble to burst on the consumer front with mortgage problems, but that's not the case," said Andre Bakhos, president of Princeton Financial Group in Princeton, New Jersey. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  climbed 108.33 points, or 0.86 percent, to end at 12,720.46 -- not far below its lifetime high of 12,795.93. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  shot up 15.62 points, or 1.08 percent, to finish at 1,468.47. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  gained 26.39 points, or 1.06 percent, to close at 2,518.33. The day's advance and recovery from the steep global sell-off on February 27, which was sparked by a sharp drop in China's main stock index, reflected a better appetite for equities around the world. Overseas, the FTSEurofirst 300 index  .FTEU3  closed at its highest level since December 2000. Major stock indexes in Brazil, Mexico and Argentina hit record highs. BETTING ON SALLIE MAE SLM Corp. SLM.N, better known as Sallie Mae, said it had accepted a $25 billion takeover bid from two private-investment funds along with two big U.S. banks -- JPMorgan Chase & Co. ( JPM.N ) and Bank of America Corp. ( BAC.N ) SLM Corp.'s shares rose 18.4 percent to $55.35 and ranked as the second-biggest percentage gainer on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock climbed as high as $55.50, its best level in a little over a year. Citigroup said first-quarter profit fell 11 percent. But results nevertheless topped analysts' forecasts, helped by surging trading gains and signs that Chief Executive Charles Prince's efforts to rein in costs are beginning to bear fruit. <ID:nN16354392>. Citigroup's stock rose 2.6 percent to $52.93. Trading revenue was a key driver in Citigroup's results, the company said. The Amex Securities Broker Dealer index .XBD rose 3.3 percent in its best day since March 21. Shares of Wachovia gained 2 percent to $55.06. RETAIL SALES UP, CPI AHEAD In addition to the rise in retail sales in March, the government revised February sales sharply upward in a sign of strength in consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of economic growth. The S&P retail index .RLX rose 1.3 percent. On Tuesday, Consumer Price Index data for March is expected. The CPI report could give investors some clues on the outlook for interest rates. DOUBLE SHOT OF GOOGLE DEALS On Nasdaq, shares of Google Inc. ( GOOG.O ), the Web company, rose. Google has a multiyear advertising sales agreement with the largest U.S. broadcaster, Clear Channel Radio, the companies said on Sunday. <ID:nN15238629> Google also said on Friday it will acquire DoubleClick Inc., an online advertising network. Google's stock gained 1.7 percent to $474.27 on the Nasdaq. Also on Nasdaq, shares of Amazon.com Inc. ( AMZN.O ) surged 6.6 percent to $45.20 after Deutsche Bank raised its rating on the Internet retailer's shares. Volume was moderate on the NYSE, where about 1.56 billion shares changed hands, well below last year's estimated daily average of 1.84 billlion. On Nasdaq, about 1.86 billion shares traded, below last year's daily average of 2.02 billion. Advancers outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by a ratio of about 3 to 1, while on the Nasdaq, more than two stocks rose for every one that fell. (Additional reporting by  Ellis Mnyandu )
