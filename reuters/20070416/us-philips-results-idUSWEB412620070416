 AMSTERDAM  (Reuters) - Dutch Philips Electronics beat analysts' forecasts on Monday with first-quarter operating profit, but sales were below expectations due to slower TV and monitor sales as well as Latin American weakness. 

 Philips's earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) came in at 292 million euros ($395.6 million) compared with an average forecast of 267 million euros by 15 analysts polled by Reuters. EBIT in the year-earlier period was 335 million euros. Revenues fell more than expected to 5.99 billion euros from 7.37 billion euros a year earlier, and compared with an average analyst forecast of 6.14 billion euros. Philips has shifted investment to more stable and higher-margin business areas such as lighting, medical systems and domestic appliances, even as marginally profitable consumer electronics (CE) still generates almost 40 percent of revenues. Sales and profits were hit by the sale of the company's semiconductor business late last year, and on a comparable basis EBIT increased by 46 million euros. Philips felt confident enough to reiterate its full-year outlook for total sales growth of 5 to 6 percent and EBIT margin of 7.5 percent before amortization charges, and even said its home and personal appliances unit DAP and its lighting division could exceed their medium-term sales growth targets. DAP reinforced its world-leading position in electrical shavers with new products and increased comparable sales by 17 percent as EBIT profit amounted to 104 million euros against a forecast 66 million. "These results support the case Philips is trying to convey that earnings have become more stable, even with a little headwind," said analyst Eric de Graaf at broker Petercam. Group net profit was 875 million euros, boosted by the 733 million-euro sale of shares in Taiwanese chip maker TSMC, and compared with an average forecast of 833 million. MEDICAL SYSTEMS DISAPPOINT Consumer electronics made an operating profit of 34 million euros, against an average analyst forecast of 30 million euros. Higher sales of flat TVs, subject to price pressure, could not make up for slower cathode-ray tube TV and PC monitor sales. Sales of tube TVs in Brazil, in particular, disappointed. Philips's results were also hit by a loss of 48 million euros from unconsolidated companies, mainly due to flat-display supplier LG.Philips LCD, of which Philips owns around 30 percent and which published a loss due to overcapacity in panels. "For Q2, little change is anticipated in the trading conditions in the global consumer electronics marketplace," Philips said. The maker of shavers, televisions, lamps and X-ray machines, is the third major electronics company to publish results after rival Samsung Electronics from South Korea reported a slightly bigger-than-expected 15 percent profit drop, and General Electric from the United States saw sales increase 5.7 percent and earnings rise 1.5 percent. The Dutch company's closely watched medical systems division saw EBIT slip to 56 million euros, against an average analyst expectation of 98 million euros, as one-off charges and acquisition costs hit profit. Comparable sales increased 3 percent, against flat revenues at rival GE, but orders for new equipment slipped by 1 percent. "The only disappointment was medical systems," said Petercam analyst De Graaf. Philips Chief Financial Officer Pierre-Jean Sivignon said all four core business units were on track to achieve their 2007 sales and profit targets, and told reporters medical equipment orders would turn positive in the second quarter compared with the first quarter and the year-earlier quarter. Philips shares rose 2 percent to 29.92 euros by 0715 GMT, against a 0.7 percent higher European technology index. As Philips has abandoned the volatile chip sector, the stock is up almost 10 percent over the last 12 months -- outperforming the Eurotech index which is down 6 percent.
