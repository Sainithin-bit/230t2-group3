 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Watch, a group that monitors retailer Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ( WMT.N ), said that a national poll conducted in February and March showed that since 2005, the retailer's favorability rating has dropped to 71 percent from 76 percent. 

 It said that 27 percent of respondents reported developing a more negative opinion of Wal-Mart over the past year, compared with 11 percent for Target Corp. ( TGT.N ) and 4 percent for Costco Wholesale Corp. ( COST.O ) during the same time period. The poll found that 11 percent of Wal-Mart shoppers say they have shopped at Wal-Mart less because of its business and labor practices. The poll also found that 71 percent of respondents viewed the company favorably and 70 percent reported shopping at the store at least once a month.
