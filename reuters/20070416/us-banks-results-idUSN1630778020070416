 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Citigroup Inc. ( C.N ) and Wachovia Corp. WB.N, the first major U.S. banks to report quarterly results, posted higher-than-expected profits on Monday, helped by keeping operating costs down. 

 Citigroup, the largest U.S. bank, reported an 11 percent drop in first-quarter profit, but earnings rose 4 percent excluding a charge related to 17,000 job cuts as revenue from securities trading soared. Wachovia, the fourth-largest bank, said profit rose 33 percent, helped by the acquisition of mortgage lender Golden West Financial Corp. Results provided solace to investors who expected many banks to report mediocre results. Lending margins are narrowing and credit losses are rising, especially among lenders exposed to "subprime" and other riskier mortgages. "A lot of people were expecting bank earnings to be terrible," said Kevin Fitzsimmons, an analyst at Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP in New York. "It may mean the fundamentals weren't deteriorating as badly as we thought, or that good operators can perform well in a tough environment." Citigroup shares closed up $1.33, or 2.6 percent, at $52.93, while Wachovia rose $1.06, or 2 percent, to $55.06. The 24-member Philadelphia KBW Bank Index .BKX rose 2 percent. Other banks and thrifts to report this week include Wells Fargo & Co. ( WFC.N ) and Washington Mutual Inc. ( WM.N ) on Tuesday, JPMorgan Chase & Co. ( JPM.N ) on Wednesday and Bank of America Corp. ( BAC.N ) on Thursday. "The subprime debacle (may) have a more pronounced effect on smaller and mid-cap banks, where real estate and residential mortgages are a bigger part of their businesses," said Marshall Front, chairman of Front Barnett Associates LLC in Chicago. CITIGROUP Net income at New York-based Citigroup fell to $5.01 billion, or $1.01 per share, from $5.64 billion, or $1.12 per share, a year earlier. Excluding an $871 million restructuring charge, profit totaled $1.18 per share. That beat the average analysts' forecast of $1.10, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue rose 15 percent to $25.46 billion, while operating expenses, excluding the charge, rose just 6 percent. That suggests that Chief Executive Charles Prince is heeding investor calls and reining in costs. "These were excellent results, much better than expected," said Steve Roukis, managing director at Matrix Asset Advisors Inc. in New York, which invests $1.7 billion. Excluding items in both periods, Prince said revenue rose 12 percent and costs increased 10 percent. "It feels very good to me to see that progress," he said on a conference call. Assets shot past $2 trillion for the first time, ending at $2.02 trillion. Soaring trading revenue helped boost corporate and investment banking profit 36 percent, to $2.62 billion. "It was an amazing quarter in capital markets," said Adam Compton, head of U.S. financials research at RCM Global Investors. The consumer unit, Citigroup's largest business, continued to struggle, as profit fell 14 percent to $2.63 billion, while revenue rose 10 percent to $13.11 billion. Chief Financial Officer Gary Crittenden said Citigroup repurchased $645 million of stock in the quarter, but plans no more buybacks this year given its recent pace of acquisitions and "opportunities we see ahead." WACHOVIA Net income at Charlotte, North Carolina-based Wachovia rose to $2.3 billion, or $1.20 per share, from $1.73 billion, or $1.09, a year earlier. Excluding merger costs, profit was $2.31 billion, or $1.20 per share, topping the average forecast by 4 cents per share. Revenue rose 17 percent to $8.24 billion, while operating expenses increased 8 percent to $4.59 billion. Revenue fell 4 percent from the fourth quarter, but costs declined 7 percent. Wachovia plans in 2007 to finish a cost-cutting drive that may save $1 billion annually. Keeping costs down is "in our DNA now," Chief Executive Ken Thompson said on a conference call. The bank said it is "on track" in integrating Golden West, which it bought for $24.2 billion on October 1, though Thompson admitted "it's a trying time to be a participant in the mortgage market." In an interview, Chief Financial Officer Tom Wurtz said "we've clearly taken credit quality off the table" at Golden West, which may generate "negligible" credit losses in 2007.
