 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo's office on Monday said Education Finance Partners, a lender accused of paying kickbacks to 60 colleges that referred students to its loans, agreed to pay $2.5 million to resolve the state's investigation into its practices. 

 The San Francisco-based lender did not admit wrongdoing, but will pay $2.5 million into a fund that will educate students about financial aid and will agree to stop making payments to schools for loan referrals. Education Finance officials could not be reached immediately for comment. Last month Cuomo announced he would take Education Finance to court, the first legal action arising from a six month investigation into the $85 billion a year student loan industry. The probe, which has revealed unseemly financial dealings between loan companies and schools, has expanded to at least six lenders and about 100 universities and colleges across the United States. These arrangements create a conflict of interest, since schools are motivated to steer students to lenders who offer the most generous payments and not necessarily the best deal for students. Schools typically created a select list of "preferred lenders," which were chosen by students 90 percent of the time, Cuomo said. Cuomo blasted Education Finance's revenue sharing program, in which it paid schools a percentage of the private loan business generated by the students they referred. Recipients named by Cuomo's office include such well-known schools as Boston University, Clemson University, Drexel University, Duquesne University and St. John's University. The closely held student lender, based in San Francisco, is the third lender to settle since Cuomo announced his office had uncovered a series of deceptive and possibly unlawful practices. SLM Corp. -- the largest student lender, better known as Sallie Mae -- and Citigroup during the past two weeks both reached $2 million settlements with the New York attorney general's office. Like these two companies, Education Finance Partners will adopt Cuomo's code of conduct that bans kickbacks to schools, as well as gifts and other perks to financial aid officers. In recent weeks, attorneys general in Connecticut, Illinois, Ohio and other states have launched their own investigations into student lenders. Fallout from the probe also has reached Washington, where U.S. Education Department officials are under fire for law oversight of lending programs and lenders now face scrutiny from lawmakers.
