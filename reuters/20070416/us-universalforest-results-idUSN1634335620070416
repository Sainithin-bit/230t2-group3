 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Universal Forest Products Inc. ( UFPI.O ) said on Monday that first-quarter profit fell almost 75 percent because of soft lumber and housing markets, as well as adverse weather conditions. 

 Net earnings were $3.9 million, or 20 cents per share, compared with $15.9 million, or 82 cents per share, a year ago, the Grand Rapids, Michigan-based company said. Sales fell to $549.0 million from $665.6 million in the unusually strong first quarter of 2006, when there were more orders for manufactured homes from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) following the 2005 hurricane season. Analysts on average were expecting earnings of 45 cents and revenue of $581.9 million, according to Reuters Estimates. "We predicted that the housing market would be soft, but it turned out to be even weaker than we anticipated," said President and Chief Executive Officer Michael Glenn. "In addition, supply continues to exceed demand in an already depressed lumber market, keeping prices low and adversely affecting our sales numbers. "These factors combined to create a tough quarter." Glenn noted that January and February were as weak as the company has seen, but as the weather improved in March, sales and profits also rebounded. "March provided us with reason to believe we might soon see positive evidence of our efforts to gain market share," he said. Looking ahead, Universal Forest Products said its annual targets for unit sales growth ranging from 10 percent to 15 percent and net earnings growth of 5 percent to 10 percent are subject to a number of assumptions. "Due to the seasonality of our business and to other market factors that might impact our year-end results, it is too early to assess the relative accuracy and scope of those assumptions," the company said.
