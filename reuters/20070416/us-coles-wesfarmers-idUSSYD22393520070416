 SYDNEY  (Reuters) - Wesfarmers Ltd. WES.AX, battling for control of retailer Coles Group Ltd. CGJ.AX in Australia's biggest takeover bid, reiterated that its A$19.7 billion ($16 billion) offer was compelling, but did not say if it would raise it. 

 Wesfarmers Chief Executive Richard Goyder told ABC Television on Sunday he was also worried that if Coles' supermarket rival Woolworths Ltd. ( WOW.AX ) entered into the due diligence process, it may gain information that could hurt Coles. "We think we've put forward a compelling offer that can be implemented quickly," Goyder said, adding he was not going to discuss whether the offer was final. The Perth-based financial services and industrial conglomerate emerged as a surprise bidder for Coles, Australia's No.2 retailer, which put itself up for sale after a restructuring failed to close the gap with market leader Woolworths. Wesfarmers faces a rival bid for Coles from a private equity consortium led by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts KKR.UL, which has said it could better the conglomerate's offer. The KKR group includes Bain, CVC CVC.UL, Blackstone Group BG.UL, Carlyle Group CYL.UL and TPG TPG.UL. Local media has also reported that British retailer Tesco Plc. ( TSCO.L ) may be planning a bid for Coles. Woolworths is expected to make a bid for Coles' Target discount store chain and Officeworks office supplies businesses. It would be not be able to compete for the core supermarkets business because of competition concerns. Goyder said he was concerned over any move by Woolworths, which has said it has sufficient funds to make a number of acquisitions, but has declined to comment on Coles. "We would have concerns if Woolworths was able to get information on property and systems that would impact on operations at Everyday Needs," Goyder said, referring to Coles' core supermarket operations. Goyder also said he saw returns from Target and Officeworks exceeding Wesfarmers' hurdle rates, while he was looking at strong returns from Everyday Needs. Under its proposal, Wesfarmers would own 50 percent of the core businesses, with the remainder held by its consortium partners: private equity firms Pacific Equity Partners (PEP) and Permira and Macquarie Bank Ltd. MBL.AX. Goyder declined to say if Wesfarmers would ever hold 100 percent of Coles.
