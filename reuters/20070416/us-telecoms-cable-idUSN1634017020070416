 LAS VEGAS  (Reuters) - The head of the National Association of Broadcasters took a swipe at the U.S. cable industry on Monday, saying it was taking broadcasters' valuable programming away from consumers. 

 With the transition to digital airwaves, broadcasters will be able to offer additional channels, known as "multicasting." So far, the Federal Communications Commission has allowed a broadcaster to force cable companies such as Comcast Corp. ( CMCSA.O ) to carry its primary signal. But broadcasters want cable companies to be required to carry all channels. "When people hear about multicasting, they assume that the cable companies have to cut their channels to accept ours," the president of the National Association of Broadcasters, David Rehr, said at the group's annual conference. "This is not a case where the pie is only so big and we want to eat the cable companies' slices. Through the magic of compression technology, we are making the pie bigger by adding extra slices, extra programming," he said. "The cable companies intend to strip out our new programming because we're in competition." A proposal to force cable companies to carry broadcasters' extra digital channels failed to move forward last year amid stiff opposition from the cable industry. "Cable operators already carry hundreds of local broadcast high definition signals as a result of marketplace agreements and not government mandates," said Brian Dietz, spokesman for the National Cable & Telecommunications Association. "Since more than 85 percent of consumers subscribe to a pay TV service, cable operators are helping broadcasters by providing their signal to millions more viewers who wouldn't otherwise see it." Earlier this year, FCC chairman Kevin Martin floated an idea to make it possible for small and independently owned businesses to lease television spectrum from broadcasters, which he said would promote diversity in the industry. Last week, sources said Martin was circulating a proposal that would force cable companies to carry both analog and new digital signals by early 2009 to ensure viewers are unaffected when U.S. broadcasters are forced to go digital by February 17, 2009. The cable industry opposes the proposal. But the National Association of Broadcasters has a different view. "They are ripping out our data, taking our valuable programming away from consumers," said Rehr. "We're not asking to take someone else's property or programming. We're simply asking that the cable companies not take ours. We're simply asking that they do not take the anti-competitive step of stripping out our signals." In the same address, Rehr acknowledged the broadcasting industry needed to rebrand itself and that some of its terminology has become "clunky" and "outdated." He recounted a time when a lawmaker questioned what was terrestrial radio, better known as over-the-air radio. "Terrestrial radio sounds like it either involves aliens or is something from a bygone time, which we are not," Rehr added.
