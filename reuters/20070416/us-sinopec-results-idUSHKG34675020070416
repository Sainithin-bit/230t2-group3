 HONG KONG  (Reuters) - Top Asian oil refiner Sinopec Corp. ( 0386.HK ) beat forecasts with a more than two-fold jump in quarterly earnings as falling oil prices helped its refining arm turn around, and it flagged a 50 percent surge in first-half profit. 

 Now with oil prices likely to hold steady or even soften this year, investors foresee double-digit net profit growth for Sinopec in 2007. But its fortunes also hinge on whether Beijing allows it to charge more for refined products. State-run Sinopec said this month it expected net profit to rise more than half in the first quarter -- but based on Chinese accounting standards -- after its refining arm returned to profits in the fourth quarter of 2006. Global crude oil prices plunged to a 19-month low of $51 a barrel in January before rebounding to around $65 a barrel at the end of March. Sinopec, which vies with PetroChina Co. Ltd. and CNOOC Ltd. to supply the world's second largest oil market, said its net profit was 19.4 billion yuan ($2.5 billion) in the first three months versus a revised 9.55 billion yuan a year earlier. The result beat a forecast for 18 billion yuan, according to three analysts polled by Reuters. A top economic planning official said last month China would adopt a cautious approach in reforming energy prices, to better suit international levels. Sinopec, also China's second-largest oil and gas producer, pumped 2.3 percent more crude and 15.6 percent more natural gas in 2006. It processed 146.32 million tonnes of crude last year, up 4.6 percent from a year earlier. Shares in Sinopec fell 8 percent in the January to March period, outperforming PetroChina's 16 percent fall but lagging CNOOC's 7 percent drop. Sinopec trades at 9.5 times forecast earnings, cheaper than Exxon Mobil's 12.2 and BP's 11. The index of Hong Kong-listed Chinese firms fell 7 percent in the first quarter. ($1=7.721 Yuan)
