 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Nasdaq Stock Market Inc. ( NDAQ.O ) said it will take a first-quarter charge of $24.9 million, or 10 cents a share, for expenses from its failed bid for the London Stock Exchange ( LSE.L ). 

 Nasdaq said it had previously disclosed the costs from its lapsed 2.7 billion pound ($5.36 billion) bid for the LSE but had not said they would expense them in the first quarter. The company expects a quarterly profit of $18.3 million, or 14 cents a share, when it reports results this Thursday, compared with net income of $18 million, or 16 cents per diluted share a year earlier. The electronic equity securities market said in a statement that it expected operating income of $81.4 million. Analysts on average expect Nasdaq to report earnings of 25 cents a share before items, according to Reuters Estimates. Nasdaq shares were down 0.9 percent in pre-market electronic trading. LSE shareholders in February overwhelmingly rejected the Nasdaq hostile takeover bid.
