 LONDON  (Reuters) - U.S. stock futures pointed to a higher opening on Wall Street on Monday, as sentiment was upbeat after a positive start to the U.S. earnings season and ahead of Citigroup's ( C.N ) results and retail sales data. 

 Eaton ( ETN.N ), Grainger ( GWW.N ), Mattel MAT.N, Wachovia WB.L and Eli Lilly ( LLY.N ) are among other companies due to report this session. U.S. stock index futures SPM7 DJM7 NDM7 were 0.2 to 0.3 percent higher, drawing support from an upbeat session on Friday when stronger profit outlooks from drug maker Merck & Co. ( MRK.N ) and fast-food restaurant chain McDonald's Corp. ( MCD.N ) boosted sentiment. "Citigroup is probably one of the bigger ones reporting today. Basically financial stocks will be in focus given that we had a fairly interesting Q1," said one analyst. "I think all eyes will be on the extent to which financial institutions weathered the storm of the downturn at the end of February, early March and the extent to which that impacts on corporate bottom lines will very much be at the heart of what's going on." At the end of February, worries about U.S. growth, a weakening mortgage market and a slide in Chinese stocks triggered a global equity sell-off which sent jitters across financial assets. Markets have since then regained much of their poise with the S&P 500 having fully recovered its losses but the Dow and Nasdaq have yet to complete their rebound. General Electric ( GE.N ), often considered a bellwether for the economy, also underpinned the market last week after posting higher quarterly profit and reaffirming its outlook. But investors kept cautious prior to U.S. retail sales at 1230 GMT, after a preliminary reading for data for April showed consumer sentiment fell to its lowest level in eight months while consumers' expectations for inflation shot higher. The U.S. economy has largely braved a creaking U.S. housing sector because of the resilience of U.S. consumers. Signs their confidence could we waning may spell trouble for the world's largest economy.
