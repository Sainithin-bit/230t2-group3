 MILAN  (Reuters) - U.S. phone giant AT&T ( T.N ) has pulled out of talks to buy a stake in Olimpia, which controls Italy's largest telecoms company Telecom Italia ( TLIT.MI ), Sky Italia television and the Wall Street Journal reported. 

 AT&T and Mexico's America Movil ( AMXL.MX ) had entered exclusive talks with Pirelli ( PECI.MI ) to buy a majority stake in Olimpia, which holds 18 percent of Telecom Italia, on April 1 and the exclusivity was to have ended on April 30. AT&T declined to comment while America Movil said it was unaware of reports that the U.S. company had pulled out. No one was immediately available to comment at Pirelli. The talks, which could have given control of the 44 billion euro telecoms company to the bidders for about 4.5 billion euros, had sparked a nationalist debate and Prime Minister Romano Prodi had said at the weekend that the government would be happy if Italian investors could step in. Italy's biggest retail bank, Intesa Sanpaolo ( ISP.MI ), had been in talks with AT&T and America Movil about splitting Olimpia into three but these had bogged down over governance issues, sources close to the situation told Reuters last week. Powerful investment bank Mediobanca ( MDBI.MI ) was also working on a solution which would keep control of Telecom Italia in domestic hands, possibly in conjunction with a European partner, media had reported. Intesa Sanpaolo CEO Corrado Passera said on Saturday his bank was considering various possibilities around Telecom Italia and on Monday he said the bank could take an equity stake.
