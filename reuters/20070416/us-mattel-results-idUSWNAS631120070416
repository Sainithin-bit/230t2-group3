 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Mattel Inc. MAT.N posted better-than-expected first-quarter results on Monday as sales of Hot Wheels and Fisher Price toys rose and overseas demand for the Barbie line increased. 

 Net income at the largest U.S. toy maker fell to $12 million, or 3 cents a share, from $30.2 million, or 8 cents a share, a year earlier. The year-earlier quarter's results were boosted by a $57 million tax benefit. Analysts on average were expecting a loss of 5 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Sales increased to $940.3 million from $793.3 million, topping the analysts' average estimate of $847.8 million. Worldwide gross sales of Barbie rose 2 percent, offsetting a decline in the United States, Mattel said. Later this month, Mattel is slated to unveil Barbie Girl, its next-generation fashion doll line, in its latest attempt to beat back a stiff challenge from MGA Entertainment's pouty-lipped, street-smart Bratz dolls. "Our channel checks suggest that Barbie is faring somewhat better this spring, but Bratz dolls continue to sell well," Sterne, Agee & Leach analyst Margaret Whitfield said in a research note. Whitfield, who has a "hold" rating on Mattel stock, said the Barbie Girl line has the potential to boost sales the same way the T.M.X Elmo did last year. Last year, Mattel filed a lawsuit claiming it owned Bratz because a former employee conceived the big-headed doll while working as a Barbie designer. Since coming to market in 1959, Barbie has been a key driver of Mattel's profits, and reinvigorating the brand has been one of the El Segundo, California-based company's top priorities in the last year. Gross sales of Mattel's girls and boys brands rose 15 percent to $567 million. Mattel also said Fisher Price sales rose 27 percent to $391.3 million, while sales of its Wheels category, which include Hot Wheels and Matchbox, rose 15 percent. Operating income for the quarter rose to $20.6 million, compared with a year-earlier loss of $32 million, the company said.
