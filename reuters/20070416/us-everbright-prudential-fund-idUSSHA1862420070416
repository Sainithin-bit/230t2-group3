 SHANGHAI  (Reuters) - Everbright Bank is poised to buy a 35 percent stake in the fund venture of U.S. insurer Prudential Financial ( PRU.N ) as the Chinese lender seeks to diversify into the country's booming asset management sector. 

 Two sources close to the situation told Reuters on Monday that Everbright Bank, which is 21 percent owned by Hong Kong-listed China Everbright Ltd. ( 0165.HK ), would buy the stake from China Everbright Group, which now holds a 67 percent stake of Shanghai-based Everbright Pramerica Fund Management Co. Beijing-based Everbright Group is the parent of financial services conglomerate China Everbright Ltd. Prudential Financial now has a 33 percent stake in Everbright Pramerica, which currently manages four mutual funds worth about 2.2 billion yuan ($284.9 million) in total, making it one of the country's smallest fund firms by assets. After the deal, Everbright Bank is expected to become the top shareholder of the fund venture, while Prudential will maintain a 33 percent stake. Everbright Group's stake will be reduced to 32 percent, which is likely to be sold to Prudential Financial and Everbright Bank eventually, the sources said. "It's actually a two-step plan ... In the first step, Everbright Bank will become the single largest shareholder of the joint venture and it will eventually increase its stake to 51 percent to strengthen its control," said one fund source. Everbright Bank, which is ready to receive a 20 billion yuan government capital injection ahead of a proposed overseas stock listing, declined to comment. Officials at Prudential and its fund venture were not immediately available for comment. Beijing, eager to shore up its banking sector, is encouraging banks to team up with foreign strategic partners and to go public at home or abroad. As part of the country's financial reform, Beijing granted approvals last year to three state lenders, Industrial & Commercial Bank of China ( 601398.SS )( 1398.HK ), Bank of Communications ( 3328.HK ) and China Construction Bank ( 0939.HK ), to set up the country's first bank-controlled fund ventures. Many of the country's more than 50 mutual fund management companies are enjoying hefty profits as millions of Chinese investors pile into the bullish A-share market through mutual funds, whose assets under management have grown to around 1 trillion yuan from virtually nothing just a few years ago. "If Everbright Bank can make the deal ahead of its listing, it will be good for catching the eye of potential IPO investors," said another source close to the bank. "Every bank has to make clear to its investors what the business advantage is. For instance, Merchants Bank ( 600036.SS )( 3698.HK ) can say it is a market leader for credit cards and it seems Everbright Bank wants to become a leader for wealth management business," he added. In addition to Everbright Bank, Shanghai Pudong Development Bank ( 600000.SS ), Minsheng Banking Corp. ( 600016.SS ) and Agricultural Bank of China ABC.UL are all awaiting regulatory approval for their own fund ventures, industry sources have said. Everbright Bank Vice President Li Ziqing told Reuters in an interview last month that the bank planned to derive at least 10 percent of 2007 total profits from fee income-based businesses, up from about 8 percent of the bank's profits in 2006. Li also noted that cooperation with fund managers on wealth management areas would be a key avenue for the bank to boost its fee income-based service. Everbright Bank is finalizing details of the purchase with Everbright Group, and the deal would require approval from Chinese banking and securities regulators, sources said. ($1=7.73 Yuan)
