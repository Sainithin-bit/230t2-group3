 MELBOURNE  (Reuters) - Australian retailer Coles Group Ltd., subject of a potential bidding war, is likely to further lose market share to rivals and a new owner will have a tough time reversing the trend. 

 Conglomerate Wesfarmers Ltd. has launched a A$19.7 billion ($16.4 billion) offer for Australia's second-largest retailer, but faces competition from a Kohlberg Kravis Roberts-led consortium of private equity firms. Coles has attracted strong bidding interest, partly on the prospects for turning around its core food and liquor business and improving margins to catch up with larger rival Woolworths Ltd "The opportunity for a new owner of Coles to change the situation in a short time is limited," said Citigroup analysts Craig Woolford and Andy Bowley in a research note. They said the troubles at Coles have been a "bonanza" for its competitors because price-sensitive shoppers to Bi-Lo stores have switched to competitors and the converted stores are too small to be viable as Coles stores. "We expect both Woolworths and Metcash to take significant market share from Coles over the next six months," the analysts said. Metcash Ltd. operates a wholesale distribution business to most of the independent supermarkets. Citigroup said Coles was set to lose more than A$900 million in sales over the next two years to competitors as a result. It estimated Woolworths would gain 1 percentage point of market share in food and liquor, while Metcash would gain 3 percentage points. Woolworths has about 40 percent of the grocery market compared with Coles' 35 percent. The failed conversion of budget Bi-Lo stores and a shortfall in profits led Coles to put itself up for auction in February. Since that announcement, Coles shares have jumped 20 percent despite reporting flat sales, while Woolworths has risen 14 percent and Metcash is up 10 percent. PLAYING CATCH-UP In addition to the core food and liquor business, Coles also owns discount clothing chain Target and business supplies chain Officeworks, which are well-run and are likely to attract other bidders. "I don't think a turnaround in the supermarket business would be easy by any stretch of the imagination," said an analyst at another major brokerage, who asked not to be identified. The analyst pointed to the advantages held by Woolworths, which is in the final stages of a major overhaul of its supply chain that has taken years and substantially cut costs. Coles has been playing catch-up since Woolworths began the overhaul. Investors may get a clearer picture of the benefits at Woolworths when the retailer releases its third-quarter sales results on Tuesday. It has been increasing market share for the past year. Retail industry observers say much depends on the management that Wesfarmers, KKR or any other new owner puts in place. "An experienced retailer can just walk around the store and immediately know what needs to be done," said Shaw Stockbroking analyst Scott Marshall. "The issue is how to manage the restructuring properly." He noted KKR has gone through a similar process several times overseas, while Wesfarmers could tap the experience of former Coles senior manager Steven Cain, who is now a director of Pacific Equity Parners, which is part of the Wesfarmers bid. Wesfarmers has already built up a 12.8 percent voting stake in Coles and proposes to jointly own the core business with private equity firms PEP and Permira. The KKR consortium, which includes Bain, CVC, Blackstone Group, Carlyle Group and TPG, has not made a firm bid but said it expects to match or top the Wesfarmers offer. ($1=A$1.20)
