 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Black & Decker Corp. BDK.N raised its first-quarter profit and sales forecasts on Monday, citing strong international demand for power tools and favorable U.S. order trends, and its shares rose nearly 7 percent in extended trading. 

 Shares of the maker of Dewalt drills, Kwikset locks and Price Pfister faucets rose to $89.50 in after-hours trade after closing at $83.72 on Monday on the New York Stock Exchange. However, the company's chief executive, Nolan Archibald, warned in a written statement that the economic environment remains challenging. He said that Black & Decker would only increase its full-year earnings forecast slightly when it reports quarterly results later this month. Black & Decker said it expects to report first-quarter net earnings of $1.60 per share, up from a previous view of $1.25 per share to $1.30 per share. Wall Street analysts, on average, had been expecting earnings of $1.26 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. The company also said it expects sales to rise 3 percent, helped by favorable currency translation and the 2006 acquisition of Vector Products Inc., which makes vehicle battery chargers. Black & Decker, based in Towson, Maryland, cut its earnings forecast multiple times last year as weakening home construction and sales hurt demand for its products. In January, Black & Decker had said it expected sales and earnings to decline in the first half of 2007. But it also said orders had stabilized and large customers had begun a modest restocking of its products. (Additional reporting by  Karen Jacobs )
