 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Eli Lilly and Co. ( LLY.N ) reported better-than-expected first-quarter profit on Monday amid surging demand for depression treatment Cymbalta and higher sales of other drugs, sending its shares up 2 percent. 

 The drugmaker also raised its 2007 sales and profit forecasts slightly due to "stronger underlying business fundamentals." Lilly now expects earnings this year to rise as much as 7 percent from 2006. Even so, this would be down from the 11 percent growth seen last year. Excluding special items, Lilly posted a first-quarter profit of 84 cents a share, 5 cents better than analysts' average forecast as compiled by Reuters Estimates. Results benefited from an average 5 percent rise in drug prices and were boosted another 2 percent by foreign exchange factors, Lilly said. Sales jumped 14 percent to $4.23 billion, topping analysts' average forecast of $4.11 billion. Cancer treatments Gemzar and Alimta, schizophrenia drug Zyprexa and impotence treatment Cialis all showed sales gains. "Growth for most of Lilly's key products is moderating, and hence, the company is dependent on stable Zyprexa revenues and Cymbalta and Cialis growth trends," Deutsche Bank analyst Barbara Ryan said in a research note. Special items in the quarter included a charge of $304 million related to the purchase of biotechnology company ICOS, and charges of $123 million for restructuring and other expenses. Including these and other special items, net earnings fell to $509 million, or 47 cents per share, from $835 million, or 77 cents per share, a year earlier. Zyprexa revenue rose 10 percent to $1.11 billion. Demand for the drug waned in the United States amid concerns about its tendency to cause weight gains, although sales in this important market grew 6 percent thanks to price increases. Lilly officials told analysts in a conference call that Zyprexa's impressive overseas sales growth was due largely to cutbacks in purchases by wholesalers in Japan in the year-earlier period. They said 2007 global sales of the drug will likely be "flat." Sales of the anti-depressant Cymbalta leaped 89 percent to $441.8 million despite the recent availability of far-cheaper generic forms of a Cymbalta rival, Zoloft, which is made by Pfizer Inc. ( PFE.N ). Cymbalta was also helped by its new use against generalized anxiety disorder, approved by U.S. regulators in February. Lilly took full control of Cialis by buying ICOS, with which it had sold the impotence pill. Global first-quarter sales of the drug, which works far longer than Pfizer's Viagra, rose 19 percent to $266 million. But sales of Strattera, for attention deficit disorder, slipped 8 percent to $140 million on growing concerns that such drugs can pose heart risks and cause psychiatric problems, including hallucinations. Lilly now expects earnings this year of $3.30 to $3.40 per share, up from $3.18 in 2006. It said sales should grow in the "low-double digits," compared with its previous forecast for growth in the high single digits to low double digits. Lilly shares were up $1.12 to $58.00 in morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange.
