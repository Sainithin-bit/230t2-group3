 MEXICO CITY  (Reuters) - Mexico's America Movil ( AMX.N ) and Telmex TMX.N said on Monday they were weighing their options after partner AT&T ( T.N ) pulled out of talks to buy a stake in Olimpia, which controls Italy's Telecom Italia 

  ( TLIT.MI ). Arturo Elias, a spokesman for the Mexican telecoms companies, said they could seek other partners, go it alone or pull out of the talks with Pirelli ( PECI.MI ) to buy a majority stake in Olimpia. "That is exactly what we are going to analyze," he told Reuters. America Movil and Telmex, both owned by billionaire tycoon Carlos Slim, and AT&T had entered into exclusive talks with Pirelli, which holds 18 percent of Telecom Italia, in a bid to buy control of Telecom Italia for about 4.5 billion euros. The talks have sparked a nationalist debate in Italy. Prime Minister Romano Prodi said over the weekend the government would be happy if Italian investors stepped in. Prodi's public dispute with Telecom Italia last year over strategy led to the resignation of its chairman, Marco Tronchetti Provera, who still heads Pirelli and ultimately controls the telecoms company through Olimpia. Analysts said the withdrawal of AT&T put the bid in doubt as it meant America Movil and Telmex would have to pay out twice the amount of money originally planned if no other partner emerges. Manuel Jimenez, analyst with Vector brokerage in Mexico City, said there was also the question of winning the blessing of the Italian government and its desire to see local investors involved in any takeover of Telecom Italia. "This (AT&T's withdrawal) has changed the panorama," Jimenez said. "We do not know how this is going to end." Shares in America Movil ( AMXL.MX ) slipped on the Mexican bourse, to close down 0.50 percent at 27.83 pesos. Its New York-traded stock fell 0.35 percent to close at $50.72. Telmex's shares TELMEXL.MX rose 0.62 percent to 19.59 pesos and its American Depositary Receipts gained 0.76 percent to $35.67. (Additional reporting by Tomas Sarmiento)
