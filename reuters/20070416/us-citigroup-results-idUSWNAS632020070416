 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Citigroup Inc. ( C.N ) said on Monday that first-quarter profit fell 11 percent, hurt by a restructuring charge, yet results topped forecasts on a surge in trading gains. 

 Though profit declined for a third straight quarter, Citigroup shares rose more than 3 percent amid signs that Chief Executive Charles Prince's efforts to rein in costs are bearing fruit. The shares were the biggest gainer in the Dow Jones Industrial Average  .DJI . "These were excellent results, much better than expected," said Steve Roukis, managing director at Matrix Asset Advisors Inc. in New York. "Chuck Prince would have had a limited time as CEO if negative operating leverage continued. You're seeing the results of his being accountable to shareholders." Net income fell to $5.01 billion, or $1.01 per share, from $5.64 billion, or $1.12, a year earlier. Excluding an $871 million restructuring charge, profit totaled $1.18 per share. That beat the average analyst forecast of $1.10, according to Reuters Estimates. Citigroup shares rose $1.81, or 3.5 percent, to $53.41 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange. JPMorgan Chase & Co. ( JPM.N ), a Dow component that reports results on Wednesday, rose 2 percent. Results benefited from a 37 percent increase in fixed income capital markets revenue from the fourth quarter, and a 65 percent increase in equity revenue. "It was an amazing quarter in capital markets," said Adam Compton, head of U.S. financials research at RCM Global Investors. "You have to come away feeling better about Citi. They showed good execution." Revenue rose 15 percent to $25.46 billion, while operating expenses rose 17 percent to $15.57 billion. Excluding the charge, which was $1.38 billion before taxes, expenses rose just 6 percent. Citigroup on April 11 said it will eliminate 17,000 jobs, or 5 percent of its workforce, and move another 3 percent to lower-cost locations, to help cut spending by $4.58 billion. Prince is under pressure from many shareholders to cut costs, and boost profit and revenue enough to re-energize a long-lagging share price. Prince intends much of Citigroup's growth to be outside the United States. TRADING PROFIT SURGES Assets shot past $2 trillion for the first time, ending the quarter at $2.02 trillion. Contributing to this gain was a 40 percent surge in trading account assets, to $460.1 billion. Year-over-year revenue increased 20 percent from fixed-income capital markets and 26 percent from equity markets. The consumer unit, Citigroup's largest business, continued to struggle, as net interest margin, excluding a one-time item related to Japan, narrowed 0.14 percentage points from the fourth quarter. Profit fell 14 percent to $2.63 billion, as revenue rose 10 percent to $13.11 billion. At the U.S. unit, profit fell 12 percent and revenue rose 6 percent, while international consumer profit fell 16 percent and revenue rose 14 percent. Wealth management profit, including the Smith Barney brokerage and private bank, rose 56 percent to $448 million. Profit from alternative investments fell 37 percent to $222 million. Through Friday, Citigroup shares had fallen 7 percent this year, compared with a 4 percent decline in the 24-member Philadelphia KBW Bank Index .BKX. The shares were up 13 percent since Prince took over in October 2003, less than half the gains at Bank of America Corp. ( BAC.N ) and JPMorgan, its largest rivals.
