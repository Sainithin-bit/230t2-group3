 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Yahoo Inc. said on Monday it has expanded an online advertising partnership with U.S. newspapers to include McClatchy Co., while two large publishers said they would not join the group. 

 Newspapers hope the partnership, which consists of more than 264 newspapers, will bring them more Internet advertising revenue because it reaches a wider audience through a network of newspaper sites that includes Belo Corp., EW Scripps Co., and Lee Enterprises. The consortium does not include Tribune Co. and Gannett Co. Inc., which publish some of the largest newspapers in the country, including the Los Angeles Times and USA Today. The companies told Reuters they are working on their own advertising network. Yahoo said it wants a stronger foothold in the local Web ad market and closer ties with the newspaper industry. It is facing fierce competition from Web search leader Google Inc. Yahoo and the newspapers will share ad revenue. Executives on a conference call with reporters and analysts on Monday declined to say what percentage each would get. Newspapers are anxious to capitalize on Internet opportunities as their paid print circulation declines and advertising sales slow because of competition from other media, primarily television and the Internet. "We had 12 companies, more or less pursuing the same kinds of objectives, each with its own strategy and each with its own technology," Belo Chief Executive Robert Decherd told Reuters. The decision to work with Yahoo shows that newspapers have determined that it is better to find a partner with technology expertise and a large amount of visitors, said Ken Doctor, a media industry analyst for Outsell Inc. "They've tried to build their own audiences and they have to some degree, but Yahoo's audience clearly dwarfs what newspapers have done," he said. The Yahoo partnership, which was formed in November, consists of newspapers in 44 states, including the Miami Herald and Hearst Corp.'s San Francisco Chronicle. "I believe there's momentum behind this consortium," McClatchy CEO Gary Pruitt told Reuters. "I hope and expect that there will be additional companies joining the group." Over the next 18 months, the group's newspaper sites will incorporate Yahoo's technology for graphical advertising. Financial terms were not disclosed. The expanded agreement also integrates Yahoo's paid search technology on the Web sites, which together cite more than 50 million users on a monthly basis. Yahoo's network of Web sites will be able to tap the newspaper consortium for local news, sports, finance and other information to place online. "We are in general positive on the newspaper-Yahoo! online national advertising network," Merrill Lynch analyst Karl Choi wrote in a note to clients, on Monday, "but the devil is in the details, as we foresee substantial execution issues." TRIBUNE, GANNETT STICK TOGETHER Tribune and Gannett, two of the largest U.S. newspaper publishers, said on Monday they would continue working together on an advertising network of their own. McClatchy had been discussing an ad partnership with the two companies, but no formal agreement had been reached. Gannett, McClatchy and Tribune own stakes in online jobs site Careerbuilder.com and local search forum Topix.com. McClatchy will stay in those agreements, Pruitt said. Gannett's and Tribune's Web sites had about 37 million unique monthly visitors in March, a Gannett spokeswoman said. "Gannett continues to talk with multiple parties about an ad network and how it should be constituted, focusing on issues of governance, content and exclusivity," said Tara Connell. Yahoo shares rose 20 cents to close at $31.61, McClatchy fell 27 cents to $31.19. Gannett shares rose 38 cents to $58.03 and Tribune climbed 4 cents to $32.83.
