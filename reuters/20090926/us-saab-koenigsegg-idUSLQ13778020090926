 STOCKHOLM  (Reuters) - Koenigsegg's top executive said on Saturday the luxury sport scar maker still aimed to finalize a deal to buy Saab Automobile from General Motors by the end of October. 

 Koenigsegg Chief Executive and part owner Christian von Koenigsegg also told Reuters that good progress was being made in talks to secure Swedish state guarantees for billions of crowns of loans from the European Investment Bank (EIB). "Our deadline for the deal still remains the end of October as we have previously said," he said. (Reporting by  Niklas Pollard )
