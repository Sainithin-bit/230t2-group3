 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Chrysler LLC's finance arm has told dealers it may temporarily stop loans used by dealers to stock vehicles because the retailers pulled money from a fund that helps finance them. 

 Chrysler Financial Chief Executive Tom Gilman sent letters to dealers, dated December 12, that asked them to refrain from withdrawing large amounts from a "cash management account" used to finance the loans, a source familiar with the letter said. Withdrawals from the fund, which have totaled more than $1.5 billion since July, have caused a drain on Chrysler's resources and could limit the company's ability to offer financing to dealers to buy vehicles, according to the letter. Chrysler Financial said in a statement that it finances 75 percent of all vehicles shipped to U.S. dealers and continues to support its dealer network with "uninterrupted" wholesale financing. The letter said about $60 million a day is being withdrawn from the account, which is "well above our historical daily advances." Chrysler dealers were paid a bonus if they kept money in the account. Talk about potential bankruptcy at Chrysler, which is seeking federal loans to survive through March, has spooked dealers, who withdrew heavily from the account in the past few months. Chrysler has asked dealers to only withdraw "what is absolutely necessary" from the fund, according to the letter. Chrysler, which has seen sales fall 28 percent so far this year, is also facing pressure from some suppliers who were insisting on being paid in advance for goods. Chrysler LLC and larger rival General Motors Corp have said they need billions of dollars in immediate bridge loans to avert a near-term collapse. A government bailout for automakers was being assembled as quickly and carefully as possible, Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said on Tuesday, as a new ratings report showed bankruptcy was the most likely restructuring scenario for the industry. The National Automobile Dealers Association urged the government to act soon on the emergency loans to automakers, saying that with each passing day, more dealerships are closing and more people are losing their jobs. "These are desperate times in many communities around the country," NADA Chairwoman Annette Sykora said in a statement.
