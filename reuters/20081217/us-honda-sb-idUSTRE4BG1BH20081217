 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Honda Motor Co ( 7267.T ) cut its annual profit forecast by 67 percent on Wednesday, marking its third profit warning this year, as a deepening financial crisis hammers global car demand and sends the yen soaring. 

 Until as recently as two months ago, Japan's No.2 automaker had been expected to weather the industry downturn better than its rivals thanks to its fuel-efficient fleet, but demand for cars has shrunk indiscriminately since the Lehman Shock of September, piling up inventories despite massive production cuts. Honda's profit warning could touch off similar moves at domestic rivals such as Toyota Motor Corp ( 7203.T ) and Nissan Motor Co ( 7201.T ), which are also reeling from the dollar's fall to 13-year lows against the yen. Shares of Honda ended the day down 4.2 percent as investors braced for the profit warning after the company abruptly moved up its year-end news conference scheduled for Friday with a day's warning. Honda, which is also suffering from softening motorcycle sales, now expects operating profit for the business year to March 31 at 180 billion yen ($2 billion), down 81 percent from last year and far worse than the 300 billion yen reported by the Nikkei business daily. It had previously forecast 550 billion yen. A poll of 18 brokerages surveyed by Reuters Estimates puts Honda's 2008/09 operating profit at 486 billion yen, although most estimates have not been updated in the last month. Honda cut its net profit forecast to 185 billion yen from 485 billion yen and revenue projection to 10.4 trillion yen from 11.6 trillion yen. Automakers everywhere are reeling from a sharp downturn in sales due to a global recession and tight credit, and they are under pressure to put off big investments and expansion plans to weather the storm. Japanese carmakers are being punished especially hard by a robust yen, which is approaching 88 yen to the dollar after the U.S. Federal Reserve took the historic move of cutting its federal funds rate target to a range of zero to 0.25 percent, a record low. Honda cut its assumed dollar rate to 95 yen from 100 yen for the October-March second half. It estimates that every 1-yen swing in the dollar affects annual operating profit by about 20 billion yen ($220 million). Honda, like every other carmaker in the world, has been announcing production and workforce reductions, so far scaling back output plans by about 200,000 units for this business year. In an effort to clamp down on non-essential spending, Honda earlier this month pulled out of Formula One racing, saying it needed the resources to weather the economic downturn and to develop next-generation vehicles.
