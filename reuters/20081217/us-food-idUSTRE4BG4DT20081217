 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Rival food makers General Mills Inc ( GIS.N ) and ConAgra Foods Inc ( CAG.N ) posted higher-than-expected quarterly profits on Wednesday, helped by price increases and expense controls. 

 Shares of General Mills, which also raised its full-year forecast, fell 1 percent in early trading, while ConAgra gained 5.5 percent. General Mills, the maker of Progresso Soup and Cheerios cereal, has benefited along with other food companies as consumers buy more cake mixes, yogurt and other groceries to save money by eating at home more often. ConAgra posted higher-than-expected quarterly profit on strong results at its commercial foods business, which sells specialty potatoes, seasonings and other items. But while General Mills was able to raise prices and sell more retail food in the United States, ConAgra saw sales volume fall at its consumer goods business, hurt by weakness at its Banquet frozen dinner and Wesson cooking oil brands. General Mills' profit fell to $378.2 million, or $1.09 a share, in the second quarter ended November 23, from $390.5 million, or $1.14 share, a year earlier. Excluding a charge to write down the market value of some commodity hedges and a gain from selling the Pop Secret popcorn business, earnings were $1.36 a share. Analysts on average had forecast $1.23, according to Reuters Estimates. Sales rose 8 percent to $4.01 billion, in line with analysts' estimates. Individual segments saw better U.S. sales as recession-hit consumers spent less time at restaurants and prepared their own meals. For example, sales of baking products rose 16 percent, boosted by Betty Crocker dessert mixes. General Mills' U.S. retail sales as a whole rose 10 percent, with half of the increase stemming from increased volume. The company said it also had benefited from demand for Totino's frozen pizzas and Yoplait yogurt. General Mills said it still expected a 9 percent increase in commodity costs for the year and that a stronger dollar would cut into sales and earnings. Higher costs for grains, oil and other commodities have hit food companies for the past two years, although some prices have started to retreat from historic high levels reached earlier in the year. General Mills raised its fiscal-year earnings forecast to a range of $3.83 to $3.87 a share, excluding special items, from a previous outlook of $3.81 to $3.85. ConAgra posted strong results at its commercial business for its second quarter, which also ended on November 23, but profit fell 8 percent on a comparable basis at the larger consumer segment because of higher-than-expected commodity costs and a 4 percent drop in volume. The maker of Chef Boyardee canned pasta and Orville Redenbacher popcorn said overall earnings fell to $168.1 million, or 37 cents a share, from $244.8 million, or 50 cents a share, a year earlier, when it operated a commodity trading business that it has since sold. Excluding one-time items, earnings were 43 cents a share, compared with the analysts' average estimate of 38 cents. Sales rose 10.6 percent to $3.26 billion. ConAgra stood by its full-year forecast for earnings slightly above $1.50 a share, excluding one-time items. It said it expected improvement in the consumer foods business, especially in the fourth quarter. (Reporting by Brad Dorfman; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn)
