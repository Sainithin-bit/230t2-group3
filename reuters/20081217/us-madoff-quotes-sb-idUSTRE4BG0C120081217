 (Reuters) - Bernard Madoff, the longtime Wall Street executive, is accused of cheating investors worldwide out of $50 billion. 

 Here are some of Madoff's public comments over the years: - On his trading approach: "It's a proprietary strategy. I can't go into it in great detail." - Barron's, May 7, 2001 - Speaking on a panel called "The Future of the Stock Market" at the Philoctetes Center for the Multidisciplinary Study of the Imagination in New York on Oct 20, 2007, Madoff said: - On regulations: "In today's regulatory environment, it's virtually impossible to violate rules ... but it's impossible for a violation to go undetected, certainly not for a considerable period of time." - On the dynamics between investors and Wall Street firms: "The nature of any human being, certainly anyone on Wall Street, is 'the better deal you give the customer, the worse deal it is for you.'" - On the subject of large swings in the market: "Take my word for it, for the most part you can ignore those moves." - On the costs of regulatory compliance: "No one is going to run a benefit for Wall Street." Here are some other quotes from Madoff, cited in various publications: - On electronic trading: "All we're doing is passing our savings on to our client base." - Fortune Magazine, Nov 19, 1990. - On a canceled crab race at the Securities Industry Association Convention in Boca Raton, Fla.: "There's enough happening in the securities industry without taking on animal rights." - Wall Street Journal, Dec 2, 1994. - On day-trading: "If the bull peters out, day-trading will die of its own weight." - Forbes, April 6, 1998. - On the dangers of the Internet bubble: "I don't like to see this type of activity. Eventually, if this bubble bursts, I think that people will be left holding the bag. I don't want to be around when that happens." - Wall Street Journal, Jan 14, 1999. - On what fed the Internet bubble: "You had a lot of novice investors who got into the market looking for easy money, without any regard to the fundamentals. These stocks were running on fumes." - Washington Post, Jan 2, 2001. (Compiled by Phil Wahba; Editing by  Bernard Orr )
