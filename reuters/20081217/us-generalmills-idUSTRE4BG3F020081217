 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - General Mills Inc ( GIS.N ) posted a higher-than-expected quarterly profit and raised its full-year forecast on Wednesday, helped by cost cuts and investments in marketing and new products. 

 The maker of Progresso Soup and Cheerios cereal has benefited along with other food companies as consumers buy more soup, cake mixes and yogurt to save money by eating at home more often. Shares in the company rose nearly 3 percent before the market opened. But General Mills also said that a stronger dollar would cut into sales and earnings for the year. The company posted profit of $378.2 million, or $1.09 a share, for the second quarter ended November 23, compared with $390.5 million, or $1.14 share, a year earlier. Excluding a charge to write down the market value of some commodity hedges and a gain from selling the Pop Secret popcorn business, earnings were $1.36 a share. Analysts on average had forecast $1.23, according to Reuters Estimates. Sales rose 8 percent to $4.01 billion, in line with analysts' estimates. Individual segments saw better U.S. sales as recession-hit consumers spend less time at restaurants and prepare their own meals. For example, sales of baking products rose 16 percent, boosted by Betty Crocker dessert mixes. U.S. retail sales as a whole rose 10 percent, also benefiting from demand for Totino's frozen pizzas and Yoplait yogurt. General Mills said it still expected a 9 percent increase in commodity costs for the year. Higher costs for grains, oil and other commodities have hit food companies for the past two years, although some prices have started to retreat from historic high levels reached earlier in the year. General Mills raised its fiscal-year earnings forecast to a range of $3.83 to $3.87 a share, excluding special items, from a previous outlook of $3.81 to $3.85. The company's shares rose to $63 in light premarket trading from a close of $61.25 on Tuesday. (Reporting by  Brad Dorfman ; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn)
