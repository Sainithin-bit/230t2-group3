 (Reuters) - Confidence in the future has been shaken by a recession-mired economy and growing job insecurity, but Americans are upbeat about President-elect Barack Obama's performance, a Reuters/Zogby poll released on Wednesday found. 

 Here are some of the results of the poll, which had a margin of error of 3.1 percentage points. * President George W. Bush earned positive job marks from 24 percent, slightly higher than the record Zogby-poll low of 21 percent in October. * The early performance of President-elect Barack Obama won positive reviews from 65 percent of respondents. * Congress won approval from 10 percent, up from its paltry 8 percent support in November. * The number of Americans who believe the country is on the right track dropped from 30 percent last month to 28 percent. * Those who felt "very" or "fairly" secure in their jobs fell to just more than 59 percent from nearly 64 percent. The number of people who were not very or not at all secure in their jobs doubled from 7 percent to 14 percent. * About 71 percent said they expected the economy will be doing better in a year. * About 78 percent of Americans said they would be cutting back on spending for presents and entertainment during this holiday season because of the recession. * The number of people who gave their personal finances positive marks fell from 48 percent to 47 percent. * About 54 percent of Americans oppose a bailout for the auto industry, compared to 41 percent who back one. * About 71 percent believed Obama would be at least somewhat effective in his efforts to reform the U.S. health care system.
