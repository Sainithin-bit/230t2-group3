 TOKYO  (Reuters) - The Nikkei average rose 1.1 percent on Wednesday, with banking stocks among the biggest gainers after the U.S. Federal Reserve slashed borrowing costs to a record low, prompting a rally on Wall Street. 

 But Honda Motor Co ( 7267.T ) tumbled more than 4 percent on expectations that it will likely issue its third profit warning of the year on Wednesday, after abruptly moving up its year-end news conference by two days. The news conference is now set for 3 p.m.    The benchmark Nikkei  .N225  added 91.14 points to 8,659.16, after rising over 2 percent earlier. It fell 1.1 percent the previous day. The broader Topix  .TOPX  gained 0.9 percent to 836.13. (Reporting by  Aiko Hayashi )
