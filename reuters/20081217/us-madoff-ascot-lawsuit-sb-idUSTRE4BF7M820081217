 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The New York Law School on Tuesday sued investment firm Ascot Partners LP, its general partner J. Ezra Merkin and auditor BDO Seidman LLP over investments with Bernard Madoff, the man accused last week of one of Wall Street's biggest frauds. 

 The putative class action lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan said the defendants "recklessly or with gross negligence caused and permitted $1.8 billion, virtually the entire investment capital of Ascot" to be handed over to Madoff, the suspected perpetrator of a $50 billion securities fraud. Merkin's lawyer Andrew Levander said in a statement that Merkin and his family were among the largest victims of the alleged fraud. "Like the other victims and the entire financial community, Mr Merkin is shocked by these events," the statement said. "He intends to defend this lawsuit vigorously, while seeking redress for himself and his investors from whoever perpetrated this fraud." New York Law School is a limited partner in Ascot, which is managed by Merkin, a general partner. Merkin is also chairman of GMAC LLC, the financing subsidiary of General Motors Corp. The lawsuit, which seeks class action status, also identifies Ascot's independent auditor BDO Seidman LLP as a defendant. The auditor said in a statement that while it is understandable investors are "frustrated and angry" it is "unfortunate that these investors would bring legal action before all of the facts are known and seek to blame others for their own investment decisions." BDO Seidman said its audits of Ascot Partners "conformed to all professional standards and we will vigorously defend ourselves against these unfounded allegations." A representative for Ascot could not immediately be reached for comment. "Plaintiff's investment in Ascot has been decimated as a direct result of defendant Merkin's abdication of his responsibilities and duties ... and complete failure of Ascot's auditor Seidman in light of 'red flags' indicating a high risk to Ascot from concentrating its investment exposure in Madoff," the lawsuit said. It also said Seidman issued audit reports of Ascot's annual financial statements, which New York Law School and other limited partners of Ascot relied on. The school has about 1,500 students. It said that, through its endowment, it invested $3 million in Ascot in 2006. Madoff, who is accused of defrauding banks, charities and rich individuals worldwide whose money he managed, was released on a $10 million bond by a federal magistrate judge in New York following his arrest on Thursday. He could find himself back in court on Wednesday if the conditions of his bail are not met. Madoff has been charged in a criminal complaint with one count of securities fraud. He faces up to 20 years in prison and a fine of up to $5 million if convicted. He was arrested after his two sons told authorities that Madoff had confessed to fraud. The government contends that, since 2005, Madoff had been running a Ponzi scheme, a scam in which early investors are paid off with money from later investors. The case is New York Law School, individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated, v Ascot Partners L.P., J. Ezra Merkin and BDO Seidman LLP, No 08-10922.
