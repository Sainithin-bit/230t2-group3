 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Pilgrim's Pride Corp PGPDQ.PK, which filed for bankruptcy protection earlier this month, said on Tuesday that its chief executive and chief operating officer have resigned as part of the bankruptcy process. 

 Clint Rivers, president and chief executive of the largest U.S. chicken company, and Robert Wright, its chief operating officer, are stepping down. The company said Don Jackson will take over as president and chief executive, subject to approval of the bankruptcy court. He was previously president of Foster Farms' poultry division. Until the court can approve his appointment, Board Chairman Lonnie Ken Pilgrim will serve as interim president, the company said. Pilgrim's Pride has struggled in the past year with high feed costs and low meat prices. It has said it intends to operate normally while it develops a reorganization plan. The case is In re Pilgrim's Pride Corp, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Northern District of Texas, No. 08-45664. (Reporting by  Emily Chasan ; Editing by  Gary Hill )
