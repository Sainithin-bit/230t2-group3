 MOSCOW  (Reuters) - Russia is not in talks over joining OPEC and has not pledged any oil output cuts in its memo to the oil producers' group this week, deputy energy minister Anatoliy Yanovsky said on Wednesday. 

 "There is no talk of Russia joining OPEC," Yanovsky told reporters, adding that Russia has given a memorandum of cooperation to the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. Asked if the document contained any output cut pledges on Russia's part, he said: "Of course not." (Reporting by Vladimir Soldatkin, writing by Toni Vorobyova)
