 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The White House said on Wednesday it was aware that U.S. automakers were taking action to cope with financial strains, after Chrysler announced it was shutting down all of its manufacturing operations for at least a month. 

 White House spokesman Tony Fratto declined to comment directly on Chrysler's plan but said, "Everyone's aware that the automakers are in a difficult financial condition and they are taking action to deal with it." "That's why we're having these discussions," he added, referring to the Bush administration's effort to determine how to aid ailing automakers. President George W. Bush said a decision was needed "relatively soon" on bailing out the industry. (Reporting by  Matt Spetalnick , Editing by Sandra Maler)
