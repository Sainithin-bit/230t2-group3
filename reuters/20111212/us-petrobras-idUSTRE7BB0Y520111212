 SAO PAULO  (Reuters) - Brazilian state-controlled oil company Petrobras will continue to raise funds in European capital markets despite the worsening of a sovereign debt crisis in that region, an official said on Monday. 
 The crisis in the Euro region is unlikely to hamper financing for the company's $225 billion, five-year investment plan, the largest in the oil industry, Jorge Nahas, Petrobras head of risk management and financial planning, said at an event in Sao Paulo.
