 MEXICO CITY  (Reuters) - Mexico's banking regulator is investigating a local Stanford bank unit for possible violation of banking laws, an official at the financial industry watchdog said on Thursday. 

 The CNBV regulator is looking into whether Mexican unit Stanford Fondos broke laws on investing abroad, Carlos Lopez-Moctezuma, a senior official, told Reuters. Mexican financial laws forbid Mexican banks to encourage clients to invest in unauthorized certificates of deposits abroad. (Reporting by  Pablo Garibian , Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)
