 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japan's Nikkei average rose 0.3 percent on Thursday, a day after closing at its lowest point in nearly four months, as blue-chip exporters gained on the dollar's first move above 93 yen in six weeks. 

 Fast Retailing Co climbed after a brokerage upgrade on expectations for robust sales at its Uniqlo discount clothing chain, while Astellas Pharma rose after another brokerage upgraded its stock and recommended it as a defensive play. But investors remained wary as the yen is under pressure due to concern about the Japanese economy and political uncertainty, with voter support sinking for Prime Minister Taro Aso. "The market seems to be depending only on buying based on what is undervalued and where it stands in terms of technical levels," said Tomomi Yamashita, a fund manager at Shinkin Asset Management. "A stronger dollar is positive for exporters, but that means the trend where money flows into the yen as the least unfavorable option is becoming less apparent. That is due to worries about political uncertainty and gross domestic product in Japan, putting domestic demand stocks under pressure." The Nikkei gained 23.21 points to 7,557.65, capping three days of losses in which it fell about 3 percent. On Wednesday, the benchmark booked its lowest close since October 27. The broader Topix also added 0.3 percent, rising to 751.59 after ending the previous day a whisker away from its lowest close in 25 years. After the market close, top Japanese tire maker Bridgestone Corp said its operating profit fell 47 percent in 2008 on weak U.S. sales, yen strength and high raw materials costs, and it forecast a further drop this year. The stock ended the day up 1.7 percent at 1,351 yen before the announcement. The market largely brushed aside news from the Bank of Japan, which said it would extend the deadline for its buying of commercial paper to support corporate funding. It kept interest rates at 0.10 percent in a unanimous vote. "Even though it will expand its measures, the BOJ is basically maintaining its current policies, and that helps support the market," said Yutaka Miura, senior technical analyst at Shinko Securities. WEAKER YEN HELPS EXPORTERS The dollar traded above 93 yen after President Barack Obama pledged up to $275 billion to stem U.S. home mortgage foreclosures, but the move was not enough to calm Wall Street fears about the housing market and economy. Exporters' shares gained as investors welcome a weaker yen, which boosts exporters' profits when repatriated. Toyota Motor Corp gained 2 percent to 3,120 yen and Honda Motor Co climbed 1.8 percent to 2,290 yen. Sony Corp rose 0.8 percent to 1,614 yen. Fast Retailing advanced 1.4 percent to 10,180 yen after KBC Securities raised its rating on the Uniqlo store operator to "buy" from "hold," while lowering its target price to 11,100 yen from 11,500 yen. Astellas shares added 0.9 percent to 3,300 yen after Nikko Citigroup raised its rating on the stock to "buy/medium risk" from "hold/medium risk," saying the drugmaker's upwardly revised targets for the year to March were conservative. Among stocks that fell, West Japan Railway slid 2.3 percent to 339,000 yen after UBS Investment Research cut its rating to "sell" from "neutral" and cut the price target to 300,000 yen from 420,000 yen. "In light of the sharp deterioration of the macro environment, we have revised down our railway revenue estimates sharply. As the stock looks expensive relative to its peers, we are downgrading our rating," wrote analyst Jun Harada. Trade was light on the Tokyo exchange's first section, with 1.86 billion shares changing hands, compared with last week's daily average of 1.92 billion. Advancing stocks outnumbered declining ones by 884 to 707. (Reporting by Aiko Hayashi; Editing by  Hugh Lawson )
