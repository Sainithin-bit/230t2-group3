 ATLANTA  (Reuters) - Appliance maker Whirlpool Corp and other companies have received subpoenas in a global investigation into possible price-fixing of compressors. 

 Whirlpool, whose shares fell more than 6 percent on Thursday, said it received a grand jury subpoena from the U.S. Department of Justice. Tecumseh Products Co said earlier this week that it had been contacted. "The Antitrust Division is investigating the possibility of anti-competitive practices in the compressor industry," a spokeswoman for the U.S. Department of Justice said. "We are coordinating with other foreign competition authorities." Additionally, Brazil's federal police said in a statement it had served six search warrants in Sao Paulo and Santa Catarina states to gather evidence of an alleged cartel in cooling compressors. Nearly 60 federal police agents, Justice ministry antitrust officials and state prosecutors took part. "The initial investigation shows that companies involved had agreed, through their managers, to fix price increases and also exchanged commercially sensitive information, harming free competition and consumers," Brazil police said in the statement. Whirlpool, the world's top appliance maker, said it received the U.S. subpoena on Tuesday. That same day, antitrust authorities visited Whirlpool's subsidiaries in Brazil and Italy asking for similar information, the company added. Whirlpool, which faced lengthy U.S. antitrust scrutiny in its 2006 buyout of Maytag, gave no further details on the compressor investigations, but said it will cooperate fully. It added it does not know of any charges filed against the company or its employees. On Wednesday, compressor maker Tecumseh Products disclosed it had received a U.S. Justice Department subpoena and formal information request from the Secretariat of Economic Law of Brazil's Justice Ministry. It said the European Commission has also begun an investigation of the compressor industry. Tecumseh said it does not expect the inquiries to affect its operations or ability to compete in any material way. Whirlpool shares were off $1.94 or 6.7 percent at $26.99 on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday, while Tecumseh was up 12 cents, or 1.8 percent, at $6.72 on the Nasdaq.
