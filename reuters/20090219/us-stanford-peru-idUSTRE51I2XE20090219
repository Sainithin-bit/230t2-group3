 LIMA  (Reuters) - Peru's securities regulator said on Thursday it suspended the operations of the local office of Stanford Financial Group for 30 days after U.S. authorities charged it with perpetrating a "massive" fraud. 

 Regulator Conasev said it was working to make sure clients received their cash, a day after nervous investors lined up at the company's office in Lima. It also said Stanford's Peru office was only allowed to operate as a broker-dealer, and it was not clear whether Peruvian clients were sold the high-yielding certificates of deposit at the core of the $8 billion scandal. Stanford, operating as a broker-dealer in Lima, has net assets in Peru of 6.8 million soles ($2.1 million), according to regulator Conasev.
