 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said on Wednesday he expects the alleged frauds involving Texas billionaire Allen Stanford and Wall Street veteran Bernard Madoff will be the largest that authorities uncover. 

 Asked whether there would be more cases of that scale and scope, Holder told reporters, "It's hard to say. I'd like to think that those are going to be the largest." Stanford has been accused of an $8 billion fraud involving certificates of deposit, while Madoff has been charged with a $50 billion Ponzi scheme. Asked why the Justice Department has not filed criminal charges against Stanford, Holder said, "I'm not sure I can comment on that right now." The Justice Department would be "vigilant" in seeking to detect the kind of fraud alleged in the Stanford and Madoff cases, Holder told reporters at the Justice Department. "We've been working with our law enforcement counterparts to try to make sure those people are detected and also held accountable," Holder said. Holder also said the Justice Department was considering setting up a mortgage fraud task force, an idea his predecessor in the Bush administration opposed. The department was "looking at what we have done and what we can do" to prosecute mortgage fraud, he said. (Reporting by  James Vicini , Editing by Patricia Zengerle and Jeffrey Benkoe)
