 LONDON  (Reuters) - World stocks rose from the previous day's three-month low on Thursday while the dollar and government bonds fell after European corporate quarterly results came in better than the most pessimistic expectations. 

 Oil also rose, but European stocks erased early gains after investors shifted focus firms including AXA ( AXAF.PA ), which fell 9 percent after Europe's biggest insurer's results failed to erase concerns about the firm's balance sheet. Nestle ( NESN.VX ) the world's biggest food group, beat forecasts with underlying sales growth of 8.3 percent in 2008 and it was cautiously upbeat for 2009. BNP Paribas ( BNPP.PA )'s fourth-quarter loss of 1.37 billion euros ($1.73 billion) was in line with last month's guidance. Austria's Raiffeisen International RIBH.VI, eastern Europe's second biggest bank, reported a 17 percent rise in 2008 net profits. While European stocks almost erased earlier gains, U.S. stock futures rose up to 1 percent, improving investor morale. "There are some rays of lights such as Nestle showing that consumption in Europe is not as bad as feared yet," said Hans-Juergen Delp, strategist at Commerzbank. MSCI world equity index .MIWD00000PUS rose 0.6 percent, having hit a three-month low on Wednesday. The FTSEurofirst 300 index of leading European shares  .FTEU3  was steady on the day. Emerging stocks .MSCIEF gained 1 percent. U.S. stock futures were up around 1 percent. U.S. crude oil rose 2.8 percent to $35.60 a barrel. Euro zone government bonds fell, following losses in U.S. Treasuries, after President Barack Obama's $275 billion plan to prop up the housing market fueled expectations that the government would increase public borrowing. "Another day, another initiative," Calyon said in a note to clients. "This is how it sometimes feels, and it is perhaps no surprise that markets are becoming a bit exhausted at trying to discern the impact of whatever the latest announcement, policy or program might be." The March bund futures fell 60 ticks. The dollar .DXY fell 0.9 percent against a basket of major currencies. The yen rose 0.3 percent to 93.56 per dollar, after hitting a six-week low on the previous day. The Bank of Japan extended its deadline for buying commercial paper to help corporate funding after leaving its key policy rate unchanged at 0.1 percent as expected. Gold fell to $976.05 an ounce, having hit a seven-month peak of $985.95 earlier. (Additional reporting by  Blaise Robinson ; Editing by Victoria Main)
