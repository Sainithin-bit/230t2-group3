 JEDDAH, Saudi Arabia  (Reuters) - Qatar Oil Minister Abdullah al-Attiyah said on Sunday the world market was well supplied with crude and near record-high oil prices were the result of speculation. 

 "There is enough oil in the market," he said. "Prices are being driven by speculation." Top officials and policymakers from the world's biggest oil producers and consumers, plus chief executives of leading oil companies, are meeting in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, on Sunday for emergency talks on how to tame oil's ascent.
