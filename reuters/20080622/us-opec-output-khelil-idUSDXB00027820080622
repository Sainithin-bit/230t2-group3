 DUBAI  (Reuters) - OPEC producers should wait until September to decide any change to current oil output levels as supply was adequate, OPEC President Chakib Khelil said on Sunday. 

 "We have to wait until September and take our decision there (OPEC ministers meeting)," Khelil, also Algeria's energy minister, told Al Arabiya television on the sidelines of a meeting in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia of oil producers and consumers. "This is not an OPEC meeting. This is a meeting called by the Saudi government and we are here to discuss the problem of prices ... there is no problem in supply and no problem in inventories," he added, when asked if the oil group could agree an increase of production during the Jeddah meeting.
