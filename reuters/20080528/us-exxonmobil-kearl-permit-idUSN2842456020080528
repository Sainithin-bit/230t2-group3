 DALLAS  (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson said on Wednesday he was optimistic the Canadian government would approve the reinstatement of a permit to develop the Kearl oil sands project in Alberta. 

 The U.S. major is partnered with Imperial Oil Ltd in the project. Earlier in May, the companies failed in a court bid to have the permit reinstated. It was revoked in March by Canada's Department of Fisheries and Oceans after another court sent Kearl's environmental approval back to regulators for explanation.
