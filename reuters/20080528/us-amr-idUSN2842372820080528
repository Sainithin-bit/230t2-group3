 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - American Airlines will end service between New York's JFK International Airport and London's Stansted Airport as part of a plan to cut capacity to better cope with soaring fuel prices, the airline's parent, AMR Corp, said on Wednesday. 

 The Stansted service will end on July 2, but American will continue to offer service between JFK and London's Heathrow Airport, AMR said. The news comes a day after American said it would end Chicago flights to Honolulu and Buenos Aires. The cuts are part of an effort by AMR to cut capacity and better manage fares and operations. Last week it said it would reduce domestic capacity by 11 percent to 12 percent. The airline industry is battling soaring fuel costs and a weakening economy that threatens to erode travel demand. AMR said it would make further cuts to its schedule in other markets and retire 40 to 45 mainline aircraft and 35 to 40 regional jets. (Reporting by Kyle Peterson; editing by John Wallace)
