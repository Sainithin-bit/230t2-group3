 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Treasury debt prices fell on Wednesday after a key barometer of business investment posted a surprisingly sharp gain last month, dimming fears the United States is in a recession. 

 Worries over rising inflation, spurred by high food and energy costs, added to the negative tone for bonds. Benchmark yields climbed to their highest level since the start of the year after data showing new orders for long-lasting manufactured goods fell less than expected in April. Within the Commerce Department's durable goods report, non-defense capital orders excluding aircraft, which is seen as a key gauge of business investment, rose by 4.2 percent, marking the biggest increase since December. Analysts said that while the U.S. economy is clearly struggling, the stronger-than-expected durable goods orders was evidence that the country may not be mired in a recession. "You strip out defense and aircraft and you had a 4.2 percent pop. It really becomes hard to suggest that we have got a full-fledged recession here," said T.J. Marta, fixed income strategist at RBC Capital Markets in New York. Any signs of better news for the economy is bad news for bonds, and benchmark 10-year Treasury notes were trading 20/32 lower in price for a yield of 3.998 percent from 3.921 percent late on Tuesday. Ten-year yields briefly edged above 4.00 percent late on Wednesday morning, marking the highest level since January 2. The 2-year Treasury note was trading 4/32 lower in price for a yield of 2.587 percent from 2.515 percent. While the durable goods orders data was the immediate catalyst for the bond market sell-off on Wednesday, concerns about rising inflation also weighed on government debt prices. "The durables number was better than expected -- that, combined with the ongoing inflation concerns is seeing the 10-year note test its key 4 percent area," said Josh Stiles, bond strategist with IDEAglobal in New York. Inflation erodes a bond's value over time, and analysts expect price pressure will force the Federal Reserve to reverse its monetary loosening campaign and to raise interest rates before the end of the year. Investors are now looking for further market direction based on the reception of an auction of $30 billion of 2-year Treasury notes on Wednesday afternoon. Five-year Treasury notes were trading 13/32 lower in price for a yield of 3.316 percent from 3.225 percent late on Tuesday, while the 30-year bond was 30/32 lower for a yield of 4.703 percent from 4.643 percent.
