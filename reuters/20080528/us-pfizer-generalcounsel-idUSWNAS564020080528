 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc ( PFE.N ) on Wednesday named Amy Schulman, who has led litigation efforts for the drugmaker involving its painkillers Celebrex and Bextra, as its general counsel. 

 Schulman, whose appointment is effective June 23, joins Pfizer from DLA Piper, where she was a partner and co-leader of the firm's mass tort/class action practice. In March, Pfizer said its general counsel, Allen Waxman, was leaving the company for personal reasons. (Reporting by  Lewis Krauskopf , editing by Gerald E. McCormick)
