 CARLSBAD, California  (Reuters) - Expedia Inc ( EXPE.O ) Chairman Barry Diller on Wednesday dismissed newly resurfaced rumors that the online travel site would be taken private and blamed speculators for trying to make a quick buck. 

 Asked by a reporter whether to believe rumors that he wanted to take the company private, Diller replied: "I wouldn't." "I am so suspect of current markets and the hedge funds and momentum selling/buying," Diller said. "I think there is a plot behind everything." Diller holds about 60 percent of Expedia shares, according to a company proxy filing. He was speaking on the sidelines of the D: All Things Digital conference, an annual gathering of the high-tech industry elite taking place near San Diego. Shares of the top U.S. online travel agent jumped as much as 9.5 percent to $23.81 in trading on Nasdaq earlier in the day. The shares gave back some of those gains on Diller's comments and closed at $22.75, up 4.65 percent on the day. Option traders and analysts said leveraged buyout talk involving Diller, who is also chairman and chief executive of former Expedia parent company IAC/InterActiveCorp ( IACI.O ), has sparked heavy interest in Expedia's upside call options. "There is speculation that Barry Diller is interested in taking Expedia private," said William Lefkowitz, an options strategist at brokerage firm vFinance Investments in New York. During an on-stage interview at the D: conference with journalist blogger Kara Swisher, Diller could not contain his contempt for short-term speculators trying to influence his stock. "In Long Island this weekend, I was with a bunch of hedge people. I went to some lunch. It was just all of them, all of those arrogant people. They don't have any product. They just make money," the always outspoken media mogul said. Diller, the top executive at e-commerce conglomerate IAC, also confirmed that he believes the company is on track with its previously announced plans to split the company into five separate businesses. "Nothing has told us otherwise," he said, adding that IAC was still awaiting the formal go-ahead from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission after recently filing its plans.
