 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Inverness Medical Innovations Inc IMA.A said on Wednesday it was in talks with private equity groups about a proposed joint venture of its health management business for which it would receive about $1.2 billion, sending its stock up nearly 10 percent. 

 Inverness said the venture would include recently acquired Matria Healthcare, Alere Medical and Paradigm Health, but not its Quality Assured Services business. The unnamed private equity sponsors would receive 50 percent interest in the joint venture based on an enterprise valuation of about $1.8 billion, Inverness said in a filing to securities regulators. Under terms of the proposed venture, Inverness would receive about $600 million in capital paid by the private equity sponsors and about $600 million from senior debt borrowed by the joint venture, the company said. The joint venture would be run as an independent entity with Inverness appointing three directors to a six-member board, the Waltham, Massachusetts-based company said. The company cautioned that there can be no assurance that an agreement would be reached or that any final joint venture deal would be set up according to the proposed terms outlined in its filing. Inverness makes diagnostic tests for use in cardiology, oncology, infectious diseases and women's health. Inverness shares rose $2.51, or 7.7 percent, to $34.97 on the American Stock Exchange after climbing as high as $35.66. (Reporting by  Bill Berkrot , editing by Richard Chang)
