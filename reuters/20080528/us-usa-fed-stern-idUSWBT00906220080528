 ALTOONA, Wisconsin  (Reuters) - A top Federal Reserve policy-maker on Wednesday said the U.S. central bank must withdraw its powerful policy easing at some stage to keep inflation contained, suggesting his sights were turning toward the eventual need to raise interest rates. 

 "Inflation expectations have remained reasonably well anchored so far, which is encouraging," Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank President Gary Stern told a local business group. "But the key to maintaining low inflation and inflation expectations is likely to be the timeliness and magnitude of decisions we make to reverse course," he said. Stern, a voting member of the Fed's policy-setting committee this year, was referring to the 3.25 percentage points the Fed has cut from its benchmark overnight federal funds rate since mid-September to shield the U.S. economy from a housing crisis. "We are highly sensitive to this issue. I am confident that we will conduct policy in an appropriate and timely manner," he said. The Fed cut rates by a quarter percentage point to 2 percent at its last policy meeting at the end of April but signaled that, absent unexpected shocks, it had paused its campaign to cut rates. Investors think it will start interest raising rates before the end of this year. "I think the Federal Reserve has taken appropriate policy steps to respond to a significant financial shock, the shock that rendered some markets illiquid, and which has affected the economic outlook negatively," Stern said. "In this environment, policy needs to remain sensitive to evolving financial conditions and to incoming information on business activity," he said. Stern warned that the downturn in the U.S. housing market might be steeper than in the early 1990s, when the United States suffered a relatively painful recession. As a result, he said the inventory of unsold homes remained large and economic growth would likely be modest, which would push up unemployment somewhat. Stern also was doubtful that a fiscal stimulus package that has already begun delivering rebate checks would provide an economic boost that lasted more than one or two quarters. Although emergency measures to unfreeze financial markets panicked by subprime mortgage losses had helped, Stern made plain that the climate was not yet normal. "While conditions in many (markets) have shown signs of improvement ... some markets remain dysfunctional," he said. On a more hawkish note, Stern said high energy and food prices had pushed up overall inflation at a faster pace than was comfortable, although prices were better behaved at the core level when these volatile components were stripped out. "Right now, I think we are seeing challenges on both sides of that (dual mandate) and I think we are simply going to have to navigate the minefield," he said, referring to the Fed's duty to deliver price stability and sustainable growth. "We want to see what kind of progress is being made in terms of returning financial conditions something closer to normal, and looking at the incoming information on the economy as well," he said in response to a question after the speech.
