 BONN, Germany  (Reuters) - German mail and logistics group Deutsche Post ( DPWGn.DE ) plans to partner with rival UPS ( UPS.N ) and spend up to $2 billion to restructure its loss-making DHL Express business in the United States. 

 The U.S. unit would record an underlying operating loss of $1.3 billion this year, reducing to $300 million in 2011, Deutsche Post told a news conference at its headquarters on Wednesday. "We have promised to relentlessly focus on improving financial performance," Deutsche Post Chief Executive Frank Appel said. "I am confident we have found a sustainable way forward for U.S. Express." UPS will provide air transport for DHL packages within the United States and for international shipments within North America under a proposed contract between the two companies. DHL Express also planned to cut its network capacity by 30 percent and lower overhead and administration costs. Up to 10 percent of Express staff would be affected, Post said. The restructuring plan would lead to annual cost savings of about $1 billion at U.S. Express, Deutsche Post said. "First positive effects of the plan will start showing already in 2009," the company said. Due to the uncertain economic situation in the U.S., Deutsche Post said it was reducing its guidance for underlying EBIT (earnings before interest and tax) at the global DHL Express division in 2008 to around 400 million euros ($628.9 million) from around 500 million. As a result, it cut the group's full-year EBIT guidance before non-recurring effects and restructuring costs by 100 million euros to around 4.1 billion euros. Guidance for 2009 remained unchanged, Post added. Deutsche Post shares were 3 percent lower at 20.95 euros by 8:37 a.m. EDT (1237 GMT). (Reporting by  James Regan ; Editing by Quentin Bryar)
