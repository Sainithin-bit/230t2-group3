 BONN, Germany  (Reuters) - German mail group Deutsche Post AG plans to partner with rival United Parcel Service Inc (UPS) as part of a $2 billion restructuring of its loss-making DHL Express business in the United States. 

 UPS will provide air transport for DHL packages within the United States and for international shipments within North America under a proposed 10-year contract, which will affect up to 1,800 DHL Express jobs. "We have promised to relentlessly focus on improving financial performance," Deutsche Post Chief Executive Frank Appel told a news conference on Wednesday. "I am confident we have found a sustainable way forward for U.S. Express ... I believe we have a win-win situation. We are convinced that both companies will profit from it." Appel said the U.S. unit would make an underlying operating loss of $1.3 billion this year, falling to $300 million in 2011. DHL Express plans to cut its network capacity by 30 percent and to lower overhead and administration costs. Up to 10 percent of U.S. Express staff would be affected. The restructuring plan would lead to annual cost savings of about $1 billion at U.S. Express. First positive effects of the plan would start showing in 2009. Deutsche Post also said it was reducing its guidance for underlying EBIT (earnings before interest and tax) at the global DHL Express division in 2008 to around 400 million euros ($628.9 million) from around 500 million, due to the uncertain economic situation in the United States. TOP PRIORITY And it cut its group full-year EBIT forecast before one-time effects and restructuring costs by 100 million euros to around 4.1 billion. Guidance for 2009 remained unchanged. "In this case, we'd rather a painful ending than endless pain," NordLB analyst Martina Noss said. Deutsche Post shares closed down 5.4 percent at 20.42 euros, making them the worst performers on the German blue-chip DAX index, which finished 1.1 percent firmer. UPS said it expected a final contract later this year that would produce up to $1 billion in additional revenue for UPS. The agreement would not involve the pick-up or delivery of DHL packages, only their transport, primarily between airports. "We want to emphasize that this would be a relatively straightforward air-lift agreement and that UPS and DHL will continue to compete in the marketplace under their own brands," David Abney, UPS's chief operating officer, said in a statement. UPS shares were up $2.26, or 3.3 percent, at $70.66 by 12:30 p.m. EDT (1630 GMT) in New York. Evan Stewart, an antitrust lawyer with the firm Zuckerman, Spaeder LLP, said the deal between DHL and UPS could yet hit stumbling blocks with the regulatory authorities in the U.S. "If the Department of Justice goes with the express delivery market, which is what the deal is supposedly aimed at, if there's an agreement that that's the appropriate market then it's more likely that that will go through," he said. "If it's defined more broadly ... then it's not so likely." Appel, who was catapulted to the helm of Deutsche Post in February after predecessor Klaus Zumwinkel stepped down amid a tax-dodging probe, had pledged to find a solution for the U.S. business as his top priority. The unit ran into problems in the United States as it consolidated its operations into one air hub in Wilmington, Ohio, and sought to take on dominant domestic rivals UPS and FedEx in their own back yard. The unit's recovery was subsequently hampered by the slowdown in the U.S. economy, which prompted Deutsche Post to abandon a target for DHL Express to break even there in 2009 and to take a 600 million-euro writedown on the business. Deutsche Post had said it must keep a presence in the U.S. as part of its global DHL Express network. Appel's other major strategic pledge has been to decide what to do with its Postbank retail bank unit. Post finance chief John Allan said on Wednesday it was more important to get it right than to decide quickly. "We are going to coolly and calmly consider what is the right thing to do and not rush into decisions," he said. "Postbank is a very high quality asset, and frankly we will have to take our time to decide what is the right thing to do and when is the right time to do it."
