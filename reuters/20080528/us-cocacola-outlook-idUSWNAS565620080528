 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co ( KO.N ), the world's largest soft-drink company, on Wednesday said it is confident in its global business outlook for the second quarter and full year, citing strength in its international operations. 

 The company made the comment after its largest bottler, Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc ( CCE.N ), said it expected second-quarter profit to fall due to the weak U.S. economy. (Reporting by  Brad Dorfman , editing by Gerald E. McCormick)
