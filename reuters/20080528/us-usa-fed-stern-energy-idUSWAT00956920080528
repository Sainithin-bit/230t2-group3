 ALTOONA, Wisconsin  (Reuters) - Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank President Gary Stern on Wednesday cautioned against drawing a link between the dollar's decline and lofty energy prices, saying strong demand has been a factor. 

 "I'd be careful about mistaking correlation and causation. Just because energy prices and the dollar seem to move together ... doesn't mean that there's causation there," Stern said in answer to a question after addressing the Chamber of Commerce here. "If you're thinking about energy prices ... it's important to bear in mind that there's been some very significant changes in the global economy that probably have something to do with this and I would point to the very rapid growth in China and India in recent years, and places like that," he added.
