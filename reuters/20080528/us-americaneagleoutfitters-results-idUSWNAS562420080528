 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Teen apparel retailer American Eagle Outfitters Inc ( AEO.N ) said on Wednesday quarterly net profit fell, hurt by greater markdowns resulting from lower-than-expected sales. 

 The mall-based chain, known for colorful, casual fashions, said net profit in the first quarter was $43.9 million, or 21 cents per share, compared with $78.8 million, or 35 cents per share a year earlier. (Reporting by  Martinne Geller ; Editing by  Derek Caney )
