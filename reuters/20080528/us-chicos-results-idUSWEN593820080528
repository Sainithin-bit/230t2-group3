 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Women's apparel retailer Chico's FAS Inc ( CHS.N ) posted a sharply lower net quarterly profit on Wednesday, as it grappled with declining sales. 

 Net profit was $12.7 million, or 7 cents per share in the first quarter that ended May 3, compared with $47.2 million, or 27 cents per share, a year earlier. (Reporting by  Aarthi Sivaraman ; Editing by  Derek Caney )
