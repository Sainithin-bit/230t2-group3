 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Beverage bottler Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc ( CCE.N ) on Wednesday said it expected a mid to high single-digit percentage decline in second-quarter profits, excluding one-time items, citing the weak U.S. economy. 

 It also said it would be challenging to meet its full-year earnings forecast if current economic and market trends did not improve. The world's largest bottler of Coca-Cola Co ( KO.N ) beverages said the weakening U.S. economy was cutting into sales volume, especially in higher-margin 20-ounce bottles.
