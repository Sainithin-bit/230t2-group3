 ALTOONA, Wisconsin  (Reuters) - Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank President Gary Stern said on Wednesday he was considering whether U.S. monetary policy should be employed to fight asset bubbles. 

 "While I have not yet changed my opinion that asset price levels should not be an objective of monetary policy, I'm reviewing this conclusion in the wake of the fallout from the decline in house prices and from the earlier collapse of prices of technology stocks," Stern said in a speech to the Chamber of Commerce here. "I think it is important to reconsider these conclusions in light of recent events where it has proven to be neither easy nor costless to deal with the aftermath of unsustainably high asset prices," he said.
