 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Route cuts at American Airlines will start with discontinuing some long-haul service, including Chicago flights to Honolulu and Buenos Aires, the carrier said on Tuesday. 

 American, a unit of AMR Corp, also will cut service between Boston and San Diego, effective September 3. Flights from O'Hare airport in Chicago to Buenos Aires will cease on September 3 as well, while Chicago-Honolulu service will end on January 5, 2009. AMR will also restructure American and American Eagle operations at San Juan, Puerto Rico, beginning in September. Customers will be notified beginning next week and reaccommodated on other flights, American said. More changes are expected in the coming weeks to achieve the company's goal of reducing fourth-quarter mainline domestic capacity by 11 percent to 12 percent to help offset skyrocketing fuel costs. Regional capacity is also coming down. (Reporting by  John Crawley ; Editing by  Gary Hill )
