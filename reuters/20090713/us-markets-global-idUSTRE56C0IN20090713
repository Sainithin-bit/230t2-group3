 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Global stocks snapped back on Monday following positive comments on financial shares from an influential bank analyst who is normally bearish, while the U.S. dollar rebounded off a five-month low against the yen. 

 Prices of U.S. Treasuries, which had traded mixed, turned lower after the U.S. government announced a $94.32 billion budget deficit in June, a record for the month. Oil prices briefly touched their lowest level in almost two months, slipping below $59 a barrel, on lingering concerns over the global economy. But copper prices and New York gold futures reversed initial losses to trade higher, taking their lead from the rally on Wall Street, which lifted stocks more than 2 percent. Hopes that U.S. earnings may not be as weak as initially feared sparked the stock rally and helped the euro to rise broadly. Wall Street analyst Meredith Whitney upgraded Goldman Sachs Group Inc ( GS.N ) to "buy" and told New York-based business television station CNBC that bank shares were in for at least a short-term gain of 15 percent. Major financials, including Bank of America Corp ( BAC.N ) and JPMorgan Chase & Co ( JPM.N ), could do well in the second quarter, she said. The S&P Financial Index .GSPF gained 6.5 percent, while Goldman rose 5.3 percent, Bank of America surged 9.3 percent and JPMorgan climbed 7.3 percent. European shares rallied, recouping some of last week's steep losses, as banks tracked advances in U.S. financials. "For today at least, people have optimism about the earnings season," said James Meyer, chief investment officer of Tower Bridge Advisors in West Conshohocken, Pennsylvania. "I think what you're going to hear in the second quarter is that earnings will be better than expected and management is going to express some kind of optimism, though the top line won't be very good," Meyer said. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  closed up 185.16 points, or 2.27 percent, at 8,331.68. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  gained 21.92 points, or 2.49 percent, at 901.05. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  added 37.18 points, or 2.12 percent, at 1,793.21. The FTSEurofirst 300  .FTEU3  index of top European shares closed up 2.0 percent at 830.19 points. The euro also gained after European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet sounded a bit more upbeat about euro-zone growth for the rest of 2009. The equity rally and Trichet's comments helped reverse earlier gains for the yen and dollar, which tend to rise when investors grow anxious and sell risky assets that often are financed with cheaply-borrowed dollars and yen. "We've had quite a turnaround here as people have received some reassurance on earnings, though there are still hurdles ahead," said Camilla Sutton, senior currency strategist at Scotia Capital in Toronto. The euro was up 0.44 percent at $1.3991. The dollar was down against a basket of major currencies, with the U.S. Dollar Index .DXY down 0.25 percent at 80.033. Against the yen, the dollar was up 0.46 percent at 92.95. U.S. crude oil for August delivery fell 20 cents to settle at $59.69 a barrel. Earlier it fell to a low of $58.32, the lowest since May 18. London Brent rose 17 cents to $60.69 a barrel. Crude oil dropped 11 percent last week in its biggest weekly decline since late January as investors raised the possibility of another economic dip before any recovery, which could delay a rebound in demand for fuel. Many analysts remain cautious about the economic outlook, saying that recovery could be protracted and difficult. "There is a great deal of uncertainty," said Fairfax investment bank analyst John Meyer, adding that the market was seeking firmer direction. "There is clearly more negative news to come out of the manufacturing industry." The August futures contract for gold settled up $10 at $922.50 an ounce in New York. The rise in stocks eroded any safe-haven bid for government debt, while the growing U.S. budget deficit ushered in fears of future inflation, the bane of fixed-income investors because rising prices erode the value of bonds and other debt. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note was down 16/32 in price to yield 3.36 percent. The 2-year U.S. Treasury note was unchanged in price to yield 0.90 percent. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note fell 4/32 in price to yield 3.31 percent. But the 2-year U.S. Treasury note rose 1/32 in price to yield 0.88 percent. Asian shares fell 2.6 percent, with Japan's Nikkei down for a ninth straight day, as concerns about company earnings outlooks weighed. The Nikkei average  .N225  fell 2.6 percent to an eight-week low, MSCI's measure of stocks elsewhere in the Asia-Pacific .MIAPJ0000PUS also fell 2.6 percent.
