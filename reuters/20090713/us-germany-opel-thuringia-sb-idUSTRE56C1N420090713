 BERLIN  (Reuters) - The four German states with Opel plants have reservations about Belgian holding company RHJ International taking a stake in the European unit of U.S. carmaker General motors, the state of Thuringia said on Monday. 

 "Magna is still the best solution, the second best would be Fiat," Thuringia's Economy Minister Juergen Reinholz told Reuters, adding that he believed a deal with Canadian auto parts group Magna and GM on Opel could be possible this month. (Reporting by Rene Wagner)
