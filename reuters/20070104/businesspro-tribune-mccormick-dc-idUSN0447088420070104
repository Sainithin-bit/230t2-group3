 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - McCormick Tribune Foundation, one of 
the largest shareholders in media group Tribune Co. TRB.N, 
said in a regulatory filing on Thursday it is evaluating its 
investment in light of Tribune's strategic assessment. 

  Tribune, which owns 11 daily newspapers including the 
Chicago Tribune and Los Angeles Times as well and operates 23 
television stations, is in the middle of a review that could 
result in the company's sale or the spin-off of various 
divisions.  The foundation said in a filing with the U.S. Securities 
and Exchange Commission that it has established an advisory 
committee, hired the Blackstone Group as its financial adviser 
and signed an agreement to obtain confidential Tribune 
information to conduct its evaluation.  The foundation owns an 11.7 percent stake, or about 28 
million common shares, in Tribune stock.  It said it reserves the right to take actions such as 
buying or selling Tribune stock in the open market, in block 
trades and in privately negotiated transactions, and pursuing 
alternative transactions.  There have been reports that Tribune's largest shareholder, 
the Chandler family, is eyeing a bid of its own with 
billionaire investor Ron Burkle's firm Yucaipa Cos.
