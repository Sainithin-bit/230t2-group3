 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Gap Inc. ( GPS.N ) said on Thursday that it is taking a good look at its Gap and Old Navy chains, and cut its full-year profit forecast again because December sales were weaker than expected. 

 "We are clearly disappointed with Gap and Old Navy's holiday sales and overall performance for the year," President and Chief Executive Paul Pressler said in a statement. Pressler said management is reviewing Gap and Old Navy's brand strategies with "active involvement" from the board. The review comes less than three months after Gap brought in a new president for the Old Navy chain. Gap has also replaced a number of executives at its core Gap chain and shares jumped last month amid market speculation that Pressler would step down. "I think that they have lost their way," said Patricia Edwards, a portfolio manager at Wentworth, Hauser and Violich, who tracks retailers. "I think that there is talent out there that can turn around that company, however, it's out there, not in there." Gap's shares seesawed as investors tried to determine whether the outcome of the review could be enough to turn around months of sales declines. "They've had a couple years now of poor performance in those divisions and they've had a certain strategy, which has not worked, so I think it's a very smart move to review what the strategy is," CL King & Associates retail analyst Mark Montagna said. The company has lost its footing as discount department stores such as Target Corp. ( TGT.N ) have stolen away shoppers with lower priced basic apparel, while teens have turned to chains such as Abercrombie & Fitch Co. ( ANF.N ) and American Eagle Outfitters Inc. AEOS.O. Also, Gap's swings from wardrobe staples to fashionable offerings back to basic jeans and T-shirts have confused previously loyal customers, sending them elsewhere. Though the company has rolled out aggressive ad campaigns, brought in a slew of new designers and streamlined its inventory systems, sales have continued to slide. "Ultimately, they probably need to do a better job of injecting fashion into their merchandise and perhaps even improve the quality," said Montagna, who has an "underperform" rating on Gap. "But there's just no simple answer." The company said that it expects to provide an updated view on its approach for 2007 no later than the year-end earnings conference call set for March 1. SALES SLIDE CONTINUES In the past two years, Gap's same-store sales have only risen once, when Gap posted a surprise 1 percent rise in January 2006, helped by demand for spring merchandise. Sales at stores open at least a year fell 8 percent in December as the company was forced to slash prices to drive sales at the Gap and Old Navy chains. Analysts had been expecting the San Francisco-based clothing retailer to post a same-store sales decrease of between 1 percent and 6 percent, with an average view of a 4.2-percent decrease, according to a Reuters survey. The heavy discounts at Gap and Old Navy led to a significant decline in overall merchandise margins. Gap said it expects margin pressure to continue into January as it clears out the remaining holiday merchandise. Same-store sales at the Gap in North America fell 9 percent, Old Navy's North American sales fell 10 percent and international sales were off 8 percent. The only chain posting an increase was the upscale Banana Republic, where North America sales rose 2 percent. Total sales for the five weeks that ended December 30 fell 4 percent to $2.34 billion. The company now expects to earn 83 cents to 87 cents per share this year, down from its mid-November forecast of $1.01 to $1.06 per share. It had previously called for full-year earnings of $1.08 to $1.12 per share. Analysts, on average, had expected Gap to earn $1.01 per share this year. Shares of Gap were up 5 cents at $19.36 after rising to $19.75 and falling to $18.80 in New York Stock Exchange trading. (Additional reporting by  Nicole Maestri  in New York)
