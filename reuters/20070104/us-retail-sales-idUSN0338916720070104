 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. retailers posted disappointing December sales on Thursday, hurt by warm weather and procrastinating shoppers who waited for deep discounts before wrapping up their holiday purchases. 

 The lackluster sales now shift the focus to January, when retailers expect consumers to redeem gift cards. Retailers, who can only book revenue after the cards are used, count on customers spending more once they walk through their doors. "Most retailers gain 70 to 80 percent of gift card redemptions within the first two weeks following Christmas," said J.& W. Seligman & Co. equity analyst Chris Kagaoan. "That should benefit sales overall in the first part of January." But for some retailers, the likely gift card redemptions will not be enough to overcome December's weakness. AnnTaylor Stores Corp. ( ANN.N ), Federated Department Stores Inc. FD.N, and Chico's FAS Inc. ( CHS.N ) warned that their sales or earnings for the fourth quarter or fiscal year ending in January could be less than expected. Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ( WMT.N ) maintained its fourth-quarter profit forecast, which was in doubt after its U.S. sales at stores open at least a year fell in November. The retailer said December sales at U.S. stores open at least a year -- known as same-store sales -- rose 1.6 percent, but it only forecast a 1 to 2 percent rise in January U.S. same-store sales. Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics, said December marks the third straight month that the majority of retailers missed sales expectations. Overall, December same-store sales rose 3.2 percent, according to Retail Metrics, compared with a 3.4 percent rise a year ago. According to the International Council of Shopping Centers, combined November and December same-store sales at U.S. chain stores rose 2.8 percent. That was within the ICSC's forecast for a 2.5 to 3.0 percent rise but trailed last year's 3.6 percent gain. Investors are keeping a close eye on sales to see if the slowdown in the housing market will take a bite out consumer spending, which accounts for roughly two-thirds of U.S. economic activity. Perkins said consumer spending seemed "subdued," and the results were "a little bit concerning as we head into '07." The S&P Retail Index .RLX, which bounced between positive and negative territory, finished the trading session almost flat at 502.77. TRACKING DECEMBER SALES Investors carefully watch retailers' holiday sales, because the November and December period can account for 20 percent to 40 percent of annual revenues. The holiday season got off to a strong start during the three-day post-Thanksgiving weekend as retailers opened their doors before dawn. Customers lined up as early as midnight to take advantage of "doorbuster" bargains, like 42-inch plasma TVs priced below $1,000. But after cherry-picking sale items during the Thanksgiving weekend, consumers took a break at the beginning of December, waiting for stores to entice them with last-minute discounts. The weather did not help apparel sales. Last month was the warmest December in the United States in at least 10 years, according to weather tracking firm Planalytics. Kohl's Corp. ( KSS.N ) Chairman and Chief Executive Larry Montgomery said last-minute shoppers and gift-card redemptions spurred sales in the final two weeks of December, which helped offset weak demand for items like sweaters and boots. But AnnTaylor said December was its "most challenging" month of the year, and sweater, outerwear and accessory sales at its Ann Taylor Loft stores were "especially disappointing." Gap Inc.'s ( GPS.N ) December sales at stores open at least a year fell a worse-than-expected 8 percent after it resorted to markdowns to drive shoppers into its Gap and Old Navy stores. The struggling retailer cut its fiscal year outlook, and said it is reviewing Gap and Old Navy brand strategies. CUTTING PRICES, BUYING ELECTRONICS Wal-Mart said its December apparel sales were "soft," but by cutting prices it helped boost sales. It also noted that sales of electronics -- one of the holiday season's hottest categories -- were strong. Wal-Mart has been aggressively promoting flat-panel televisions, hoping to steal sales of the high-priced items from consumer electronics retailers like Best Buy Co. Inc. ( BBY.N ) and Circuit City Stores Inc. CC.N. They will report December sales on Friday. "Electronics was the first place that people went and spent their money" this holiday, said Patricia Edwards, a portfolio manager at Wentworth, Hauser and Violich. "It was all about iPods, digital cameras, but mostly flat-panel TVs and the stuff that goes with them." TV demand also helped sales at Costco Wholesale Corp. ( COST.O ). The largest U.S. warehouse club operator posted a better-than-expected 9 percent gain in December same-store sales, citing strength in its TV sales. Upscale department store operators performed well, with Saks Inc.'s SKS.N and Nordstrom Inc.'s ( JWN.N ) December same-store sales beating expectations.
