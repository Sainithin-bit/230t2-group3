 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Pier 1 Imports Inc. ( PIR.N ) said on 
Thursday that December sales fell 10.7 percent at stores open 
at least a year as an aggressive marketing campaign and 
revamped merchandise offerings failed to boost store traffic 
for the holiday season. 

  Analysts on average expected the struggling home decor 
retailer to post a same-store sales decline of 11 percent, 
according to a Reuters poll.  December marks Pier 1's 11th straight month of declining 
same-store sales.  "Continued difficulties are disappointing as we continue to 
believe numerous merchandise and marketing initiatives (are) 
not gaining in traction, alienating the once loyal Pier 1 
customer," Lehman Brothers analyst Alan Rifkin said in a 
research note. "We remain very cautious as weakness continues."  Rifkin rates Pier 1 stock at "underweight."  Pier 1's total sales fell 10.9 percent to $242.5 million in 
December.  The Forth Worth, Texas-based company, which has posted 
seven consecutive quarterly losses, mailed catalogs to 15 
million customers and unveiled a magazine, Internet and e-mail 
advertising campaign as it looked to improve sales.  Pier 1 has also been modernizing its furniture offerings 
and selling a wider array of home fashions like curtains and 
glassware.  "Although early December sales trends, driven primarily by 
holiday-related items, were better than we had experienced in 
prior months, sales of our core home furnishing related items 
did not improve," Chief Executive Marvin Girouard said in a 
statement. He added that sales were mostly driven by promotions 
during the month.
