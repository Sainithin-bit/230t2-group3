 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - Belgian biotech company Innogenetics 
INNX.BR said on Thursday it would receive $7 million in 
damages after a U.S. court upheld a patent infringement verdict 
against Abbott Laboratories ( ABT.N ). 

  Innogenetics, which develops disease diagnosis and genetic 
testing as well as therapeutic vaccines, said the U.S. District 
Court judge for the Western District of Wisconisin affirmed the 
damages claim and rejected Abbott's request for a new trial.  The judge, who declined to award enhanced damages or 
attorneys fees, could have decided to increase the $7 million 
damages threefold.  Shares in Innogenetics opened up 0.1 percent on Euronext 
Brussels.  Innogenetics, which had accused Abbott of infringing its 
hepatitis C virus genotyping patent, cautioned in August that 
its second-half results could be affected by costs related to 
the patent suit and that it expected to book the damages as 
revenues although it was not clear when.
