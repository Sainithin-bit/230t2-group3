 CHICAGO  Jan 4 (Reuters) - Costco Wholesale Corp. ( COST.O )
on Thursday posted a better-than-expected 9 percent December
sales increase at stores open at least a year, helped by
strength in televisions, jewelry and apparel items.  The largest U.S. warehouse club operator, whose shares rose
about 2 percent in morning Nasdaq trading, said higher gasoline
prices also helped lift sales. The company has gas stations at
many of its U.S. stores.  Net sales for the five weeks ended Dec. 31, 2006, increased
14 percent to $7.24 billion from the same period the previous
year.  Ten analysts, on average, expected December same-store
sales to increase 5.6 percent, according to estimates gathered
by Reuters.  "Costco's December (same-store sales) were slightly better
than we expected and the company continues to outperform
competitors consistently and significantly," said Edward
Weller, an analyst with ThinkEquity Partners.  Weller noted that Costco's sales were particularly strong
in the U.S. Northeast, which is the stronghold of rival BJ's
Wholesale Club Inc. BJ.N, and in Texas, where Wal-Mart's
( WMT.N ) Sam's Club has a heavy concentration of stores.  "Costco's comps have exceeded Sam's Club's for 61 of the
last 63 months," he said.  Costco, currently operating 504 warehouses worldwide, said
the most recent year's five-week period included 34 days of
sales compared with 33 days the previous year, reflecting the
timing of the New Year's holiday.  The shift helped total company comparable sales rise by
about 3 percent, but will hurt sales by the same amount in
January, the company said.  For the five-week period, comparable U.S. sales rose 9
percent, while comparable international sales rose 10 percent.  The average price for gasoline was $2.29 a gallon in
December, up from $2.09 the year before. That increase
accounted for 0.75 percentage points of the same-store sales
increase, the company said.  Net sales for the first 18 weeks of its reporting period
ended Dec. 31 rose 10 percent to $22.23 billion. Costco's shares were up $1.02 at $53.86 on the Nasdaq. The
stock is up about 6 percent in the past year, compared with
Wal-Mart's 3 percent gain and a 10 percent increase for BJ's.
