 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Google Inc. ( GOOG.O ), the world's 
largest search engine, has bought a stake in China's Xunlei 
Network Technology Co, which provides file-sharing and other 
services, a Google spokesman said on Thursday. 

  Terms of the deal were not disclosed by Google, although 
the China Daily earlier reported that Xunlei planned to 
announce the details soon.  Google is reportedly partnering Ceyuan Ventures, a 
Shanghai-based venture capital firm for the investment, the 
newspaper said.  More than 80 million users have installed Shenzhen-based 
Xunlei's software and its Web sites attract more than 50 
million visitors a day, the China Daily said.  Baidu.com Inc. ( BIDU.O ) controlled nearly 57 percent of 
China's search-engine market at the end of June, according to 
Analysis International, a Beijing-based IT research company.  Sources have said both Baidu and Google, which has only 16 
percent of the China market, are exploring options to expand 
their online video services in the world's fourth-largest 
economy.  The moves come after Google closed its $1.65 billion 
acquisition of top online video-sharing site YouTube. Baidu 
also launched its own Chinese-language video Web channel on a 
trial basis a few months ago.
