 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co.'s U.S. sales in December exceeded the automaker's internal targets, Ford sales analyst George Pipas told reporters and analysts on Wednesday. 

 Retail sales were down 15 percent in December, while fleet sales declined 6 percent, Pipas said. The sales decline in December was attributed to lower sales of F-Series pickup as well as the discontinued Taurus and Freestar minivan, he said.
