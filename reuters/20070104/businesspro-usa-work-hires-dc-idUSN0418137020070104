 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Workers with New Year's resolutions to 
find new jobs may find their timing is good, as nearly half of 
employers plan to boost the salaries offered to new hires this 
year, said a survey released on Thursday. 

  One in five workers plans to change jobs this year, 
according to the survey released by CareerBuilder.com, an 
online job site.  One-third of workers surveyed said they were dissatisfied 
with their pay. One in four said they did not receive a raise 
last year and of those who did, one in five said the raise was 
2 percent or less.  A third said they were dissatisfied with the opportunities 
for advancement at their current jobs, 86 percent said they did 
not get a promotion last year and 26 percent said they felt 
overlooked.  Job seekers will have plenty of negotiating power because 
employers are facing a growing labor shortage, said Rosemary 
Haefner, vice president of human resources at CareerBuilder.  "Bigger paychecks and promises of career advancement and 
flexible schedules are expected to be offered on a wider scale 
this year," she said.  The survey said 49 percent of employers will raise the 
salaries offered to new hires this year.  Forty percent of employers say they have positions they 
have been unable to fill, CareerBuilder also said.  The survey was conducted online for CareerBuilder by Harris 
Interactive among 6,169 full-time U.S. workers and 2,627 hiring 
managers between November 17 and December 11. The margin of 
error was plus or minus 1 percentage point among the workers, 
and plus or minus 2 percentage points among the managers.  CareerBuilder.com is owned by Gannett Co. Inc. ( GCI.N ), the
