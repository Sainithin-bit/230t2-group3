 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - J.C. Penney Co Inc. ( JCP.N ) said on Thursday its December sales at department stores open at least a year rose 2.6 percent, driven by sales of children's clothing, jewelry and other gift items. 

 Analysts, on average, had been expecting a same-store sales increase of 2.6 percent, according to a Reuters survey. J.C. Penny itself had forecast a low-single-digit increase.
