 SAO PAULO, Brazil  (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co. ( F.N ) said on Thursday it will invest $1.02 billion in Brazil through 2011 and buy off-road vehicle maker Troller. 

 The U.S. automaker, which has been suffering financial woes, did not say how much it would pay for Troller. Based in the northeastern state of Ceara, Troller produces about 100 vehicles per month of two off-road models: the T4 and a pickup called the Pantanal. The company said in November that it was in talks to sell to Ford. Ford said the investments would be in addition to about $139 million it planned to spend on product development and capacity expansion at a plant in Sao Paulo state. Unlike in the United States, where Ford has suffered from slower sales, it has regained market share in Brazil in recent years thanks to a group of new small cars designed in Latin America's largest country and aimed at buyers in the developing world.
