 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A gauge of U.S. online job demand fell 
as expected in December, in line with a seasonal slowdown in 
hiring, online careers and recruiting firm Monster said on 
Thursday. 

  Monster said its Employment Index fell 8 points to 167, 
down from 175 in November. It was 145 a year ago, reflecting a 
15 percent increase for 2006.  "The indications are that job growth will continue to 
moderate in the beginning of 2007 but still be relatively 
healthy," said Steve Pogorzelski, group president of Monster 
Worldwide ( MNST.O ), parent company of Monster. "We see 
unemployment rates continuing to remain at historically low 
levels."  "Acute skills shortages in certain occupational categories 
will continue to worsen and our employer customers are still 
very concerned with employee turnover driven by higher wages," 
Pogorzelski added.  The hiring decline was partly offset by a slight rebound in 
recruitment in the real estate, rental and leasing industry, 
mirroring other indicators that the housing market's slide 
might be bottoming out.  "It is one month's worth of data that we will continue to 
track very closely," Pogorzelski said. "It is a very good sign 
taken with some of the others relating to the housing market 
but it is too soon to draw any type of conclusion."  Overall, 13 of the 20 industries and 21 of the 23 
occupational categories tracked by the Monster index decreased 
their online recruitment activity in December.  In a separate report, the Conference Board said on 
Wednesday its measure of the total number of unduplicated 
online jobs dropped 10 percent to 3.34 million in December from 
about 3.71 million in November.  The Monster Employment index is a monthly analysis based on 
a review of more than 1,500 career sites, job boards and other 
Web sites. The margin of error is plus or minus 1 percent.  This employment index comes before the government's monthly 
labor market report on Friday, which is expected to show the 
U.S. economy added 100,000 new jobs in December, down from 
132,000 in November, according to a Reuters survey.
