 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Growth in the U.S. services sector slowed as expected in December and new factory orders rose at a disappointing pace the previous month, reports showed on Thursday, pointing to a slackening economy. 

 Analysts said while the reports painted a picture of an economy treading water, the Federal Reserve was likely to hold interest rates unchanged in the early part of 2007, monitoring the cooling housing market to see if it has a broader-than-expected impact on growth. The Fed minutes of the December meeting released on Wednesday said some members had noted that the "subdued tone" of recent economic data meant risks to growth had increased. "Economic growth slowed over the course of 2006 and is expected to grow slightly below its long-term trend in 2007. The fallout from the housing sector continues to remain the wildcard for the overall economy," said Sam Bullard, economist at Wachovia in Charlotte, North Carolina. The Institute for Supply Management said its services index dipped to 57.1 in December from 58.9 in November. This was broadly in line with market expectations for a 57.0 reading. A number above 50 indicates growth in the sector. The services sector makes up about 80 percent of U.S. economy activity, including businesses such as restaurants, hotels, hair salons, banks and airlines. "It's not pointing to the re-acceleration that some are expecting out there. This fits with the story of moderate growth. The Fed will see this consistent with its policy on hold," said Keith Hembre, chief economist at FAF Advisors in Minneapolis. FIRST RATE CUT SEEN DELAYED Government bond prices extended their gains on the ISM report. The dollar advanced further, still drawing strength from recent data showing a resilient economy and perceptions that the Fed would delay its first rate cut. The central bank raised its target for the federal funds rate 17 times, to 5.25 percent, between June 2004 and June 2006. Analysts expect it to start easing monetary policy sometime this year. The next policy-setting meeting for the Fed is scheduled for the end of the month. Supporting the view of a slowing economy was news that factory orders rose 0.9 percent in November, below the market's consensus outlook for a 1.4 percent gain. In October, new orders declined by a revised 4.5 percent, the Commerce Department said, versus a previous estimate of 4.7 percent. Excluding transportation, November factory orders fell 0.5 percent. Orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, seen as a good gauge of business spending, fell 1.1 percent, following a 4.0 percent fall the previous month. The last time this measure fell for two consecutive months was in February and March 2005. "The economy is running at a sub-trend pace and this is consistent with real GDP being on the weak side of its 3 percent potential rate," said Chris Rupkey, vice president and senior financial economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi in New York. Consumers also appear to be showing signs of fatigue. Retailers posted disappointing December sales, marking the third consecutive month of disappointing growth, according to research firm Retail Metrics. It said 10 retailers lowered their earnings forecasts. HOUSING STABILIZING? However, housing and jobless claims data released on Thursday painted a slightly different picture. The National Association of Realtors said its Pending Home Sales Index, based on contracts signed in November, fell to 107.0 from 107.5 in October, but held above July's trough. The index had been forecast at 108.0. "The index is pointing toward fairly stable home sales in the near future," David Lereah, chief economist for the trade association, said in a statement. "That is another indicator that home sales likely bottomed-out in September." The number of workers applying for initial jobless benefits edged up 10,000 to 329,000 in the week ended December 30, beating market expectations. But analysts said the figure had been distorted by the holidays and the job market remained stable. The prior week's jobless claims number was revised up to 319,000 from a preliminary 317,000. Wall Street economists had forecast, on average, that claims in the December 30 week would be a seasonally adjusted 318,000. "We always get a lot of volatility with this series during the holidays. I'm not going to take this number too seriously. Tomorrow's (December payrolls) number is the key," said David Wyss, chief economist at Standard & Poor's Ratings Services in New York. Backing the view of a stable labor market was an independent report showing that planned layoffs fell 29 percent in December from the previous month. Planned job cuts for all of 2006 fell below 1 million for the first time since 2000, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas Inc., an employment consulting firm. Nonfarm payrolls data for December due on Friday will give a clearer picture of the labor market. A Reuters poll of economists taken on Wednesday forecast 100,000 jobs added to the payrolls, below the 132,000 gain in November. The unemployment rate seen remaining unchanged at 4.5 percent.
