 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Boeing Co. ( BA.N ) said on Thursday it 
had taken firm orders for 1,044 commercial aircraft in 2006, 
topping its previous record and probably beating European rival 
Airbus for the first time since 2000. 

  The U.S. planemaker benefited from strong demand by 
European, Middle Eastern and Asian airlines, confounding 
analysts who had expected a slowdown in sales from 2005. Boeing 
was also helped by the outstanding success of its new 
lightweight 787 Dreamliner, which is set to enter service next 
year.  Airbus, distracted by production and management problems, 
has badly lagged Boeing for the past 12 months, notching only 
635 orders by the end of November. That company, controlled by 
EADS ( EAD.PA ), plans to report its 2006 orders later this 
month.  Boeing's annual order tally, worth about $114 billion at 
list prices, is the company's best ever, topping the previous 
record of 1,002 aircraft in 2006, but still short of Airbus' 
industry record of 1,055 net orders in 2005.  The U.S. planemaker still lags Airbus in terms of 
deliveries, with 398 commercial planes flown to customers in 
2006. At the end of November, Airbus had already delivered 399 
planes.
  DREAMLINER DOMINATES  Boeing reported a record 729 orders for its single-aisle 
737, the workhorse for many regional, domestic and low-cost 
airlines, up from 569 the previous year. Airbus had 580 orders 
for its family of single-aisle planes at the end of November.  U.S. low-cost carrier Southwest Airlines ( LUV.N ) was the 
biggest buyer of single-aisle jets, ordering 82 737-700s worth 
about $4.8 billion at list prices. Germany's Air Berlin 
( AB1.DE ) ordered 75 737s, mostly of the larger 737-800 model, 
worth about $5 billion overall.  Boeing took orders for 315 of its more lucrative widebody 
planes, led by its market-dominating 787. That number looks set 
to crush Airbus, which struggled with the design of its 
mid-sized A350 and production gaffes on its flagship A380 
superjumbo. At the end of November, it had only 55 widebody 
orders for the year on its books.  The market for larger planes was ruled by the 
carbon-and-titanium 787, Boeing's most successful launch, with 
157 orders in 2006. The aircraft, which promises a more 
comfortable ride for passengers and better fuel economy for its 
operators, is set for its first test flight this summer.  Australian airline Qantas ( QAN.AX ) made the year's largest 
order, for 45 787s, worth about $8 billion at list prices. 
Singapore Airlines ( SIAL.SI ) also ordered 20 787s, worth about 
$3.7 billion.  Boeing booked 76 orders for its larger 777 widebody and 72 
for the 747 jumbo, which was revamped last year. Boeing's 767 
jet, which is getting close to the end of its production life, 
took 10 orders.  State-owned Qatar Airways was the biggest buyer of 777s, 
ordering a mix of 22 long range, extended range and freighter 
versions of the jet, worth about $5.4 billion overall.  Germany's Lufthansa ( LHAG.DE ) made the biggest jumbo order, 
buying 20 of the new 747-8 passenger jet, the largest in 
Boeing's range, worth about $5.5 billion overall.  Eighty-one of Boeing's orders were for freighter aircraft, 
worth about $21 billion, or 18 percent of the total by value.  Boeing's tally of 398 deliveries is a 37 percent jump from 
2005's figure of 290. It came in just ahead of Boeing's own 
forecast of 395 deliveries. Boeing is expecting 440 to 445 
deliveries this year.
  RECOVERY MILESTONE  The new orders record marks a further milestone in Boeing's 
turnaround after a series of corporate scandals and production 
blunders.  During the last upturn in commercial plane sales in the 
late 1990s, Boeing disastrously miscalculated its manufacturing 
ramp-up, causing a production line to shut down for several 
months, leaving customers waiting for planes.  Since then Boeing's defense unit became embroiled in two 
procurement scandals, one relating to the appropriation of a 
rival's rocket designs and another for improperly hiring an 
ex-Air Force weapons buyer. It finally settled those matters 
with the U.S. government with a $615 million payment last 
summer.  The Air Force recruitment scandal led to the resignation of 
Boeing Chief Executive Phil Condit in December 2003. His 
successor, Harry Stonecipher, was ousted in 2005 after an 
affair with a female Boeing executive.  Boeing's current CEO, James McNerney, has steadied the 
company since he took over in June 2005, but it still suffered 
a shock last September when the CEO of its commercial planes 
unit, Alan Mulally, left to head Ford Motor Co. ( F.N )  Boeing shares closed up 36 cents at $89.53 on the New York 
Stock Exchange, a little short of their all-time high of 
$92.03, reached in November.
