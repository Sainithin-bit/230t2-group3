 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Pier 1 Imports Inc. ( PIR.N ) said on 
Thursday that December sales fell 10.7 percent at stores open 
at least a year, dragged down by sluggish demand for its core 
home furnishings. 

  Analysts on average expected the struggling home decor 
retailer to post a same-store sales decline of 11 percent, 
according to a Reuters poll.  December marks Pier 1's 11th straight month of declining 
same-store sales.  Total sales fell 10.9 percent to $242.5 million.  The sales decline came despite an aggressive marketing 
campaign and revamped merchandise offerings aimed at boosting 
store traffic for the holiday season.  "Although early December sales trends, driven primarily by 
holiday-related items, were better than we had experienced in 
prior months, sales of our core home furnishing related items 
did not improve," Chief Executive Marvin Girouard said in a 
statement. He added that sales were mostly driven by promotions 
during the month.
