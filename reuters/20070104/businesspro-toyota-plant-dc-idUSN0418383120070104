 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp. ( 7203.T ) said on 
Thursday it is considering expanding its manufacturing capacity 
in North America and is reviewing locations. 

  "We are looking at sites," spokesman Dan Sieger said, but 
declined to reveal details.  Toyota, which saw U.S. sales rise 13 percent in the 
industry's largest market, will have the annual capacity to 
build about 2 million cars and trucks by 2008 in 15 plants 
across North America.  The Japanese automaker is rapidly gaining U.S. market 
share, outpacing DaimlerChrysler AG DCXGn.D in 2006 to grab 
the No. 3 spot.  The Wall Street Journal, citing people familiar with the 
matter, reported on Thursday that Toyota may name a site in the 
southern United States for its eighth North American assembly 
plant as early as this month.  Toyota is considering three-to-five locations, including 
Chattanooga, Tennessee, and Marion, Arkansas, the Journal said. 
Other sources told the paper that a location near Alamo, 
Tennessee and in North Carolina also are possibilities.  The new plant would have annual manufacturing capacity of 
200,000 vehicles and start production in 2009, sources told the 
Journal.
