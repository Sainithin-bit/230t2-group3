 BOSTON/NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Eli Lilly and Co. ( LLY.N ) said on Thursday it has agreed to settle the majority of cases brought against the company by patients claiming its antipsychotic drug Zyprexa caused them to develop diabetes. 

 Lilly said it will take a charge of up to $500 million in the fourth quarter to cover more than 18,000 claims -- substantially less than the $700 million it agreed to pay to settle about 8,000 claims in June 2005. Revenue from Zyprexa, Lilly's biggest product, fell sharply in 2005 due to concerns over the drug's tendency to cause weight gain -- a major risk factor for development of diabetes. Although sales have since stabilized, the 11-year-old drug has a much-reduced market share. The agreement removes a weight from Lilly's back at a time it is struggling to develop new drugs, particularly its experimental blood-thinner prasugrel, a potential blockbuster that is critical to Lilly's future growth. "While we remain confident that these claims are without merit, we took this difficult step because we believe it is in the best interest of the company, the patients who depend on this medication, and their physicians," Lilly Chief Executive Officer Sidney Taurel said. Still, the Zyprexa issue isn't over. About 1,200 claims are not included in the settlements and will go to trial, beginning in April, in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York. "Lilly believes this largely resolves the issue, though we are less sure," said Steve Scala, an analyst at Cowen and Co. "This is still a lingering issue for them, and while it doesn't compare in scale to whether prasugrel works, it is something investors should be tracking." Bank of America analyst Chris Schott said Lilly has a "high probability" of success against remaining plaintiffs. Moreover, he said he does not expect a dramatic number of new lawsuits to be filed against Lilly because the statute of limitations has lapsed. "Most of the commercial impact from Zyprexa's side-effect profile has already occurred," said Schott, noting that use of Zyprexa now appears to be concentrated among severe psychiatric patients where the drug's benefits outweigh its risks. JP Morgan analyst Chris Shibutani on Wednesday said U.S. sales of Zyprexa, which fell 16 percent in 2005, should remain little changed until the drug's U.S. patent lapses in 2011 and it faces competition from cheaper generics. The latest settlements will result in the dismissal of claims against health-care professionals named as co-defendants in the Zyprexa cases. Most of the plaintiffs' claims stated that before September 2003, the package insert warning of a potential link between Zyprexa and elevated blood sugar or diabetes was not sufficiently clear. In September 2003, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration required makers of atypical antipsychotics such as Zyprexa to add more information to their package inserts related to diabetes. The New York Times last month said internal Lilly documents indicated Lilly for years has kept important information from doctors about Zyprexa's links to obesity and elevated blood sugar. Lilly's own published data, which it told sales representatives to play down in conversations with doctors, showed 30 percent of patients taking Zyprexa gain 22 pounds or more after a year on the drug, with some reporting gains of 100 pounds or more, the Times said in its front-page article. Lilly, reacting to the Times story, said it was based on "selective documents illegally leaked" by plaintiffs' lawyers. While nearly all of the newer class of atypical antipsychotic are associated with weight gain, many psychiatrists consider Zyprexa to be the worst offender, although it was also shown in a recent federally funded trial to be one of the most effective in treating schizophrenia. Shares of Lilly were up 10 cents to $52.35 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
