 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - News Corp.'s Fox Filmed Entertainment studio said on Wednesday it grossed $3.56 billion in box office receipts in 2006, helped by hits such as "Borat," "Ice Age: The Meltdown" and "X-Men: The Last Stand." 

 The company said its global box office total was an industry record. Los Angeles-based Fox said it took in more than $644 million in worldwide ticket sales from the animated feature "Ice Age: The Meltdown." It raked in $456 million from "X-Men: The Last Stand," the final chapter of the studio's "X-Men" trilogy. The hit comedy "Borat: Cultural Learnings to Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," has taken in more than $240 million so far. The spoof features prankster Sacha Baron Cohen as a Kazakh journalist filming a documentary on American life. Other Fox hits included "Eragon," which grossed over $170 million so far, and "Night at the Museum," featuring Ben Stiller, which has taken in more than $127 million to date in domestic box office revenue.
