 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Three major U.S. roasters this week 
hiked prices on well-known roast and ground coffee brands, 
including Maxwell House and Folgers, citing a steady rise in 
green arabica bean prices. 

  Procter & Gamble ( PG.N ), the largest U.S. roaster, set the 
trend on Wednesday when it raised its suggested retail price 
for Folgers roast and ground coffee by 4 percent, or up 10 
cents per 11.5-ounce (326-gram) and 13-ounce equivalent 
small-sized canister.  The company also increased its Folgers gourmet selections 
by 20 cents per 11.5-ounce equivalent, a 5 percent increase, 
with the increases effective immediately.  "This price move is reflecting the sustained green coffee 
price increase for arabica beans on the New York arabica 'C' 
market," P&G spokesman Lars Atorf had said.  Arabica coffee futures contracts are traded on the New York 
Board of Trade, and the "C" market, also called the "C" 
contract, is the spot month contract.  Spot-month March coffee contract KCH7 closed up 1.40 
cents per pound to $1.2500 on Thursday, with roasters buying on 
the session's lows following P&G's price hike announced the 
previous day.  Since September 18, 2006, the settling price for NYBOT's 
coffee spot month has increased 25 percent from $0.9920 per 
pound to $1.2500 on December 28, near an 18-month high dating 
back to April 29, 2005, when it closed at $1.2515 per ton.  Brazil is the world's largest coffee producer and is 
expected to produce a significantly smaller crop in 2007/08 
compared to 2006/07, creating concerns of tight supplies.  Massimo Zanetti Beverage USA, the U.S. unit of the 
privately held Italian company Massimo Zanetti Beverage Group, 
raised the list prices it charges retailers for many of its 
coffee brands early on Thursday morning.  The price increase was effective immediately, and included 
a 10 cent hike on 10.5- to 13-ounce equivalent cans of Hills 
Brothers, Chock full o'Nuts, MJB and Chase & Sanborn, company 
spokesman Brian Kubicki said.  Zanetti also boosted the list price of the 12-ounce 
equivalent bag of premium coffee Chock full o'Nuts New York 
Classics by 20 cents.  Later in the afternoon, Kraft Foods Inc. KFT.N, the 
largest packaged food company in North America, announced its 
list price increase on some of its Maxwell House and Yuban 
coffees, also immediately in effect.  Kraft raised the cost of 11- to 13-ounce cans of Maxwell 
House and Yuban coffees by 10 cents, a Kraft spokesperson said.  This brings the list or suggested retail price for a 
13-ounce can of Maxwell House coffee to $2.66 from $2.56.  None of the companies increased the price for instant 
coffee.  All three companies lifted prices on various coffee brands 
in October 2006, citing gains of 70 percent in green robusta 
prices over the last year. Robusta beans are typically used to 
make instant coffee or are blended with ground arabica beans to 
make a more affordable brewed coffee.
