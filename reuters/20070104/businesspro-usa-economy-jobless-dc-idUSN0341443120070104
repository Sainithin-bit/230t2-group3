 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The number of workers applying for 
initial jobless benefits exceeded market expectations by edging 
up 10,000 to 329,000 in the week ended December 30, according 
to a Labor Department report on Thursday that showed a stable 
job market. 

  The prior week's jobless claims number was revised up to 
319,000 from the preliminary 317,000. Wall Street economists 
had forecast, on average, that claims in the December 30 week 
would be a seasonally adjusted 318,000.  "We always get a lot of volatility with this series during 
the holidays. I'm not going to take this number too seriously. 
Tomorrow's number (payroll reading) is the key," said David 
Wyss, chief economist at Standard & Poor's Ratings Services in 
New York.  "The claims are up a little bit, but continued claims are 
down a lot. This is a wash. But the continued claims have more 
to do with the unemployment rate," Wyss added.  There was little market reaction to the jobless claims 
data.  Nonfarm payrolls data for December are due to be issued on 
Friday. A Reuters poll of economists taken on Wednesday called 
for 100,000 jobs to be added and the unemployment rate to 
remain unchanged at 4.5 percent.  Some traders, however, thought the number of new jobs 
created would be smaller after a private report issued on 
Wednesday showed private sector employment falling in December.  Some Federal Reserve Board officials have said that the 
"subdued tone" of recent economic data means the risk to U.S. 
economic growth had grown, according to minutes issued on 
Wednesday.  The four-week moving average of claims, considered a more 
reliable indicator because it irons out temporary fluctuations, 
rose to 317,500 in the week ended December 30, from 316,250 in 
the prior week.  The number of people filing for continuing claims fell to 
2.45 million in the week ended December 23 -- the most recent 
week these data were available -- from 2.52 million the prior 
week.  Thirty nine states reported increases in unadjusted initial 
claims in the week ended December 23, attributing the rise to 
the transportation, construction and automotive sectors in many 
cases, the Labor Department said.  (Additional reporting by  Richard Leong  in New York)
