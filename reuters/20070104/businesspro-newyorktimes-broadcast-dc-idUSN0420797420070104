 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The New York Times Co. ( NYT.N ) said on 
Thursday it sold its broadcast group, including nine television 
stations, for $575 million to private equity firm Oak Hill 
Capital Partners in order to concentrate on its newspaper 
business. 

  The deal is expected to close in the first half of this 
year, and includes affiliates of the ABC, NBC and CBS networks 
in Iowa, Arkansas, Alabama, Tennessee, Illinois, Virginia, 
Pennsylvania and two in Oklahoma.  New York Times Co. Chief Executive Janet Robinson said in a 
statement that the sale would allow the media company to focus 
on the "development of our newspapers and our rapidly growing 
digital businesses."  New York Times Co., like other newspaper publishers, has 
struggled with depressed newspaper advertising and circulation, 
and has sought to cut costs while building its Internet 
business. It had previously disclosed plans to complete the 
sale of its broadcast media group in the first half of 2007.  New York Times Co. said late last year that revenues from 
its Internet-related businesses, including About.com and 
NYTimes.com, could grow by 30 percent in 2007, making it a 
bright spot for the company.  Shares of the New York Times closed down 39 cents, or 1.6 
percent, to $23.34 on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday.
