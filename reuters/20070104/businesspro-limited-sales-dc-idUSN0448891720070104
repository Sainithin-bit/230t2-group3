 ATLANTA  (Reuters) - Apparel retailer Limited Brands Inc. 
( LTD.N ) said on Thursday its sales at stores open at least a 
year rose 4 percent in December, below company and Wall Street 
expectations, on lower traffic. 

  The company's shares fell 6.8 percent in early trading.  Analysts, on average, had expected a same-store sales gain 
of 9.3 percent for the five-week period ended December 30, 
according to a Reuters survey.  On a recorded call, the company said same-store results 
fell short of its estimates of a high-single-digit rise as 
sales missed expectations at Victoria's Secret and in its 
apparel group.  The company said momentum from November did not stretch 
into December, noting that mall traffic and same-store sales 
were strongest in the last week of the month when customers 
were shopping for clearance items.  Total sales for the company, whose store chains include 
Victoria's Secret, Express and Bath & Body Works, rose 6 
percent to $2.03 billion.  Same-store sales were up 10 percent at Victoria's Secret 
and Victoria's Secret Direct and rose 5 percent at Bath & Body 
Works. But those sales fell 10 percent at Limited stores and 5 
percent at Express stores.  The company said it expects comparable January store sales 
to rise in the high single digits.  Limited Brands shares were off $2.02 at $27.56 in early 
trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
