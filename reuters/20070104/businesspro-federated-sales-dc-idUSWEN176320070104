 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Federated Department Stores Inc. 
FD.N on Thursday posted a weaker-than-expected rise in 
December sales at stores open at least one fiscal year and said 
it expects fourth-quarter sales will be at the low end of its 
forecast. 

  Federated, the parent of Macy's and Bloomingdale's, 
acquired May Department Stores last year and has struggled with 
disappointing sales at the hundreds of former May stores it 
converted in September to the Macy's nameplate.  Federated said its December sales were weaker-than-expected 
in the face of unseasonably warm weather. It was the warmest 
December in at least 10 years, according to weather tracking 
firm Planalytics.  Federated reported a 4.4 percent rise in December sales at 
stores open at least one full fiscal year, while analysts, on 
average, had been expecting a rise of 5.3 percent, according to 
a Reuters survey. Federated had forecast a gain of 5 percent to 
8 percent.  Cincinnati, Ohio-based Federated said total sales for the 
five weeks ended December 30 fell 8.5 percent to $5 billion.  Total sales declined due to the closing of 78 so-called 
duplicative store locations over the past year.  It said performance in former May Company stores improved 
in December compared with October and November, but home 
merchandise remained weak in the former May stores.  Federated forecast same-store sales in January to increase 
by 1.5 to 3 percent. Same-store sales for the fourth quarter 
are expected to rise by approximately 5 percent, it said.  It also said it expects fourth-quarter sales to come in at 
the low end of its previously announced range of $9.1 billion 
to $9.4 billion.
