 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Marvell Technology Group Ltd. 
( MRVL.O ) said on Thursday that a company investigation of its 
stock option accounting practices had found that incorrect 
dates were used on some grants. 

  Marvell said that Chief Executive Sehat Sutardja and Chief 
Financial Officer George Hervey were among those executives who 
received backdated option grants, and that they had agreed to 
change the terms of the grants to reflect the actual dates they 
were issued.
