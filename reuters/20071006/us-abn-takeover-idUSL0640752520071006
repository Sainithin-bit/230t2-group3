 LONDON  (Reuters) - Investors representing 85 percent of shares in ABN AMRO have accepted a 70-billion-euro ($99 billion) bid for the Dutch bank from a consortium led by Royal Bank of Scotland, the Financial Times said. 

 The newspaper, without naming sources, said on Saturday the level of acceptances meant the consortium, which also includes Spain's Santander and Belgian-Dutch group Fortis, could declare its offer unconditional this week. Royal Bank of Scotland declined to comment. The consortium is expected to announce the outcome of the ABN shareholder vote early next week. On Friday, British bank Barclays withdrew its lower offer for ABN AMRO after receiving support from shareholders owning just 0.2 percent of the Dutch bank's ordinary shares.
