 LONDON  (Reuters) - Richard Branson, the bilionaire boss who was heading Virgin Group's failed attempt to rescue Northern Rock NRK.L, said he was "very disappointed" at the government's decision on Sunday to nationalize the ailing bank. 

 British Finance Minister Alistair Darling said Northern Rock would be temporarily nationalized as two private sector offers, including the one from a Virgin-led consortium, would not deliver sufficient value for money for the taxpayer. Branson said in an e-mailed statement: "We were very clear the business plan we put forward was robust, conservative, but ultimately capable of rescuing the interests of all stakeholders. However, we must accept the decision with good grace." (Reporting by  Steve Slater , editing by Maureen Bavdek)
