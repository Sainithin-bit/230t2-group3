 (Reuters) - The UK government announced the temporary nationalization of troubled British bank Northern Rock NRK.L on Sunday, rejecting two rival bids to take it over. 

 Following is a list of some previous nationalizations or bailouts by the British government: * ROLLS-ROYCE PLC ( RR.L ) In 1971 Rolls-Royce was rescued by the British government from bankruptcy following the mounting cost of developing its RB211 turbofan aeroengine. Under the rescue deal, the car business was split from the aeroengine side which was nationalized. Rolls-Royce cars is now owned by Germany's BMW AG ( BMWG.DE ) while the aeroengine part returned to the stock market. * BRITISH LEYLAND: In 1968 a merger created the vast carmaker with 70 factories and some 200,000 workers which suffered severe industrial militancy. By the mid 1970s it had to be saved from bankruptcy by the Labor government. Under the Conservatives in the 1980s new management was installed and its name was changed to BL, then Austin Rover, then just Rover, as buses, trucks and parts divisions were sold and the workforce slashed. Subsequently renamed MG Rover the group ran out of cash in April 2005 and cut up to 5,000 jobs after failing to secure a rescue deal with China's Shanghai Automotive Industry Corp. The government loaned Rover about 6.5 million pounds as part of a rescue plan. The company was later sold to Nanjing Automobile Group for an unknown sum. * JOHNSON MATTHEY BANK, NATIONAL HOME LOANS: In 1984 the Bank of England rescued Johnson Matthey Bank, buying it for one pound and putting in its own managers to run it. National Home Loans hit trouble in 1991 after a fall in UK property prices, plus closure of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI) which hit liquidity at its National Mortgage Bank subsidiary. A Bank of England-backed lifeboat rescued NHL from collapse and from 1992 new chairman Jonathan Perry oversaw a turnaround in the company's fortunes. * RAILTRACK: Railtrack was put into administration -- a form of creditor protection -- in 2001 after the government lost faith with management and stopped subsidizing the company. Unlike Railtrack, new owner Network Rail does not have any shareholders and retains all its profits in the business. Network Rail took over the running of Britain's 23,000 miles of track and 2,500 stations in October 2002. * BRITISH ENERGY BGY.L British Energy ran into trouble in 2002 as power prices fell below its costs of production. Rescued from insolvency, Britain extended an emergency aid package totaling 650 million pounds ($1 billion) in September 2002 to the loss-making privatized energy provider. In October 2003 the company's creditors signed a restructuring deal that handed them control of the stricken nuclear power producer in exchange for forgiving more than half its 1.3 billion pounds ($2.2 billion) of debts. * NORTHERN ROCK Britain's Bank of England bailed out the mortgage lender in September 2007, promising emergency funds after the global credit crunch hit its ability to raise cash in money markets.
