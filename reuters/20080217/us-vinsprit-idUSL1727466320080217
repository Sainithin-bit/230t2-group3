 STOCKHOLM  (Reuters) - Sweden's centre-right government has chosen four bidders in its auction of Vin & Sprit that will be allowed to perform due diligence of the Absolut vodka maker, business daily Dagens Industri reported on Sunday. 

 The four selected bidders -- Fortune Brands Inc FO.N, Pernod Ricard SA ( PERP.PA ), Bacardi and private equity group EQT in cooperation with investment firm Investor AB ( INVEb.ST ) -- have been widely seen as the front-runners to buy Vin & Sprit. The newspaper, which did not disclose its sources, said the four bidders would proceed to more closely scrutinize Vin & Sprit in a due diligence process before finalizing their offers. Vin & Sprit is to be sold as part of Sweden's biggest-ever privatization, which also includes stakes in telecom operator TeliaSonera AB ( TLSN.ST ), Nordea Bank AB ( NDA.ST ), mortgage lender SBAB SBAB.UL and real estate firm Vasakronan ABVASA.UL. The government this week sold its entire holding of just under 7 percent of shares in bourse operator OMX AB OMX.ST which is set to be acquired by Borse Dubai as part of a broader agreement with U.S. exchange operator Nasdaq Stock Market Inc  ( NDAQ.O ).
