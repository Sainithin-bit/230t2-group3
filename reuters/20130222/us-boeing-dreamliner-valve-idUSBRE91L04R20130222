 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japan's transport ministry said on Friday its fuel leak probe on a Boeing Co ( BA.N ) 787 Dreamliner passenger jet indicated the cause to be a coating around the mechanism that controls fuel movement between tanks. 
 The ministry launched the investigation after two fuel leaks on a Dreamliner operated by Japan Airlines Co Ltd ( 9201.T ), just days before authorities around the world grounded the new lightweight passenger jets after a couple of battery problems.
