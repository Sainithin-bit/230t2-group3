 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - World stocks slipped and the dollar rebounded on Wednesday as disappointing data on the U.S. housing market investors raised worries about global growth, driving investors to less risky assets. 

 The yen and the U.S. dollar edged higher as traders flocked to the two traditional safe-havens and reduced exposure to currencies perceived as riskier. Oil fell below $78 a barrel after a surprise build in U.S. gasoline stocks increased doubts over demand from the world's largest fuel consumer. European shares slid to their lowest close in three weeks, led by sharp falls in banking shares after Banco Santander reported a 2.8 percent fall in net profit. The U.S. housing data also dragged on European equities and drove Wall Street lower, with the Nasdaq falling more than 2 percent. The U.S. government reported sales of new homes in September unexpectedly tumbled. The data added to concerns that major stock indexes had rallied too far given a still-soft economic outlook. "The (housing) number was surprisingly weak. I think that is going to add to the trend that we've seen recently where investors are questioning the robust pace of economic recovery going forward," said Joe Manimbo, currency trader at Travelex Global Business Payments in Washington. "That has benefited the dollar and helped to revive its safe-haven appeal." The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  fell 67.56 points, or 0.68 percent, to 9,814.61. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  lost 14.57 points, or 1.37 percent, to 1,048.84. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  gave up 43.24 points, or 2.04 percent, at 2,072.85. Among U.S. financial shares, JPMorgan Chase & Co ( JPM.N ) fell 2.7 percent to $42.73 and Bank of America Corp ( BAC.N ) lost 2.4 percent, to $15.07. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index  .FTEU3  closed down 1.8 percent to 981.65 points, its lowest close since October 5. Banco Santander ( SAN.MC ) declined 3.9 percent. Ireland's two main banks, Allied Irish Banks ALBKI.I and Bank of Ireland ( BKIR.I ) plunged 11.9 percent and 25 percent, respectively, on uncertainty over Dublin's bank rescue measures. The MSCI's all-country world stocks index .MIWD00000PUS shed 1.58 percent to 284.93. Japan's Nikkei  .N225  declined 1.35 percent to 10,075.05. "The market has taken off its rose-colored glasses," said Heinz-Gerd Sonnenschein, an equity strategist at Postbank. In foreign exchange, the yen and U.S. dollar gained with the softened outlooks on global growth and on weaker stocks. The dollar rose 0.25 percent versus a basket of major currencies .DXY. The euro fell 0.34 percent to $1.4758, while against the yen the dollar declined 0.77 percent to 91.08 yen. The yen and dollar were boosted as investors shunned the Australian dollar, which fell after Australian inflation data suggested the country's central bank was unlikely to tighten interest rates sharply. Euro zone government bonds and U.S. Treasuries gained traction on a safety bid on the back of the U.S. new home sales report and falling equities. Price gains for the benchmark 10-year Treasury note pushed its yield down 0.04 percentage point to 3.41 percent. Strong demand for a U.S. Treasury debt auction on Tuesday allayed concerns about the cumulative impact of $123 billion in U.S. government bond sales this week. "With the global tone of equity markets weakening we think a bullish fixed income correction is becoming increasingly likely," analysts at Societe Generale said in a client note. Oil fell $1.69 per barrel to $77.86, after a U.S. inventory report showed a surprise increase in gasoline stocks, giving credence to the broader theme of a sluggish rebound for the world's largest fuel consumer.
