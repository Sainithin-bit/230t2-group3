 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - New orders for long-lasting U.S. manufactured goods fell more sharply than expected in June, notching their biggest decline in five months as demand for communications and transportation equipment slumped, a government report showed on Wednesday. 

 KEY POINTS: * The Commerce Department said durable goods orders fell 2.5 percent, the largest drop since January, after rising by a revised 1.3 percent in May, previously reported as a 1.8 percent surge. * This was worse than market expectations for a 0.6 percent decline. Orders had advanced for two straight months. * New orders excluding transportation unexpectedly rose 1.1 percent in June, after climbing by 0.8 percent in May. Excluding defense, orders slipped 0.7 percent in June, after two months of straight gains. * Analysts polled by Reuters had expected orders excluding transportation to be flat. COMMENTS: MICHAEL MORAN, CHIEF ECONOMIST, DAIWA SECURITIES AMERICA, NEW YORK: "It was not a good report, but not as bad as it might appear on the surface. Most of the softness was in orders for commercial aircraft which probably reflected normal month to month volatility. "If you look outside the transportation category, the increase of 1.1 percent in orders was a reasonably good showing. You could make the case that we are starting to see a bottom form. Non-defense capital goods orders excluding aircraft were up. While not a strong performance, it is a sign of some stability in business spending." MARC CHANDLER, CHIEF GLOBAL CURRENCY STRATEGIST, BROWN BROTHERS HARRIMAN, NEW YORK: "Headline number was weaker than expected, but the ex-transportation rose more than expected. Most of the headline weakness can be traced to the collapse in airline bookings, which are down 39 percent. The auto sector also got hit a little bit, and that was partly because of the closures of GM and Chrysler in the first part of the month. What I thought was important were orders were up 1.4 percent, but I'm looking at the shipment of those goods which people use for estimating GDP. That posted its first gain this year. In the recent past the dollar has done better with bad economic news and a weaker stock market, for various reasons as good news has taken place equities have gone up and the dollar has suffered. But so far today that hasn't taken place." BULENT BAYGUN, HEAD OF U.S. INTEREST RATE STRATEGY, BNP PARIBAS, NEW YORK: "The fact that it was significantly lower than expectations is a testament to the fact that we are not out of the woods yet. Any optimism that we saw based on the house price data yesterday and concerns about rising rates because of weaker-than-expected (debt) auctions, I think are going to turn out to be very short lived." CHRIS RUPKEY, CHIEF FINANCIAL ECONOMIST, BANK OF TOKYO/MITSUBISHI UFJ, NEW YORK: "Durable goods orders were held down by a real drop in transportation orders, but looking through that there is a glimmer of hope that business capital spending is on the mend. Ex-aircraft, non-defense capital goods orders and shipments rose a bit in June. It looks like the worst point of the recession for business capital spending is behind us. It may be a slow recovery, but it looks more like recovery is here." SEBASTIEN GALY, SENIOR CURRENCY STRATEGIST, BNP PARIBAS, NEW YORK: "Durable goods doesn't look positive, but ex-transportation, it was not too bad. So the view is that while things are still weak, this release was not too bad. But it's no turning point in terms of momentum, and markets have reacted neither positively or negatively. You see some signs of strength in the U.S. that are encouraging, but it's not what you see more broadly in Asia and emerging markets." GARY THAYER, SENIOR ECONOMIST, WELLS FARGO ADVISORS, ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI: "The manufacturing sector benefits when we see non-defense ex-aircraft orders increase. This is potentially a sign that the worst of the weakness in business spending is behind us and we could see modest improvement in capital spending in the second half of the year." WILLIAM LARKIN, FIXED INCOME PORTFOLIO MANAGER, CABOT MONEY  MANAGEMENT, SALEM, MASSACHUSETTS: "This tends to be a volatile number. I'm surprised that we're not getting a bigger reaction, because durable goods ex-transportation is the positive. That probably puts us in a good stance for the equity open, but it'll be slightly on the negative side for the bond market. It is good news. The data is starting to normalize a little bit. We were coming off some severe negatives, so from that standpoint I'm looking at more of a normalization. On the economic data today we're getting a lot of distortions because we're at a bottoming phase, so it's nice to see things coming into a normal range, and that's the positive."
