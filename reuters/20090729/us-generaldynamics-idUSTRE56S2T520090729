 ATLANTA  (Reuters) - Defense contractor General Dynamics Corp ( GD.N ) reported a higher-than-expected quarterly profit on Wednesday, and said it saw signs that the business jet market was stabilizing. 

 The maker of tanks, ships and submarines raised its full-year forecast, and its shares moved up 2 percent in afternoon trading. "We're seeing signs of the economy in general bottoming," said Matt Collins, senior capital-goods analyst at Edward Jones. "You usually get a little bit of a lag in the business jet market, so it is nice to see it bottoming out as well." Second-quarter net earnings fell 3.6 percent to $618 million, or $1.60 a share, from $641 million, or $1.60 a share, a year earlier. Excluding discontinued operations, profit was $1.61 a share, topping the analysts' average forecast of $1.57, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue rose 11 percent to $8.10 billion, while analysts were expecting $8.14 billion. Analysts cited better-than-expected margin performance, particularly in business jets. Aerospace operating margins came to 15.2 percent in the second quarter, down from 18.1 percent a year earlier but up from 13.7 percent in the first quarter. During a conference call, General Dynamics said the business jet market, which has seen falling shipments as corporations cut back discretionary spending, remained difficult but was gradually improving. Aerospace accounted for 17.5 percent of the company's second-quarter revenue. "There continue to be several encouraging signs that the business jet market is stabilizing," General Dynamics Chief Executive Jay Johnson said. They include increased flying hours at the Gulfstream jet division, a drop in customer defaults and increased new-order interest. At Gulfstream, "we saw margins improve on lower deliveries," showing progress at keeping costs under control, Collins said. On Tuesday, jet rival Textron Inc ( TXT.N ), the parent of Cessna, also said the business-jet market was stabilizing and noted order trends had improved in June from previous months. General Dynamics said its combat systems segment, which supplies tanks and machine guns, had a quarterly revenue increase of 19 percent, while operating profit rose 6 percent. Its marine systems and information systems divisions posted revenue increases of 17 percent and 4 percent, respectively. The company, which expects to complete the acquisition of imaging systems maker Axsys Technologies Inc AXYS.O in the third quarter, said it expected continued support for its tanks and armored vehicles from the U.S. Defense Department, which is moving to scale back some traditional weapons programs and devote more funds to irregular warfare. Concerns that U.S. defense spending will slow is weighing on military contractors. "The defense business is going to be modest-to-no-growth, and aerospace isn't getting worse, but that doesn't mean that we're back to growth," said James McIlree, an analyst with financial advisory firm Collins Stewart. General Dynamics said it expects full-year profit from continuing operations of $6.05 to $6.15 a share, compared with an April forecast of $6.00 to $6.10 a share. The company's shares were up $1.03 to $54.77 in afternoon trading. (Reporting by Karen Jacobs; Editing by John Wallace, Lisa Von Ahn, Phil Berlowitz)
