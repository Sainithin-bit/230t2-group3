 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - ConocoPhillips ( COP.N ) expects its global refinery utilization rates to be in the mid-80 percent range in 2009, with rates slightly higher in the United States, company officials said on Wednesday. 

 Although its refineries are operating at reduced rates due to the current economics, none of the company's refineries are on the verge of shutdown, Conoco officials said in a quarterly earnings conference call. Conoco has scaled back its coking rates, however, but has not shut down any cokers totally, they said. In addition, the company said that the expansion of its 306,000-barrel-per-day refinery in Wood River, Illinois, was "moving along as planned." The $1.9 billion project will expand the refinery's capacity to process heavy Canadian crude oil. The refinery is a joint-venture between ConocoPhillips and EnCana ( ECA.TO ).
