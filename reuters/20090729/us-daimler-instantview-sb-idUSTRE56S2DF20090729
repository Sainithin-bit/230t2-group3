 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Daimler ( DAIGn.DE ) said on Wednesday it expects a gradual improvement in its operating profitability over the course of this year, after it beat expectations for an even worse second-quarter operating loss. 

 Following are some analyst comments on the results: JUERGEN PIEPER, BANKHAUS METZLER: "The mood is far too positive. While the results are better than expected, with these figures Daimler is among the weakest of Europe's car makers. Particularly the outlook is not very convincing." GEORG STUERZER, UNICREDIT "The figures were better than the consensus. Particularly the free cash flow is better than expected. That's the key point." MARC RENE TONN, MM WARBURG "What also stands out positively is that Financial Services had a positive result in the second quarter. Some people had probably feared that the losses seen in the first quarter would continue." MICHAEL PUNZET, DZ BANK "We are still skeptical on the sales development in the second half. On trucks we expect no significant improvement in the second half. We therefore confirm our negative view on Daimler." TIM SCHULDT, EQUINET "At first glance, the numbers look good. Particularly the most important number, the EBIT from continuing operations, was significantly above expectations. The very good cash flow was a positive surprise as well." STUART PEARSON, CREDIT SUISSE "We reiterate our outperform recommendation and preference for premium makers, who should benefit from improving fleet markets in 2010, while mass makers will suffer from a scrappage overhang."
