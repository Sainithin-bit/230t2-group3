 (Reuters) - The U.S. government wants to boost oversight of commodity markets by increasing regulation of over-the-counter derivatives, clamping down on excessive speculation and expanding the power of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. 

 Following are details of government initiatives to step up oversight of commodity trading: CFTC HEARINGS * CFTC held public hearings on July 28-29 "to address the current application of position limits and exemptions from position limits in energy markets." Another hearing is scheduled for August 5. * CFTC Chairman Gary Gensler stressed that "every option must be on the table" to combat excessive speculation. * Gensler also expressed concerns that exempting some investors from proposed position limits would undermine efforts to rein in speculators. CFTC PROPOSALS Commissioner Bart Chilton told Reuters he wanted to see proposed rules by September, opened for public comment and implemented by October or November. [ID:nN10514382] CFTC Chairman Gary Gensler has proposed reforms that include: * All derivatives dealers should face rules regarding capital, margin, conduct and record keeping. * Derivatives dealers should be subject to record-keeping and reporting requirements for all of their OTC derivatives positions and transactions. * Conservative capital requirements, conservative margin requirements and strong business conduct standards would have to be upheld by all OTC derivatives dealers as part of the administration's plan. * CFTC should have the authority to impose record-keeping and reporting requirements on all OTC derivatives. OBAMA ADMINISTRATION The administration's regulatory reform plan calls for standardized over-the-counter derivatives to be traded on regulate markets and to go through central clearinghouses that would assess risk and assign margin requirements. Trading in customized derivatives would be reported to trade repositories. A broad definition of standardized OTC derivatives would be written to help steer trading onto exchanges. Customized transactions would face higher capital and margin requirements. All OTC derivative dealers and market participants would be covered by capital, margin and reporting rules. The Obama administration has directed the Securities Exchange Commission and CFTC to iron out opposing philosophies in favor of common rules. HOUSE CLIMATE CHANGE The climate change bill passed by the U.S. House would expand federal regulations by banning "naked" credit default swaps and requiring over-the-counter derivatives to go through central clearinghouses. It also directs the CFTC to set position limits on energy traders and brings energy swaps under CFTC oversight. Some of the proposals in the climate bill, such as mandatory clearing of OTC derivatives, are part of the Obama administration's proposal for financial regulatory reform. SENATE REVIEWS SPECULATION IN WHEAT A 247-page report from the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations blamed big speculators for overinflating wheat prices in recent years. The report said commodity index funds drove up wheat prices so high that it became impossible for grain firms using the Chicago Board of Trade contracts to hedge their positions. The Subcommittee recommended the CFTC enforce the standard limit of 6,500 positions for index traders in the wheat market and phase out existing waivers. Its chairman, Senator Carl Levin, said the CFTC should take a closer look at the role index traders have played in price moves for other commodities, such as oil. SENATE BILLS Pending at the Senate Agriculture Committee, S 272 would end OTC financial transactions by requiring all trading of them, including credit default swaps, to be on federally regulated exchanges. A second bill, S 447, filed by Senator Carl Levin and referred to the Agriculture Committee, would expand CFTC powers to prevent excessive speculation. Main points: * CFTC would convene a working group of international regulators to develop uniform reporting and regulatory standards to protect energy futures from excessive speculation, manipulation or trading practices that pose systemic risk. * CFTC would set position limits on energy and agricultural futures contracts. Exchanges must adopt and enforce position limits on contracts with a significant price-discovery role. * CFTC would have oversight of any major commodity market disturbance that disrupts liquidity or price discovery. - Index and swaps dealers would be required to provide detailed reports of their activities. HOUSE BILL Approved by the House Agriculture Committee, HR 977 requires clearing of OTC transactions, expands CFTC's powers to control speculation and gives CFTC criminal-prosecution power. Its main points are: * OTC transactions must be cleared through central clearinghouses, unless the CFTC grants an exemption. * CFTC can suspend trading in "naked" credit default swaps related to securities barred from short-selling by the Securities and Exchange Commission. * CFTC is required to set position limits for physically deliverable commodities for the spot month, each month and aggregate totals for all months. * If needed to assure liquidity and unbiased price discovery in agricultural and energy futures markets, CFTC can impose position limits on look-alike OTC contracts.
