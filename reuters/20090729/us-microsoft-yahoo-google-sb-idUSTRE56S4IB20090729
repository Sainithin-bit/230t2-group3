 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Search engine giant Google Inc said it was "interested" in Microsoft's 10-year search deal with Yahoo announced on Wednesday, adding that competition was usually good for online users. 

 "There has traditionally been a lot of competition online, and our experience is that competition brings about great things for users," said Google spokesman Adam Kovakovich. "We're interested to learn more about the deal," he said in an emailed statement. Google made a search ad deal with Yahoo in June 2008 but scrapped it because of objections from the Justice Department. Advertisers had hotly opposed it, fearing Google and Yahoo's dominance of the market could mean higher prices. Yahoo initially struck the deal with Google as a way to fend off an unsolicited takeover bid from Microsoft. Microsoft had lobbied hard against the Google/Yahoo partnership.
