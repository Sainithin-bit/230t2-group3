 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The 10-year search deal between Yahoo and Microsoft warrants "careful scrutiny," the chairman of the U.S. Senate antitrust panel said on Wednesday. 

 "The deal between Yahoo and Microsoft -- industry giants and direct competitors in Internet advertising and search markets -- warrants our careful scrutiny," said Sen. Herb Kohl, who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee's antitrust panel. Kohl said his panel was concerned about "the potentially far-reaching consequences for consumers and advertisers, and our concern about dampening the innovation we have come to expect from a competitive high-tech industry." "The implications of this proposed joint agreement will be closely reviewed by my subcommittee," he said. (Reporting by  Diane Bartz ; Editing by  Derek Caney )
