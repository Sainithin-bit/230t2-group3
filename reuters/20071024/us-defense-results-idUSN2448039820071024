 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Top-tier defense contractors Northrop Grumman Corp ( NOC.N ) and General Dynamics Corp ( GD.N ) posted higher third-quarter profit on Wednesday and raised their financial forecasts on the back of strong U.S. military spending. 

 Boeing Co ( BA.N ) also reported higher profit overall, but its defense unit -- which makes up half of the company's sales -- said profit fell as it took a one-time charge, and it warned of relatively slow growth in its military business. The broadly positive results come a day after Lockheed Martin Corp ( LMT.N ), the world's largest defense contractor, beat Wall Street's profit expectations and raised its full-year forecast on record Pentagon spending and demand for its jets. Northrop, which is the U.S. No. 3 defense contractor, beat Wall Street's profit forecasts on Wednesday, and also raised its full-year profit forecast, helped by strong sales at its information technology and shipbuilding units. Northrop, like its rivals, is concentrating more on information technology and civil projects, as a way of hedging risk that the traditional business of building defense hardware eventually slows down. The company, based in Los Angeles, made no financial projections for next year. Its shares rose $1.49, or 1.8 percent, to $81.01 on the New York Stock Exchange. GULFSTREAM BOOSTS GENERAL DYNAMICS General Dynamics also posted better-than-expected quarterly earnings and raised its full-year earnings forecast above Wall Street's expectations as it felt the benefit of strong demand for its military vehicles and business jets. The No. 4 U.S. defense contractor, which makes Abrams tanks, Stryker fighting vehicles and submarines and ships for the U.S. Navy, was boosted by a 37 percent jump in sales at its military vehicles unit, which is seeing increased business supplying U.S. forces in Iraq and Afghanistan. Its Gulfstream unit posted a 21 percent jump in sales as the global market for business jets continues to grow. General Dynamics' shares rose $1.73, or 2 percent, to $88.80 on the NYSE. Boeing, whose defense unit ranks as the Pentagon's No. 2 supplier, sounded a more downbeat note. The company's overall profit rose sharply, but the defense unit posted a 6 percent drop in operating profit, as sales grew only modestly and it took a $94 million charge on its Delta II rocket program. Boeing raised its forecast for full-year defense revenue to $32 billion from $31 billion, but it kept its 2008 revenue forecast at a range of $32 billion to $33 billion, implying little or no growth in sales next year. "The military side is turning a bit weak," said aerospace analyst Paul Nisbet at JSA Research. "If anything there's less money for missile defense." Boeing's shares fell $1.13 to $93.80 on the NYSE.
