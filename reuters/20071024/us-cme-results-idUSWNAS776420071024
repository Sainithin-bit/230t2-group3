 (Reuters) - CME Group Inc CME.N, parent of the world's largest futures exchange, said quarterly profit rose 94 percent driven by growth in its agricultural, equity index, foreign exchange and interest rate products, as well as its energy and metals derivatives processing business. 

 The Chicago-based company, which bought its rival the Chicago Board of Trade in July, said third-quarter net income rose to $201.6 million, or $3.87 per share, from $103.8 million, or $2.95 per share, a year earlier. Excluding merger-related costs, the company earned $4.31 per share for the quarter. Total revenue increased 106 percent to $565.2 million. Analysts on average had expected earnings of $4.12 per share, before special items, on revenue of $579.4 million, according to Reuters estimates. (Reporting by Dilipp S. Nag in Bangalore)
