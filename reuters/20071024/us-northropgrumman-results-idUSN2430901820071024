 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Defense contractor Northrop Grumman Corp ( NOC.N ) said on Wednesday third-quarter profit rose more than expected, helped by strong sales at its information technology and shipbuilding units. 

 The No. 3 Pentagon supplier behind Lockheed Martin Corp ( LMT.N ) and Boeing Co ( BA.N ) also raised its full-year profit forecast but made no projections for next year. Northrop reported quarterly net profit of $489 million, or $1.41 per share, compared with $302 million, or 86 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter. Results beat Wall Street's earnings forecast of $1.27 per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue rose 7 percent to $7.9 billion, a little below analysts' average estimate of $7.95 billion. The company raised its full-year profit forecast to about $5.10 per share, up from its previous estimate of $4.90 to $5.05 per share. Analysts are expecting $5.05 per share, on average. Northrop kept its forecast of about $31.5 billion revenue for the full year. Analysts are expecting $31.61 billion on average. The company has not yet made any forecasts for 2008.
