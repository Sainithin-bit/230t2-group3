 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc ( CCE.N ) reported higher quarterly profit as a one-time tax benefit and other gains offset a decline in shipments in the United States and Europe for the largest bottler of Coca-Cola Co ( KO.N ) drinks. 

 The company posted net income of $268 million, or 55 cents per share, for the third quarter, compared with $213 million, or 44 cents per share, a year ago. Excluding items, the company earned 44 cents per share, down from 45 cents a year ago, as high prices for aluminum and sweetener took a toll.
