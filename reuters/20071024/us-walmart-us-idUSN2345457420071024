 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc ( WMT.N ) should be seen as a "growth" business that still has numerous opportunities to boost sales results at existing U.S. stores, the head of the retailer's U.S. operations said on Tuesday. 

 "You will hopefully conclude that we are a growth business," Eduardo Castro-Wright said at the retailer's analyst meeting, which was broadcast over the Web. The world's largest retailer is facing questions from investors about how much more it can grow in its home country. It has saturated many markets with more than 4,000 U.S. stores, and its sales at existing U.S. stores, or comparable stores sales, rose at their lowest pace on record last fiscal year. The meeting also comes as Wal-Mart's core lower-income customers are being squeezed by higher fuel and food costs, and Castro-Wright said the "mortgage crisis" and credit crunch were affecting consumer's shopping behavior. "We have a challenging economic environment out there," he said, adding that the retailer's comparable store performance "is not what we would like it to be." But he touted the momentum the retailer has in its "health and wellness" business, which includes its pharmacies; its grocery business; and its electronics businesses. He said the three areas account for two-thirds of its business. Wal-Mart plans to add more drugs to its $4 generic prescription drug program, he said, and would continue to emphasize the name brands it sells in its electronics area. But it is still struggling in its home and apparel areas, which make up almost the remaining one-third of its business. "In the case of apparel, we are not pleased with the performance of the business," he said. "It's only marginally better this year than it was last year." To boost sales in its home area, which includes merchandise like bedding and bath accessories, it will introduce more brands. Wal-Mart will launch the new Canopy line of home decor goods in stores nationwide in February. It also said it has a deal with Meredith Corp ( MDP.N ) to launch a line of Better Homes and Gardens home products, such as bedding and decorative pillows, in its stores this fall. "Home is improving," he said. But investors did not seem satisfied by the plans. Wal-Mart shares fell 3 percent to $43.93 on the New York Stock Exchange despite its announcing plans at the meeting to trim capital spending and the number of new supercenters it will open. On Wednesday, Wal-Mart will discuss its Sam's Club warehouse division and its international business, and Chief Executive Lee Scott will address the meeting. (Reporting by  Nicole Maestri )
