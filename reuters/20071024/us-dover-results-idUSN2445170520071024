 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Diversified manufacturer Dover Corp ( DOV.N ) said on Wednesday that quarterly net profit rose 4 percent, helped by recent acquisitions, but it forecast some moderation in the current period, sending its shares down 5.8 percent. 

 Analysts said earnings estimates for the fourth quarter were likely to be cut in the coming days, after Chief Executive Ron Hoffman told analysts on a conference call that the business climate was "moderating," and the company would take restructuring charges of up to $8 million in the fourth quarter. "Given these factors, plus the normal effects of seasonality, we believe our fourth-quarter performance will be modestly improved over the same period last year," Hoffman said. The construction market is likely to remain challenging, he said, while demand may soften for supermarket equipment in the quarter. "We are just being conservative and saying we anticipate some moderation in the fourth quarter," he said. Hoffman said earnings per share were likely to grow at a high-single-digit percentage rate in the fourth quarter. Analysts were expecting profit of 88 cents per share for the period, up nearly 16 percent from 76 cents a year earlier, according to Reuters Estimates. Current estimates are probably too "aggressive," Goldman Sachs analyst Terry Darling said in a note. "Street estimates show 19 percent growth, which means numbers will be coming down," probably by about 10 cents per share, JP Morgan analyst Stephen Tusa said about the fourth quarter. Third-quarter net earnings rose to $174.6 million, or 86 cents per share, from $167.5 million, or 82 cents a share, a year earlier. Earnings from continuing operations were 88 cents a share, 1 cent higher than the analysts' average forecast, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue rose 15 percent to $1.84 billion, compared with estimates of $1.83 billion. Dover said acquisitions accounted for 10 percentage points of the increase, while a weak U.S. dollar contributed two points. Dover's engineered systems division posted the most growth, with sales up 30 percent and earnings rising 26 percent. The segment makes product identification systems and specialty printers, among other products. In morning New York Stock Exchange trading, Dover shares fell $2.79 to $46.56.
