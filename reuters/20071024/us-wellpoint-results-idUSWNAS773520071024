 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Health insurer WellPoint Inc ( WLP.N ) said on Wednesday that third-quarter profit rose 7 percent, helped by higher membership and improved control of operating costs. 

 The largest U.S. health insurer by membership also projected that 2008 earnings per share will rise by at least 15 percent. Net income increased to $868 million, or $1.45 per share, from $810.8 million, or $1.29 per share, a year earlier. Excluding net realized investment gains, earnings were $1.44 per share, in line with analysts' expectations, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue rose 5.4 percent to $15.2 billion. Goldman Sachs analyst Matthew Borsch said the quarterly results were as expected, but predicted that investors would take a positive view of the preliminary 2008 forecast. WellPoint has struggled this year with health care costs for its Medicaid plans for low-income Americans and has shuffled its top executives. It is the second major insurer to report third-quarter earnings. Last week, UnitedHealth Group Inc ( UNH.N ) posted a 15 percent rise in profit, but analysts were disappointed with its forecast. Health plan membership at Indianapolis-based WellPoint totaled 34.8 million members at the end of the quarter, 615,000 more members than a year earlier and 38,000 more than at the end of the second quarter. Additions to its national accounts and Medicaid business drove the membership gains from a year before. WellPoint's benefit expense ratio -- the percent of premiums spent on medical costs -- worsened to 81.8 percent from 81.3 percent a year earlier, due largely to costs in its Medicare and Medicaid plans. The company's sales, general and administrative expenses improved to 14.6 percent of revenue from 15.5 percent a year earlier. The company nudged up its 2007 profit per share forecast by a penny to $5.56, while slightly reducing its projection for full-year revenue and membership at year-end. WellPoint said it is committed to earnings-per-share growth of at least 15 percent, although it said it would provide a specific 2008 outlook in December. It did project adding more than 1 million members next year. Borsch said that WellPoint's outlook implies 2008 earnings per share of about $6.40, 2 cents above Wall Street's target. The company's shares are up about 1 percent in 2007, underperforming a 12 percent rise for the Morgan Stanley Healthcare Payor index .HMO, a broad gauge of health insurer stocks.
