 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Industrial gas suppliers Praxair Inc ( PX.N ) and Air Products & Chemicals Inc ( APD.N ) reported strong quarterly results on Wednesday that exceeded Wall Street's expectations, but shares of the companies swung in different directions. 

 Shares of Praxair rose 82 cents or 1 percent to $83.84, while those of Air Products fell $2.31 or 2.4 percent to $94.86 in afternoon trade on the New York Stock Exchange. Jefferies & Co analyst Laurence Alexander said Air Products shares fell as their outlook was only in line with Wall Street's expectations, while Praxair raised its outlook above market expectations. "One company (Air Products) beat the quarter and their outlook is in line with expectations, while the other company (Praxair) beat the quarter and raised expectations," said Alexander. Praxair, which services the aerospace, automotive, electronics and other industries, said its third-quarter earnings rose, helped by new business and project start-ups in Asia and South America. Net income increased to $305 million, or 94 cents a share, from $247 million, or 75 cents a share, a year earlier, the Danbury, Connecticut-based company said. Analysts on average had forecast earnings of 91 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. The company forecast fourth-quarter earnings of 95 to 97 cents a share and raised its full-year forecast to around $3.60 a share, from a prior range of $3.50 to $3.55. Wall Street was expecting earnings of 94 cents a share in the fourth-quarter and $3.55 a share for the full year. "Our pipeline of future projects continues to grow, which provides visibility for double-digit sales growth over the next two to three years," said Chief Executive Steve Angel, in a statement. Air Products, which is one of the world's largest suppliers of gases to the electronics industry, said quarterly profit more than doubled, boosted by higher pricing and volumes in its merchant gases segment. Net income rose to $292.8 million, or $1.31 a share, in the fourth quarter ended September 30 from $128.4 million, or 57 cents a share, a year earlier, when the company took charges for a reorganization and the sale of a business. Excluding items, the company posted earnings from continuing operations of $1.17 a share. Analysts on average were expecting $1.15, according to Reuters Estimates. Quarterly revenue rose 12 percent to $2.60 billion, slightly shy of Wall Street's forecast of $2.65 billion. Air Products said it expects fiscal first-quarter earnings of $1.08 per share to $1.13 per share and fiscal 2008 earnings of $4.80 to $5.00. Wall Street has forecast earnings of $1.13 a share and $4.88 a share, respectively. The company also agreed to sell its high-purity process chemicals business to KMG Chemicals Inc KMGB.O for $74.6 million. Last month, both Praxair and Air Products raised prices for certain products in North America, citing escalating materials, labor and energy costs. Airgas Inc ( ARG.N ), a distributor of industrial, medical, and specialty gases, is expected to report fiscal second-quarter earnings after the market close on Wednesday. Shares of all three industrial gas suppliers have enjoyed a strong run-up this year. Shares of Praxair have risen about 40 percent year-to-date, while those of Air Products and Airgas have risen about 35 percent and 25 percent, respectively.
