 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - CME Group Inc. CME.N, parent of the world's largest futures exchange, said on Wednesday that third-quarter profit nearly doubled on trading growth across its range of futures and options products. 

 The Chicago-based company said third-quarter net income rose to $201.6 million, or $3.87 per share, from $103.8 million, or $2.95 per share, a year earlier. Excluding merger-related costs, the company earned $4.31 per share for the quarter. Total revenue increased 106 percent to $565.2 million. Analysts on average had expected earnings of $4.12 per share, before special items, on revenue of $579.4 million, according to Reuters estimates. CME's stronger-than-expected results reflected a combination of lower expenses and higher investment income, Edward Ditmire, analyst at Fox-Pitt Kelton in New York, said in a research note. In early trading on the New York Stock Exchange CME shares surged to $664.46, up $29.86 or 4.7 percent. CME Group was formed in July when Chicago Mercantile Exchange Holdings bought the Chicago Board of Trade. Since completing the merger the stock is up more than 11 percent. CME Chairman Terry Duffy told analysts on a conference call that combination of the two exchanges' trading facilities is going smoothly and according to plan. The exchange previously reported a 49-percent increase in third-quarter derivatives trading volume, to 12.7 million contracts a day. Volatility in global financial markets during the quarter helped push CME trading volume higher, especially in the interest rate, equity index and currency segments. CME's average rate per contract, a key measure of margins, slipped to 62.2 cents in the third quarter from 63.9 cents in the second quarter. CME said late on Tuesday it intends to take an equity stake of about 10 percent the Brazilian Mercantile & Futures Exchange S.A. (BM&F), the world's fourth largest derivatives market. BM&F will take a 2-percent equity stake in CME. BM&F is the largest derivatives exchange in Latin America. Its major product lines are Brazilian interest rates and foreign exchange. "This is an interesting tie-up which brings a major exchange into a close relationship with CME; something that could lead to synergies in the longer term," Ditmire said. The exchange also said it will sign a letter of intent on Wednesday with South Korea's Korea Exchange to list the popular KOSPI 200 futures contract on CME's electronic Globex platform in 2008.
