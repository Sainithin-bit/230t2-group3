 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Some big Cablevision Systems Corp ( CVC.N ) stockholders may drop opposition and vote in favor of the Dolan family's $10.6 billion buyout bid for the media company, the New York Post reported on Wednesday, citing sources familiar with the matter. 

 It said Harris Associates and Anchor Capital Advisors, who together hold over 3 percent of Cablevision shares, will vote in favor of the deal. The paper said T. Rowe Price, Cablevision's third biggest stockholder with a 5.7 percent stake, may also vote for the deal after previously opposing it. However, it said ClearBridge Advisors, the biggest institutional shareholder, continues to oppose the deal. The company is expected to disclose the results of the vote this week.
