 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Procter & Gamble ( PG.N ) hiked listed coffee prices for some of its Folgers Coffee blends effective October 23 due to higher prices for both arabica and robusta beans, a company spokesman said Wednesday. 

 P&G, the largest U.S. roaster, raised Folgers Ground by 10 cents or 4 percent per 10.5 to 13 ounce package equivalent, said Bryan Brown. One New Jersey grocery store gave its retail price for the product at $3.69 a lb. Increases ranging from six to eight percent were also made for Folgers Instant, Cappuccino, Singles and Home Cafe. "No change in the gourmet side of the business, Millstone Coffee or the Dunkin' Donuts retail coffee," Brown said. The affected brands use both arabica and robusta coffee beans, with the exception of Folgers Instant, which uses only robusta. Robusta beans are typically used to make instant coffee or are blended with ground arabica beans to make a less expensive brewed coffee. "The list price of Folgers products reflects the price of green coffee sold on the commodity market and when green coffee market changes are significant and sustained, as in the case this time, we generally adjust our list prices," Brown said. The company made its decision based on the 30-day moving average of both types of beans, as of Monday, Brown said. Arabica coffee futures, which trade on ICE Futures U.S., soared to a near eight-year high at $1.4080 per lb on October 12 in a sustained rally based on concern about severely dry weather in the world's top grower Brazil. Prices then fell to one-month lows as rains fell on the coffee belt. On the same day on London's LIFFE market, the spot-month November robusta contract LKDX7 soared to a contract high of $2,234 per tonne. On Tuesday, ICE's key December arabica futures contract KCZ7 closed up 0.30 cent at $1.2385 a lb while LIFFE's most-active January robusta contract LKDF8 finished up $3 at $1,775 a tonne. P&G most recently increased prices on some Folgers blends in early January due to the steady rise in green arabica bean prices, and in October 2006 due to higher robusta prices. The price hikes were quickly followed by other major U.S. roasters like Chock full o'Nuts and Maxwell House.
