 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Bank of America Corp ( BAC.N ), the second-largest U.S. bank, plans to lay off 3,000 people in its corporate and investment banking unit, including its chief, the Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday, citing people familiar with the situation. 

 The unit posted a 93 percent decline in earnings, which contributed to a larger-than-expected 32 percent drop in overall profit to $3.7 billion. Chief Executive Kenneth Lewis said he expected to scale back the unit. Gene Taylor, the head of the unit, would be replaced by Brian Moynihan, now head of global wealth and investment management, the newspaper said. Moynihan told the Journal the shake-up was not a wholesale retreat from investment banking but an effort to begin rebuilding. Bank of America did not immediately return requests for comment.
