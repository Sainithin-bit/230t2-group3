 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Anheuser-Busch Cos Inc ( BUD.N ) said on Wednesday quarterly profit rose as the nation's largest brewer sold more beer at higher prices. The maker of Budweiser and Bud Light reported net income of $706.7 million, or 95 cents per share, for the third quarter compared to $637.5 million, or 82 cents per share, a year ago. Anheuser controls nearly half the U.S. beer market but has lagged its rivals in other countries, where there is more growth. The company has sought to diversify with equity stakes in Mexican brewer Modelo ( GMODELOC.MX ) and China's Tsingtao ( 600600.SS ) as well as distribution deals with InBev NV INTB.BR, Grolsch GROLc.AS and Hansen Natural Corp HANS.O.
