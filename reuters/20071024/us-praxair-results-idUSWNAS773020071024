 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Industrial gas supplier Praxair Inc ( PX.N ) said on Wednesday that third-quarter earnings rose, helped by strong growth in Asia and South America from new business and project start-ups. 

 Net income increased to $305 million, or 94 cents a share, from $247 million, or 75 cents a share, a year earlier, the Danbury, Connecticut-based company said. Analysts on average had forecast earnings of 91 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. In July, Praxair had forecast earnings of 89 cents to 91 cents a share for the third quarter and $3.50 to $3.55 for the full year. Last month, the company increased the prices of packaged gas products in the United States and Canada, citing rising raw material, labor and fuel costs, and limited production capacity.
