 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Truck leasing and logistics company Ryder System Inc ( R.N ) posted slightly higher quarterly profit on Wednesday as its supply chain solutions business offset falling demand for commercial rentals amid the slowing U.S. economy. 

 Third-quarter net income edged up to $65.5 million, or $1.11 a share, from $65.3 million, or $1.06 a share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time charges related to restructuring and pension costs, Ryder earned $1.14 a share. Analysts' average forecast was $1.13, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue rose to $1.65 billion from $1.62 billion. Analysts had expected $1.67 billion. Miami-based Ryder cut its profit forecast in early October, saying softness in the economy had spread beyond the housing sector. Many U.S. trucking companies -- always among the first to benefit from an economic uptick and the first to be hurt when growth slows -- say the weakness has been largely restricted to the housing sector. But some trucking executives, such as those at YRC Worldwide Inc ( YRCW.O ), have warned that the United States may be headed for a recession. Ryder said third-quarter revenue at its supply chain solutions business rose to $554 million from $513.8 million a year earlier, but sales at its commercial rental unit fell to $155.0 million from $181.5 million. Unlike Ryder's fixed-term contract business for leasing vehicle fleets, its commercial rental fleet uses short-term contracts, and business fluctuates with market demand. "Our team continues to take appropriate steps to manage the business effectively in a softer economic environment," Chief Executive Greg Swienton said in a statement. "The actions we've already taken to reduce the commercial rental fleet size are expected to improve asset utilization levels going forward." Ryder said it now expects fourth-quarter earnings of $1.06 to $1.11 a share. Analysts' average forecast is $1.09. For the full year, Ryder expects $4.10 to $4.15 per share, compared with analysts' expectations of $4.13. Ryder shares were down 70 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $46.67 in morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange. The shares hit a 52-week high of $57.70 on August 8 and a 52-week low of $45.25 on October 8, the day the company cut its outlook. (Reporting by  Nick Carey )
