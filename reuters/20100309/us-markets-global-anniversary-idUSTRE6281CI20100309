 LONDON  (Reuters) - Equities have had a volatile 2010 so far, but globally they remain around 73 percent higher than the low ebb of the financial crisis exactly 12 months ago. 

 MSCI's all-country world stock index .MIWD00000PUS, a broad measure of global equities, hit a low on March 9, 2009. The index then rose around 80 percent before hitting a high on January 11, this year. On Tuesday, the index was down 0.8 percent, for a year to date gain of just 0.1 percent. But the index is up some 73 percent from its closing low one year ago.
