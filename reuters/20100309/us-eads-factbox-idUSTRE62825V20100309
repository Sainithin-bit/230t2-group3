 (Reuters) - Airbus parent EADS ( EAD.PA ) fell to a loss in 2009 its results showed on Tuesday. 

 It scrapped its dividend as a charge on the Airbus A380 superjumbo and a currency hit added to an already announced provision on the delayed A400M military transport plane. It also confirmed it would not bid for a U.S. Air Force mid-air refueling plane contract after its partner Northrop Grumman ( NOC.N ) backed out. Here are some key figures and events related to EADS: EADS DETAILS Market Capitalization - 13.02 billion euros Airbus delivered 498 aircraft vs 482 in 2008 Net loss 763 mln euros vs 2008 net profit 1.57 bln Operating loss 322 mln euros vs 2008 operating profit 2.8 bln Loss provision for A400M 1.8 bln euros Charge of 240 mln euros on costs of assembling A380 superjumbo Revenue 42.8 billion euros vs 43.3 bln in 2008 Revenue by segment: Airbus Commercial - 26.3 billion euros Defense & Security - 5.3 billion euros Astrium - 4.7 billion euros Eurocopter - 4.5 billion euros Airbus Military - 2.2 billion euros KEY EVENTS U.S. TANKER -- EADS teams up with Northrop Grumman in 2005 to compete against Boeing Co. for a U.S. mid-air refueling tanker contract. The U.S. Air Force fleet of over 500 KC-135 tankers average over 40 years old. -- In February 2008 the U.S. Air Force awards the $35 billion tanker program to Northrop/EADS team but Boeing files a protest of the award with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) and launched a publicity campaign to highlight errors in the Air Force decision. GAO upheld Boeing's protest and recommended that the Air Force reopen the competition. -- The contract was estimated to be worth $50 billion. -- EADS confirms on March 9 that the Northrop Grumman/EADS team would not bid for the U.S. Air Force Tanker replacement program, a day after partner Northrop Grumman announced that they had decided not to bid. A400M -- In 2000 Airbus says it will start the industrial phase of the A400M project by March 2001, and first deliveries were to be expected in 2007. -- In 2001 eight European countries -- Germany, France, Spain, Britain, Turkey, Belgium, Portugal and Luxembourg -- sign a letter of intent to buy 196 A400Ms. -- In March 2007 Airbus takes a 352 million euro ($508.6 million) charge to cushion A400M overruns. -- In November 2009 South Africa cancels its A400M orders. -- In December 2009 as Airbus celebrates its maiden flight in Seville, Spain, Reuters reports that auditors had identified 11 billion euros of total cost overruns including development risk. -- On March 5, 2010, EADS clinches a long-awaited bailout with buyer nations costing taxpayers 3.5 billion euros. The deal aims to preserve 10,000 jobs by saving the project from collapse but forces EADS to shoulder a 1.8 billion euro provision Source: Reuters; Company website
