 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Toyota said on Tuesday it would fix all Tundra pickups sold in the United States for the 2000 to 2003 model years to address a risk that part of the truck's frame could corrode, causing spare tires or even the gas tank to drop to the road. 

 In November, Toyota Motor Corp recalled 110,000 Tundras sold in 20 cold-weather states, saying exposure to heavy road salt could cause the corrosion. Toyota spokesman Brian Lyons was unable to say how many additional vehicles would be involved. Toyota told its U.S. dealers in a notice on Tuesday that it would expand the recall to Tundras sold in all 50 U.S. states. Reuters reviewed a copy of the notice, which Lyons confirmed had been sent to the company's U.S. dealers. Toyota said the rear cross-member of the frame of the Tundra could corrode in some cases, and that could cause loss of rear brake circuits, making it harder for drivers to stop. In "the worst case," the fuel tank may drop to the ground and could be separated from the vehicle, potentially causing a crash or fire, the company said in its notice to dealers. This repair campaign adds to several safety problems with which Toyota, the world's largest automaker, is grappling. Toyota has recalled more than 8 million vehicles worldwide for mechanical problems with its accelerator assembly that can cause sticking and for the risk that floor mats could trap an accelerator. In February, Toyota recalled nearly 500,000 hybrids, including its top-selling Prius, because of braking problems. The Tundra, which Toyota redesigned in 2007, represents the Japanese automaker's attempt to crack a market for full-size work trucks that has been dominated by Ford Motor Co, General Motors Co and Chrysler.
