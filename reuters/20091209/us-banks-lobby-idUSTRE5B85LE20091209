 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Banks around the world are reforming compensation practices in line with government recommendations but they would like to see regulators coordinate globally on pay and bonuses, according to a report by an international bank lobby group. 

 Bankers' compensation has been a hot-button issue in many countries where governments have had to inject cash into banks struggling under rising writedowns and credit losses during the financial crisis. The report by the Institute of International Finance came as Britain's government said it would hit banks with a 50 percent tax levy on any bonus of more than 25,000 pounds ($40,840) in efforts to rein in multimillion-pound payouts. "Tax is a very blunt instrument to use," said Richard Waugh, chief executive of the Bank of Nova Scotia ( BNS.TO ) and co-chair of the IIF committee's report, in response to a question about Britain's move. Waugh said this form of taxation could have unintended consequences. Banks are concerned that varying rules on pay could give banks operating in countries with less stringent guidelines a recruiting advantage over banks in countries with harsher rules. "It's important that the authorities ensure a level playing field across the world," said Klaus-Peter Mueller, head of Commerzbank's ( CBKG.DE ) supervisory board and also co-chair of the committee's report. The report concluded that there are fewer banks offering multi-year guarantees and banks are now trying to tie bonuses more closely to longer-term performance. In addition, banks' boards are increasing involvement in the compensation process, according to the report. The report includes a survey based on interviews with chief executives, chief financial officers and chief risk officers at 38 banks and 10 other firms. Other topics covered by the report included risk management and governance, liquidity management, ratings and disclosure. (Reporting by  Elinor Comlay , editing by Matthew Lewis)
