 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar's three day rally stalled on Wednesday, encouraging foreign investors to buy some Wall Street stocks late in the day, but a series of negative sovereign credit rating actions across Europe and the Middle East dampened demand for high-yielding assets. 

 Commodity prices fell as investors became less willing to take on risk, with U.S. crude oil futures ending at a two-month low. European shares closed at their lowest in more than a week after Standard & Poor's warned it could downgrade Spain's AA-plus sovereign credit rating, one day after Fitch decided to cut Greece's rating to BBB-plus. Adding to global credit fears, Moody's announced it was reviewing the ratings of issuers related to the government not just of Dubai but of neighboring emirate Abu Dhabi, as well as the federal government of the seven-member United Arab Emirates federation. "The real issue is what this could do as countries turn to their taxpayers to raise revenue in order to protect their credit worthiness," said Kevin Caron, market strategist at Stifel, Nicolaus & Co in Florham Park, New Jersey. "This could mean higher tax rates when we have to pay for the stimulus, and that would hurt growth going forward." U.S. stocks staged a late rebound, however, as the government's decision to extend the $700 billion financial bailout fund, or TARP, until October 2010 boosted shares of banks. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  gained 51.08 points, or 0.50 percent, at 10,337.05, while the Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  ended up 4.01 points, or 0.37 percent, at 1,095.95. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  rose 10.74 points, or 0.49 percent, to 2,183.73. A CNBC report saying that Citigroup Inc. ( C.N ) plans to pay back TARP funds by raising cash in an equity offering also supported investor optimism, although shares of the bank closed 1.3 percent lower. "Weakness in the dollar late in the day, coupled with news that Citigroup is going to payback their TARP assistance, both have given the market a little bit of support," said Peter Kenny, managing director at Knight Equity Markets in Jersey City. In Europe, however, the FTSEurofirst 300  .FTEU3  index ended down 1.0 percent, the lowest close since November 30. The benchmark indicator is still up 20 percent this year and has surged 54 percent since hitting a record low in early March. The MSCI all-country world stock index .MIWD00000PUS lost 0.27 percent, while an emerging market stocks index .MSCIEF fell 0.68 percent. Prices of raw material also fell investors became more cautious and scaled down the recent "risk trade" which consists of buying stocks and commodities. U.S. light crude oil closed down $1.95, or 2.69 percent, to $70.67 per barrel, while spot gold prices were practically stable at $1,128.60 an ounce, after  hitting its lowest level in more than three weeks during the session, at 1,117.60. The Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index .CRB of 19 commodities futures was down 1.53 percent. DOLLAR HALTS GAINS The U.S. dollar halted a three-day winning streak as investors concluded the recent rally is overdone. The greenback was down against a basket of major trading-partner currencies, with the U.S. Dollar Index .DXY down 0.38 percent. Against the Japanese yen, the dollar was down 0.61 percent at 87.86. The euro was up 0.17 percent at $1.4723, however. "Neither of these developments, Spain or Greece and their sovereign credit ratings, can be interpreted as good for the euro," said Joseph Trevisani, chief market analyst at FX Solutions in Saddle River, New Jersey. "But the market has known about these things for some time so there won't be too big a reaction." Prices of U.S. Treasuries also fell, despite some safety bid, after a sale of $21 billion in 10-year notes attracted poor investor demand. Analysts said the deal suffered from bad timing, given many professional investors are unwilling to commit funds for longer periods this close to the year-end. The benchmark 10-year Treasury note was down 13/32, with the yield at 3.44 percent, compared with 3.39 percent late Tuesday. The 30-year Treasury bond was down 21/32, with the yield at 4.42 percent against 4.37 percent late Tuesday.
