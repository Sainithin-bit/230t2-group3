 TORONTO  (Reuters) - The Canadian Auto Workers (CAW) union has reached a tentative deal with General Motors Co ( GM.N ), CAW President Ken Lewenza told a press conference on Thursday, avoiding a strike that could have disrupted the company's North American production. 
 The union had said earlier on Thursday it would be set to serve General Motors Co ( GM.N ) with 24-hour strike notice later in the day if ongoing negotiations could not make progress on several contract issues. (Reporting by Allison Martell and  Jeffrey Hodgson ; Editing by Eric Meijer)
