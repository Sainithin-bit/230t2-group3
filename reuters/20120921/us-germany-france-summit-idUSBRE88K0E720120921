 BERLIN  (Reuters) - Angela Merkel and Francois Hollande will discuss the merger of European aerospace firm EADS ( EAD.PA ) and British defense firm BAE Systems ( BAES.L ) at a Franco-German summit on Saturday but will not make any decisions, a Merkel aide said on Friday. 
 "EADS/BAE will certainly be a topic at the working lunch with President Hollande, but there definitely won't be any decisions on Saturday," the German chancellor's spokesman, Steffen Seibert, told a news conference. The German and French leaders will also discuss plans for cross-border banking supervision by the European Central Bank but the meeting is "not the moment for making decisions", he added.
