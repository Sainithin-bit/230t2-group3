 BERLIN  (Reuters) - Daimler ( DAIGn.DE ), a major shareholder in EADS ( EAD.PA ), sees the valuation of a proposed deal between the European aerospace company and British defense company BAE Systems ( BAES.L ) critically, a person familiar with the matter said on Friday. 
 "The reaction of the capital markets has clearly shown that the economic valuation of the deal is being seen critically - Daimler sees it that way as well," a person familiar with the situation told Reuters on Friday. Daimler declined to comment. EADS is currently controlled by a partnership of German carmaker Daimler, French media firm Lagardere ( LAGA.PA ) and the French state. Daimler controls a 22.5 percent voting stake in EADS, holding a 15 percent direct stake and controlling the votes of a further 7.5 percent belonging to a consortium of private and public sector investors.
