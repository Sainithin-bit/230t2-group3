 LONDON  (Reuters) - - British oil company BP ( BP.L ) confirmed on Friday that it is interested in buying shares in Russian state controlled group Rosneft ( ROSN.MM ), provided the proposed sale of its stake in private Russian venture TNK-BP goes through. 
 "BP aims to be an investor in Russia for many decades to come," a spokesman said by email after Rosneft said it had received a proposal for a stake purchase by BP. "BP is considering further investment in Russia regardless of who we sell our stake to. Therefore if we are successful in selling our stake in TNK-BP then we would be interested in investing some of the proceeds in buying shares in Rosneft."
