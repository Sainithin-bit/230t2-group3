 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - A U.S. judge rejected Walmart's ( WMT.N ) request to dismiss a gender discrimination case filed in California, but said he would rule later about whether the plaintiffs had enough evidence to be certified as a class. 
 The ruling on Friday came from U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer in San Francisco federal court. (Reporting by Dan Levine; Editing by  Gary Hill )
