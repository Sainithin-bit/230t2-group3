 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Chevron Corp. ( CVX.N ), the No. 2 U.S. oil company, on Friday posted better-than-expected third-quarter earnings on improved margins at refineries and gas stations and high oil prices. 

 Earnings at the downstream unit -- which includes its refining, gasoline sales at the pump and transportation businesses -- rose sharply from last year when the company was forced to shut its largest U.S. refinery after Hurricane Katrina. "We've seen some excellent performance and high utilization at our refineries, and that contributed greatly to our financial results," Chief Financial Officer Steve Crowe said on a conference call with analysts. Net income in the quarter rose to $5.02 billion, or $2.29 a share, from $3.59 billion, or $1.64 a share, last year. The company said this year's results include net charges of about $95 million. The average earnings forecast of analysts polled by Reuters Estimates was $2.04 a share. Total revenue dipped to $54.21 billion from $54.46 billion last year. Earnings at the downstream unit rose to $1.44 billion from $573 million last year. The U.S. portion of that business performed especially well -- posting its best quarter in at least 6 years -- as its fuels refinery network operated at close to full capacity during the quarter, Chevron said. The downstream profit was well ahead of forecasts, according to James Halloran, an analyst with National City Private Client Group, which owns about 3 million Chevron shares. "They've shown flashes of excellent performance in downstream, and this is one of them," he said. He said the company had disclosed decent refining margins through August, but that most companies' refining margins had narrowed in September. Chevron's margins "must have held out pretty well," he said. Profits from the San Ramon, Calif.-based company's exploration and production operation rose to $3.5 billion from $3.32 billion last year. Chevron said worldwide production rose 6 percent to 2.7 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, with much of that growth due to the company's recent acquisition of Unocal. U.S. oil prices hit a record high of $78.40 a barrel in July and spent much of the third quarter hovering above $70 before retreating to around $60 as the summer driving season ended and geopolitical tensions eased. The average price for its crude oil in the United States was $63.98 per barrel up from $55.28 last year. Other oil majors also announced surging quarterly earnings this week. Exxon Mobil Corp. ( XOM.N ) posted a 6 percent gain on robust oil production and high crude prices. Royal Dutch Shell Plc ( RDSa.L ) said its underlying profit rose 21 percent and BP Plc ( BP.L ) announced a 58 percent rise, helped by asset sales. The high earnings provided critics of the U.S. majors with another conspicuous target charging that Chevron and others are gouging American consumers. Many are asking the U.S. government to impose a windfall tax on oil companies and repeal about $6 billion in tax breaks that Washington granted last year. "Big Oil is reaping billions in unwarranted profits while consumers struggle with sky-high gasoline, heating and electric bills," Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal said in a statement on Thursday. "Consumers should be outraged, and the federal government embarrassed by its own inaction." Shares of Chevron rose 61 cents to $68.11 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. They are up about 20 percent since the beginning of the year, just ahead of the Chicago Board Options Exchange's oil index .OIX during the same period.
