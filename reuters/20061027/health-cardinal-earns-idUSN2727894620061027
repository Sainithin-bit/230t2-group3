  By  Julie Steenhuysen CHICAGO  Oct 27 (Reuters) - Cardinal Health Inc. ( CAH.N ) on
Friday posted an 18 percent jump in quarterly profit on strong
growth in its drug distribution business, topping expectations,
but shares fell nearly 2 percent on continued troubles at its drug
manufacturing and hospital products units.  Cardinal said net profit rose to $270 million, or 66 cents per
share, in the first quarter ended Sept. 30, from $228 million, or
53 cents a year ago, which included a large charge.  Excluding special items but including options expenses,
earnings from continuing operations rose 27 percent to $320
million, or 78 cents per share. Analysts, on average, expected 76
cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates.  Shares were off 1.5 percent in morning trading.  Baird analyst Eric Coldwell said in a research note the drug
distribution business was strong, but the drug-manufacturing and
Clinical Technologies and Services, or CTS unit, "visibly missed
sales and margin targets."  Revenue from its CTS segment rose 3 percent to $549 million,
but operating earnings in the segment fell 14 percent to $68
million.  The unit was hurt by the late-August recall of its Alaris SE
pump infusion pump, an electronic device used to control the
delivery of intravenous solutions or medications.  Dublin, Ohio-based Cardinal suspended production, sales,
repairs and installations of the pumps after U.S. regulators
seized about 1,300 of the devices because they could pose a risk
to patients.  Cardinal said the unit also suffered from delays in two new
product introductions.  Revenue from its drug manufacturing unit gained 10 percent to
$451 million. Operating earnings were up 13 percent to $22 million
as strong growth in its softgel and quick-dissolve drug
manufacturing business offset continued declines in its sterile
manufacturing business.  Revenue from its drug-distribution business rose 12 percent to
$18.5 billion. Operating earnings rose 24 percent to $301 million,
helped by a strong mix of generic drug sales and cost control
measures, which were offset in part by continued pressure on
profit margins.  For fiscal 2007, Cardinal backed its view for non-GAAP diluted
earnings from operations of $3.50 to $3.70 per share. Analysts, on
average, expected $3.67 per share for the full year.  Total revenue rose 11 percent to $21.4 billion.  Cardinal stock fell 97 cents to $64.43 on the New York Stock
Exchange Friday.  Cardinal's shares have fallen nearly 5 percent so far this
year, underperforming chief drug wholesaler rivals McKesson Corp.
( MCK.N ), ahead nearly 2 percent in the same period, and
AmerisourceBergen Corp. ( ABC.N ), up 12 percent.
