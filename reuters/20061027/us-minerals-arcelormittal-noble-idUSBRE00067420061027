 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - Arcelor Mittal CELR.PA ( MT.N ), the world's largest steelmaker, said on Friday it would acquire a 40 percent stake in Noble International Ltd NOBL.O in a deal combining the two firms' laser-welding operations 

 Arcelor Mittal ( ISPA.AS ) said it had signed a binding agreement with U.S.-based Noble to merge Arcelor's laser-welded tailored blank business (TBA) with Noble, creating a company with an estimated post-transaction revenue and core profit for 2006 of $1.1 billion and $122 million respectively. The transaction is expected to close in March 2007, following satisfactory completion of due diligence by both parties. "Noble will leverage TBA's strong position in the European market and offer additional benefits for our global automotive customers," said Michel Wurther, a member of Arcelor Mittal's management board.
