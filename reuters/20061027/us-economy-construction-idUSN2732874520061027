 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. construction spending will fall 1 percent next year, the first drop since 1991, a report said on Friday, led by a decline in home building as the housing market continues to cool. 

 Home construction dominated the industry for the past five years. But the report, from Mcraw-Hill Construction, said building of single family home dwellings is expected to fall 15 percent in 2007. Single family home construction grew more than 10 percent in 2004 and 2005. "The construction industry in 2006 is going through a transition," the report said. The Commerce Department reported Friday that the slumping housing sector helped slow U.S. economic growth in the third quarter to its weakest pace in more than three years. The report showed a 17.4 percent annual rate of contraction in spending on new housing in the period.  The McGraw-Hill report said home construction dropped sharply during the 1990-1991 recession, but that fall-off was not from the dizzying highs the market has seen in recent years. It said Americans will spend $268 billion on single family home construction in 2007 -- a 7 percent drop -- on 1.275 million dwellings. At the same time, commercial, industrial and institutional spending will increase, the report forecast. Hotel construction should hold steady at its 2006 level while institutional building will advance 7 percent in dollar volume. Manufacturing construction will rise 14 percent, while public works building will grow 5 percent, it said, noting that new ethanol plants will feed some industrial growth, along with electric utilities construction.
