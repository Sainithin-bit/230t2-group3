 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Shrunken bottles of Tide and other liquid detergents could hit stores across the United States and Canada as early as next year should a test being conducted by Procter & Gamble Co. ( PG.N ) go well. 

 P&G just started selling concentrated bottles of liquid detergent in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, to judge consumer reaction to the bottles, which are smaller but clean the same amount of clothing, and cost as much as traditional bottles. The test, which includes concentrated versions of Tide, Gain, Cheer, Era and Dreft, comes weeks after Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ( WMT.N ) publicly called on suppliers to cut their waste. P&G's test also follows the roll-out of a concentrated detergent by rival Unilever Group ( ULVR.L ) ( UNc.AS ) earlier this year. P&G said the test is set to last six months. Should results in Cedar Rapids prove positive, P&G plans to convert its entire liquid laundry detergent lineup in the United States and Canada to the new packaging starting in 2007, the Cincinnati-based company said in a statement. A bottle of the new concentrated detergent washes the same amount of clothing as a bottle of normal detergent but are about half of the size. The new bottles are made with up to 47 percent less plastic and have up to 45 percent less water than before, P&G said. The move comes more than two years after consumer packaged goods companies such as P&G began to feel pressure from higher raw materials costs, particularly for the plastic used in packaging. Some of those costs have started to abate now that oil prices have fallen. Wal-Mart, the world's largest retailer, has indicated that decisions on which suppliers to use could partly hinge on compliance with its new plan, which calls for suppliers to cut the amount of packaging they use by 5 percent under a five-year plan scheduled to begin in 2008. "This was more of a Wal-Mart mandate than a PG-led initiative, but if the changeover goes smoothly, PG, the retailer and consumer win," Deutsche Bank said in a note to its clients this week. The plan was already announced to local retailers, but P&G did not widely distribute the details. Brandweek, a marketing industry publication, disclosed the plan on October 16. P&G's decision follows a move by Unilever to push its new "all Small & Mighty" product," a 32-ounce bottle of detergent that uses less than half the plastic of a 100-ounce container and cleans just as much.
