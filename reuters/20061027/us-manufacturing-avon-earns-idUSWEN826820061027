 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Avon Products Inc. ( AVP.N ), the world's largest direct seller of cosmetics, on Friday posted a 47 percent drop in third-quarter profit due to charges and said it would take more steps trim costs. 

 The company, which said its restructuring is on track, outlined two additional cost-cutting moves -- reducing the number of products it sells by 25 to 40 percent and moving toward global purchasing. Those changes come almost a year after efforts like job cuts and increased advertising spending were first laid out. "We continue to believe that the company's turnaround will take a while and is not imminent," said Goldman Sachs analyst Amy Low Chasen, who rates Avon "neutral." While the new plans are "encouraging for the long term," they could lead to even higher near-term charges, she said. Avon shares fell 3.5 percent before rebounding slightly. Earnings fell to $86.4 million, or 19 cents per share, from $163.8 million, or 35 cents per share, a year earlier. Avon resolved a long-standing tax dispute in the United Kingdom, which led to a charge of $21 million in the quarter. Excluding that and another charge for inventory reductions, Avon earned 27 cents per share, topping Wall Street's average forecast of 24 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. Operating profit fell 32 percent to $168 million. Revenue rose 9 percent to $2.06 billion, exceeding analysts' average forecast of $1.98 billion, driven by a 16 percent rise in skin care sales and the acquisition of a licensee in Colombia in late 2005. "Bulls can point to a revenue beat on previous low expectations and heavy advertising spending," said Bear Stearns analyst Justin Hott, who has a "peer perform" rating on Avon's shares. "Bears can point to that most key markets still look very bad, and only a few markets are driving growth." The company said its restructuring should yield nearly $100 million in savings this year. It still expects annualized savings of more than $300 million once the plan is fully implemented, with costs of about $500 million. NORTH AMERICA IS 'WORK IN PROGRESS' The number of active representatives who sell Avon products like Anew and Skin so Soft rose 6 percent, but grew just 2 to 3 percent without Colombia, Avon said. In North America, representative ranks continued to fall, though the 2 percent decline was softer than the 6 percent drop in the first half of 2006. North American revenue fell 1 percent, as low-income shoppers still felt pressure from higher gasoline prices, but to a lesser degree than in the first half of the year. Operating profit plunged 70 percent. "North America remains a work in progress," said Credit Suisse analyst Filippe Goossens, who rates the shares "outperform." Latin America, Avon's largest region, was the leading market with 28 percent revenue growth, aided by the Colombia deal. New York-based Avon has been cutting jobs and boosting advertising to lure back lower-income consumers who curbed purchases or defected to competitors' new skin-care products. Avon now plans to spend about $250 million on advertising this year, up from $135.9 million in 2005. Quarterly advertising nearly doubled to $66 million as the company promoted new products and the return of direct selling in China. The company sells its cosmetics and skin care products through representatives, rather than retailers. But China closed the door on direct sales in 1998; Avon just got approval to resume direct selling earlier this year. That change pushed quarterly revenue in China up 9 percent although Avon posted an operating loss of $3 million there. More than 236,000 people had registered with the Chinese government by the end of the quarter for the right to sell Avon products and the company said they were being trained. Morgan Stanley analyst Bill Pecoriello, who had expected sales growth of 40 percent or more in China, said the results suggest that productivity of the representatives is very low. Shares of Avon were down 77 cents at $29.29 in late morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The shares have risen just 2.5 percent so far this year, far below the 11 percent rise of the Standard & Poor's 500 index  .SPX , of which Avon it a member.
