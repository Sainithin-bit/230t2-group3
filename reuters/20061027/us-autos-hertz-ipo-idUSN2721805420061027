 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Car rental company Hertz Global Holdings Inc. on Friday said it will issue 88.2 million shares of common stock in a planned initial public offering for an estimated price of between $16 and $18 per share. 

 The underwriters will also have the option to buy another 13 million shares from selling shareholders in the event the IPO is oversubscribed, according to an amended offering document filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
