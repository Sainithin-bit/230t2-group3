 WUHAN, China  (Reuters) - French retailer Carrefour ( CARR.PA ) is not interested in making a major acquisition in China in response to Wal-Mart's ( WMT.N ) reported expansion plans, the retailer's chief executive said on Friday. 

 Carrefour could lose its top spot as China's largest foreign retailer if U.S. giant Wal-Mart succeeds in buying Trust-Mart, which owns 100 supercentres in China. A source familiar with the situation told Reuters about the plan earlier this month, but Wal-Mart has declined to comment. "We asked ourselves should we keep the emphasis on organic growth or take the risk of doing a large acquisition with all the problems and challenges of integration," Chief Executive Officer Jose Luis Duran said. "We are more interested in organic growth, and we will not deviate from that." Duran was speaking to a small group of reporters during a business visit to China with French President Jacques Chirac. Sources have said Wal-Mart is planning to buy Taiwan's Trust-Mart for $1 billion, which would more than double its presence in the world's most populous country. Carrefour aims to open at least 20 hypermarkets, which sell food along with household items such as fridges and TVs, in China this year and beyond. It will open its 84th hypermarket on Saturday, which is its 7th in Beijing and 1,000th in the world. Duran said Carrefour had looked at buying Trust-Mart but that the company did not meet its criteria. TOUGH FRENCH FOURTH QUARTER Carrefour, the world's second-largest retailer after Wal-Mart, was facing a difficult fourth quarter in France compared with the first nine months of this year, Duran said, but reaffirmed the financial targets for the group. "The (French) market remains tough," he said. "I think the last quarter will be hard. Why? Because there is tough price competition." Carrefour shares fell 1.8 percent to 49.53 euros by 0749 GMT in Paris, underperforming a little changed DJ retail index .SXRP. Some analysts were puzzled by the share reaction. "Carrefour has consistently been taking a very cautious tone about this year," a London-based analyst said. "They already warned of two fewer Saturdays this quarter and continued fierce competition from (privately held) Intermarche and Leclerc." Over the past quarters Carrefour's performance in France, where it earns about half of its sales, showed a recovery following price cuts and promotions to win back shoppers, mainly to its key hypermarket stores, amid mounting competition. Apart from a negative calandar effect -- fewer shopping days -- a 15 percent drop in petrol prices compared with the year-ago period would dampen sales growth this last quarter, Duran said. Carrefour expects sales growth at constant exchange rates this year to exceed the 4.3 percent growth last year and that profitability growth will lag sales growth. It has forecast current operating profit and sales growth of about 10 percent by 2008. INDIA Market saturation and slowing growth at home is also drawing foreign retailers to India with its 1.1 billion population. But its government bars foreign retailers from directly investing in India forcing them to team up with local retailers. "In India there are at least a good half a dozen candidates (for Carrefour to team up with)," Duran said, declining comment on negotiations with local retailers. Indian conglomerate Bharti Enterprises Ltd confirmed talks were with Carrefour, Wal-Mart, and Britain's Tesco ( TSCO.L ) and aims to pick a partner by the end of November. Carrefour is also in talks with Dubai's Landmark Group about opening up to 200 stores in India, Landmark Chief Executive Micky Jagtiani said earlier this month. Landmark's India unit is Lifestyle International Pvt. Ltd.
