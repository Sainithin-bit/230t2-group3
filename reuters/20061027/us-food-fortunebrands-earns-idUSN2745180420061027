 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Fortune Brands Inc. FO.N, whose products range from Jim Beam bourbon to Moen faucets, on Friday reported quarterly profit below Wall Street estimates but affirmed its full-year outlook of double-digit earnings growth, sending its shares up slightly. 

 Fortune, which also sells golf equipment and kitchen cabinets, said net profit for the third quarter rose to $151.3 million, or 98 cents a share, from $92.2 million, or 61 cents a share, a year ago, helped by acquisitions and a lower tax rate. Excluding special items, Fortune earned $1.30 a share from continuing operations, missing analysts' average estimate of $1.33 a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Analysts' expectations ranged from $1.28 a share to $1.41 a share. Excluding items in both quarters, Fortune said profit in the quarter grew 16 percent, in line with its stated target of double-digit growth. "Each of our three businesses performed in line with what we expected," said Chief Executive Norm Wesley on a conference call, "even as weakening new home construction impacted sales of windows and doors." Total net sales rose 23 percent to $2.22 billion, driven by a 46 percent increase in wine and spirits sales. Sales of home and hardware goods rose 18 percent, while golf product sales rose 7 percent. "Even though there was pressure on (the home and hardware) side of the business it held up nicely," said Donald Gher, chief investment officer for Coldstream Capital Management, which counts Fortune Brands stock among its $1 billion in holdings. "That was a nice surprise." Gher said the two negatives in the quarter were that earnings were boosted by a lower tax rate, and operating profit in the spirits segment, which grew 65 percent before charges, was a little below his expectations. Fortune, whose acquisition last year of more than 20 spirits brands places it among the world's top spirits companies, said quarterly sales of its Courvoisier cognac and Canadian Club whiskey were hurt by changes in distribution. The company said it would spend more next year to market the brands, but that would not impact earnings. In the home segment, Gher guessed that investors were anticipating sales gains below the 18 percent increase Fortune posted. He said that segment, which includes Simonton windows, MasterBrand cabinets, and Moen faucets, benefits from a focus on replacement and remodeling products, which do not suffer as much from a slowdown in the building of homes. Fortune affirmed its full-year earnings target and said it expects fourth-quarter earnings per share to grow at a high-single-digit to low-double-digit rate, excluding items. "While we expect the softening housing environment will create challenging comparisons for our home products brands through the first half of 2007, we believe that we will continue to outperform the broader home products market," said Chief Executive Norm Wesley. On a conference call with analysts, Wesley forecast that the housing downturn was likely to be steeper but shorter in duration than many have anticipated. "We see the likelihood of a fairly rapid recovery in the housing market in the second half of 2007," Wesley said, assuming interest rates do not rise and consumers stay resilient. He said the company's strategy was based on that timeline, but assured analysts that contingency plans were in place should he be wrong. "If we're wrong and sales are slower than we think, than we have already built into our expenses contingency that predicates that," Wesley said. "We'll deal with what we're dealt and work very hard to outperform the market." Shares of Fortune, which also owns Sauza tequila and Maker's Mark bourbon, fell 10 cents to $76.78 on Friday on the New York Stock Exchange, bringing them slightly below where they started the year. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index is up nearly 11 percent over the same period, whereas the S&P 1500 Household Durables Industry Index .15GSPHHD is down about 12 percent.
