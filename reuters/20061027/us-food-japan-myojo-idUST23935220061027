 TOKYO  (Reuters) - U.S. investment fund Steel Partners launched a $194 million tender offer for Japanese instant-noodle maker Myojo Foods Co. Ltd. on Friday, the second unsolicited bid for a Japanese company by a U.S. investor this month. 

 Shares in Myojo were flooded with buy orders and ended untraded at 709 yen, 16 percent above Thursday's close. Myojo executives said they were examining Steel Partners' offer but had not decided whether to endorse it. Once unheard of in Japan, hostile takeover bids are becoming less rare, although so far no major deal has succeeded. In September Oji Paper Co. dropped its landmark bid for smaller rival Hokuetsu Paper Mills Ltd., the first hostile buyout battle between blue-chip manufacturers. Steel Partners, which pioneered hostile bids in Japan with two failed attempts in 2004, is offering to buy the 76.9 percent of Myojo that it does not already own for 700 yen per share, a 14.9 percent premium to Myojo's closing price on Thursday. The offer values the entire company at 29.8 billion yen ($251.8 million). By bidding Myojo's shares higher than the tender price, some investors appeared to be hoping that Steel Partners would sweeten its offer. Last week, managers of machinery leasing firm Suntelephone Co. Ltd. declared their opposition to a $26 million tender bid from Dalton Investments LLC, another activist U.S. investor. Steel Partners had earlier proposed to bankroll a management buyout (MBO) by Myojo President Hironobu Nagano and other executives, but the executives declined. If they oppose the tender offer as well, Steel Partners would be forced to decide whether to continue with a potentially disruptive hostile takeover attempt. "We believe our offer is attractive because it provides Myojo's existing shareholders with liquidity and an opportunity to sell at a significant premium to the current market price," Steel Partners Chairman Warren Lichtenstein said in a statement. Steel Partners said it is happy with the performance of Myojo's managers and hopes to keep them in place after buying the firm, though mending relations if they oppose the tender could be difficult. The 22.9 billion yen ($193.5 million) offer will close on November 27. Myojo, which is Japan's fourth-ranked maker of instant ramen noodles, estimates a group recurring profit of 1.76 billion yen for the 12 months ended September 30, up from 1.24 billion yen the previous year.
