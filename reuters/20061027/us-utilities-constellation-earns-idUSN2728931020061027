 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Power company Constellation Energy Group Inc. CEG.N, which called off its $12.5 billion merger with FPL Group Inc. FPL.N earlier this week, on Friday posted higher third-quarter earnings on the strength of its merchant energy business. 

 The company exceeded its own forecast for the quarter by nearly 30 cents at the merchant business, which sells power at competitive prices into the open market. Constellation, which also boosted its full-year earnings targets, said net income rose to $324.4 million, or $1.79 per share, from $185.5 million, or $1.03 per share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, the company said it earned $1.56 a share. Analysts had expected earnings of $1.28 a share on average, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue rose 10.4 percent to $5.43 billion. Baltimore-based Constellation raised its 2006 earnings targets to a range of $3.65 to $3.80 per share from $3.35 to $3.65. This excludes the High Desert Plant, which will be treated as a discontinued operation to reflect its upcoming sale. Excluding special charges, the company expects to earn $3.30 to $3.45 per share for 2006. Constellation reaffirmed its outlook for 2007 and 2008. The company expects to earn between $4.40 to $4.65 per share in 2007, excluding dilution associated with applying the proceeds of the gas-fired generation plant sale to reduce debt. Excluding special charges, it is forecasting earnings per share of $4.30 to $4.65 next year. For 2008, it reaffirmed its outlook of $5.25 to $5.75 per share. (Additional Reporting by Michael Erman)
