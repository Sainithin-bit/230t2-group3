 TORONTO  (Reuters) - BlackBerry maker Research In Motion Ltd. RIM.TORIMM.O has received an informal inquiry from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in relation to its internal review of stock-option grants, the company said late on Friday. 

 RIM said that aside from the letter from the SEC, it has also been in communication with the Ontario Securities Commission, Canada's main securities regulator, in relation to the voluntary review, which it first announced late last month. Waterloo, Ontario-based RIM is the latest of a growing number of companies to be queried by U.S. authorities over option grants. A number of those companies have also launched their own inquiries into whether they manipulated the grant date of options to benefit executives who received them. Some of the cases involve backdating, in which companies boosted the value of stock options given to employees by setting their grant dates to coincide with a previous low point in the value of the underlying stock. Criminal charges have been laid against some company officials, including former executives of Brocade Communications Systems Inc. ( BRCD.O ) RIM also said on Friday it expects to file its financial statements for the second quarter of fiscal 2007 as soon as possible. The company repeated that it would need to restate its historical results, but added it does not expect a material adjustment to the preliminary second-quarter operating results reported on September 28. RIM said that it plans to provide bi-weekly updates on its affairs until it is current with its filing obligations under Canadian securities laws.
