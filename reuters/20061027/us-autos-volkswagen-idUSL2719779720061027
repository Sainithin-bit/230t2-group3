 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Volkswagen ( VOWG.DE ), the world's fourth-largest carmaker, beat expectations by nearly doubling third-quarter operating profit before special items, and reaffirmed its forecast for a full-year increase on Friday. 

 Helped by ongoing efforts to cut costs and slash jobs in its troubled VW brand operations, group operating profit increased to 991 million euros ($1.25 billion) excluding 668 million euros in one-off charges mainly to top up its pension fund. A Reuters poll had forecast on average 906 million euros before special items and 311 million for operating profit after items versus VW's reported figure of 323 million. "Although we have made significant progress in improving our competitiveness, we are still not satisfied with what we have achieved," Chief Financial Officer Hans Dieter Poetsch said. "This is the year in which we set the course for the future and the long-term success of our company. Our goal is clear: We want to generate profit before tax of 5.1 billion euros in 2008," he added in a statement. Following Thursday's profit warning by rival French carmaker PSA ( PEUP.PA ), Volkswagen stuck to its forecast for a full-year increase in pre-exceptional operating profit and a positive net cash flow at its core automotive business. After pulling in an average of 1 billion in operating profit per quarter, VW now needs to add only a further 124 million euros in the final three months of this year to reach its goal. "Restructuring is well on track. This was an unspectacular good quarter," said Patrick Juchemich, analyst at Sal. Oppenheim. Volkswagen said third quarter revenue rose 7.1 percent to 25.1 billion euros and deliveries also advanced 7.1 percent as it pushed new models like the Eos, Passat and Jetta cars. Earnings before tax, which include the non-consolidated results of the group's two key Chinese joint ventures, fell by half to 186 million euros. After tax, earnings plunged to 23 million euros. On a divisional basis the VW Brand Group before one-offs swung to an operating profit of 350 million euros from a loss of 54 million in the third quarter last year, while the Audi Brand Group grew profits by 46 percent to 437 million -- both easily beating the Reuters poll estimates. MASS CARMAKERS SUFFERING Separately, Volkswagen said it had filed plans with the German cartel office to raise its stake in German truckmaker MAN ( MANG.DE ) to more than 25 percent, sending VW stock lower. Volkswagen wants MAN and Sweden's Scania ( SCVb.ST ), in which VW holds 34 percent of its voting rights, to merge in a deal that would create the European truck market leader. High expectations for a restructuring success have priced shares in Volkswagen at a premium to its peers. The stock trades at 13.6 times next year's estimated earnings, according to Reuters Estimates. This compares to 13.0 times 2007 earnings for DaimlerChrysler DCXGn.DE and 8.1 times at Renault ( RENA.PA ). Volkswagen shares came off session lows to trade down 1.3 percent at 76.23 euros at 1011 GMT, underperforming a flat DJ Stoxx European automotive index .SXAP. Struggling to fully use their production capacity as demand remains sluggish, mass-market carmakers in both Europe and the United States have watched profit margins erode as high labor costs weigh and Asian competitors aggressively woo buyers. Among the top five carmakers by volume, only Toyota ( 7203.T ) is celebrating unmitigated success in the mass-market business thanks to its reputation for high quality, an attractive mix of fuel-efficient cars and a soft yen.
