 MINNEAPOLIS  (Reuters) - Minneapolis Federal Reserve President Gary Stern on Friday reiterated his support for the introduction of formal inflation targets by the U.S. central bank, a possible move that the Fed is expected to debate over the coming months. 

 "I am in favor of it," Stern said in a speech to the Missouri Valley Economic Association. Attainment of price stability should be the Fed's primary objective, he said, and inflation targets would help to do that more explicitly by institutionalizing current practice. Targets would reduce uncertainty about how policy-makers would respond to any given situation in the economy, and would improve accountability, Stern added. Expectations of future inflation would also be better "anchored" by inflation targets, contributing to sound private-sector decision making, he said. Stern did not speak about the current economy or monetary policy, two days after the FOMC voted to keep benchmark interest rates steady at 5.25 percent for a third consecutive meeting. Stern is not a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee in 2006. However, he is a member of a Fed task force, convened by Chairman Ben Bernanke, to examine a broad range of communications issues. The topic of formal inflation targets is expected to be one of the topics under review. The committee met for the first time this week. Fed Vice Chairman Donald Kohn chairs the committee, and  San Francisco Fed President Janet Yellen is also a member. Inflation outcomes in countries that have introduced formal targets "look quite promising," Stern said. Still, in response to a question from the audience, Stern said he doubted that Fed policy would have been "significantly different" over the last ten years had there been inflation targets. The Fed "has had success" on the inflation front, helping to create an "extended period of low inflation" since the mid-1990s.
