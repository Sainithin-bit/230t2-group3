 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. gross domestic product expanded at a 1.6 percent annual rate during the third quarter, down from 2.6 percent in the second quarter for the slowest advance since 1.2 percent in the first quarter of 2003. 

 Third-quarter GDP growth was well below Wall Street analysts' forecasts for a 2.2 percent rate of growth and reflected a range of influences that combined to slow the economy.   KEY POINTS: - A gauge favored by the Federal Reserve - personal spending excluding food and energy - increased at a 2.3 percent rate during the third quarter, slower than the 2.7 percent posted during the second quarter.  COMMENTARY:  RICHARD YAMARONE, CHIEF ECONOMIST, ARGUS RESEARCH, NEW YORK: "This is unsurprisingly weak. Housing took a toll on the economy but bear in mind this was last quarter, and the current quarter is on a growth pace that would double this number" because of consumer spending. "Housing took the biggest toll last quarter" but it's unlikely to worsen this quarter given recent data, he said.  MARKET REACTION: - U.S. Treasury debt prices extend gains after weaker-than-expected U.S. advance Q3 GDP. 
- Dollar falls after U.S. Q3 GDP data comes in below expectations. 
- U.S. stock index futures extend fall after Q3 GDP data. 
- U.S. rate futures up, tilt toward early-2007 Fed rate cuts on Q3 GDP data.
