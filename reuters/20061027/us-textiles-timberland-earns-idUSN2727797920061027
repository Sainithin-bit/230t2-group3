 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Timberland Co. on Friday TBL.N posted a 25 percent drop in quarterly profit, hurt by lower sales of its work boots and children's shoes, and said full-year earnings would fall further than expected. 

 The Stratham, New Hampshire-based company, whose shares fell about 1 percent in early trading, said third-quarter net income slid to $51.9 million, or 82 cents a share, from $69.2 million, or $1.02 per share, a year earlier. Analysts on average had expected earnings of 75 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Third-quarter revenue dipped to $503 million from $505.9 million, hurt by declines in boots and kids' shoes. The company's sales have suffered as its signature work boots have fallen out of fashion with the mostly young, urban consumers who once embraced them. Timberland forecast fourth-quarter revenue growth in the mid-single digit percentage range, reflecting "relatively flat" U.S. growth and double-digit gains in its international business. For the full year, the company is now expecting earnings per share to show a decline in the 30 percent range. In July, it forecast a drop of about 25 percent. Last year's earnings were $2.35 per share, excluding restructuring costs and other one-time items. Analysts on average were expecting profit of $1.74 per share for this year, according to Reuters Estimates. That would reflect about a 26 percent decline. Timberland said it expected continued pressure on operating profit through the first half of 2007, but forecast revenue and earnings gains for the second half of the year. Full-year earnings per share will probably be flat with 2006. The stock was off 33 cents, or 1.1 percent, at $28.60 on the New York Stock Exchange. At Thursday's close, the shares were down about 11 percent year today. The stock traded at about 14.5 times analysts' profit forecasts for next year, compared with 24.5 times for trendy shoe company Crocs Inc. ( CROX.O ) and 20.3 times for Skechers USA Inc. ( SKX.N ).
