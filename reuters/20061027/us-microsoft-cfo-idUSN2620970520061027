 SEATTLE  (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp.'s ( MSFT.O ) recent undersubscribed tender offer shaved 4 cents off its earnings per share outlook for the full fiscal year ending June 2007, Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Chris Liddell said on Thursday. 

 The company's previous guidance had not included the effect of the undersubscribed tender offer. Liddell said the software giant plans to make up the 4-cent per share shortfall with better performance and additional buybacks. He also said Microsoft is "confident" it can meet its target to ship 10 million Xbox 360 video game consoles by the end of 2006 and that it expects the cost of the next-generation video game player to decline in the current quarter.
