 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Auto parts maker BorgWarner Inc. ( BWA.N ) on Friday said quarterly earnings fell 36 percent as vehicle production cuts by Detroit-based automakers hurt results, pushing the company's shares down 3 percent. 

 Cuts in North American production of light trucks and sport utility vehicles made the quarter especially challenging, said the company, which makes products such as turbochargers, clutch systems, engine timing devices and traction controls. BorgWarner and other U.S. parts suppliers had warned that output cuts at General Motors Corp. ( GM.N ), Ford Motor Co. ( F.N ) and DaimlerChrysler AG's DCX.N DCXGn.DE Chrysler Group would hurt results in the 2006 second half. The company also said it expects net new business of $1.7 billion in the three-year period from 2007 through 2009, up from a projected $1.6 billion in 2006 through 2008. About 12 percent is seen coming in North America from the Big Three automakers. "As expected, it was tough quarter, but the growth in the international operations and expected backlog is encouraging," Morningstar analyst John Novak said. "BorgWarner should be able to manage through this industry downturn and looks to be well-positioned for the long-term." Net income fell to $39.2 million, or 68 cents per share, in the third quarter, from $61.4 million, or $1.07 per share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 1 percent to $1.06 billion. Excluding one-time charges, BorgWarner earned 77 cents per share. On that basis, analysts, on average, expected 86 cents per share, on revenue of $1.1 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. Sales rose 5 percent in its engine group segment to $736.4 million, but segment earnings fell 19 percent to $76.1 million due to pressure from higher costs for raw materials, mainly nickel, and lost U.S. sales. Sales fell 8 percent in the drivetrain group to $330.1 million and segment earnings fell 45 percent to $13.2 million. 'DIFFICULT QUARTER' "We had a difficult quarter, but our fundamental growth drivers remain strong," Chief Executive Timothy Manganello said in a conference call with analysts. "No one here at BorgWarner is satisfied with our third-quarter financial performance." BorgWarner expects $530 million of net new business in 2007, $530 million in 2008 and $640 million in 2009. Europe accounts for 46 percent of the new business; Asia for about 27 percent, with the bulk in that region in Korea and China; and North America for about 27 percent, including transplant and domestic automakers, BorgWarner said. About 73 percent of the business is in engine-related products such as turbochargers, ignition systems, emissions products and engine timing systems, it said. The rest is in transmission modules and all-wheel drive systems. In September, BorgWarner said it would cut about 850 jobs, or 13 percent of its North American work force, and lowered its 2006 earnings forecast because of the production slump. On Friday, BorgWarner stood by that full-year earnings forecast of $3.95 to $4.10 per share, excluding 15 cents per share of restructuring charges. Analysts expect $4.03. Shares of BorgWarner were down $1.81, or 2.95 percent, at $59.50 Friday at midmorning on the New York Stock Exchange.
