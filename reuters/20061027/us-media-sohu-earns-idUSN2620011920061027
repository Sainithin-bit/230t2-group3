 LOS ANGELES/HONG KONG  (Reuters) - Chinese Internet media firm Sohu.com ( SOHU.O ) delivered a stronger-than-expected 6 percent rise in underlying quarterly profit and an upbeat outlook on strong advertising sales, sending its shares sharply higher. 

 Total advertising revenue for Sohu.com Inc. jumped 27 percent from a year earlier to $23.9 million in the third quarter, driven by heavy spending from automobile and information industries. "The brand advertising business will continue to do well, and also in the third-quarter they did better than their guidance and the consensus number as well, so it is quite positive," said Dick Wei, an analyst at JP Morgan. Company officials were upbeat about the outlook for the firm, which was named last year as official Internet content sponsor for the Beijing 2008 Olympics. "We are now able to offer our advertising in a much broader range of products and inventory. That is a more important revenue growth driver," chief financial officer Carol Yu said, adding that advertising prices were rising. Sohu's third-quarter net income rose to $8.54 million, or 22 cents per diluted share, from $8 million a year earlier, or 21 cents per share, the Beijing-based company said, excluding expenses related to stock options. The company said it expected fourth-quarter earnings of 20 cents to 22 cents per share, excluding expenses related to employee stock options. Including the expenses, third-quarter net income fell nearly 18 percent to $6.6 million, or 17 cents per diluted share. Third-quarter revenue stood at a record $35.4 million and it forecast fourth-quarter revenue to hold steady at $34 million to $36 million, despite the fee and subscription changes imposed by the country's two mobile carriers which hurt its mobile services revenue. Analysts had been looking for fourth quarter guidance of between $32.2 million and $35.9 million, according to Reuters Estimates. Shares in the NASDAQ-listed company rose 6.3 percent to $22.54 and then added a further 4 percent to $23.51 in after-hours trade. ADVERTISING BUSINESS In July, the parents of listed China Mobile Ltd. ( 0941.HK ) ( CHL.N ) and China Unicom Ltd. ( 0762.HK ) ( CHU.N ) unveiled a spate of fee and subscription policy changes that analysts had expected would hurt new subscriber growth. However, Sohu said its wireless revenue only fell a marginal 2 percent in the third quarter from the previous quarter and rose 31 percent from a year earlier to $8.8 million. "Being able to achieve this is due to our vigilance in managing the wireless business and minimizing the risks of uncertainty and identifying new revenue sources," chairman and chief executive Charles Zhang said. Sohu, along with rivals Sina Corp. and NetEase.com Inc. ( NTES.O ), has been working to diversify revenues for the past two years as the market for their core wireless services has matured and mobile carriers squeeze commission rates. Now, Sohu hopes especially to rev up advertising ahead of the Beijing 2008 Olympics. Sohu continues to expand its online video content portfolio with new channels and exclusive content. It recently launched two new online TV-like channels, one for entertainment and the other for sport. It plans to launch an Olympic channel in early November, Zhang added.
