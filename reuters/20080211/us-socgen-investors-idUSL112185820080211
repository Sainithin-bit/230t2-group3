 LONDON  (Reuters) - Institutional investors said on Monday they expect to subscribe to new shares in Societe Generale ( SOGN.PA ) given the deep discount and the potential upside if the French bank receives a takeover offer. 

 Shares in SocGen fell as much as 6.3 percent on Monday to 72.83 euros as it announced a one-for-four rights issue at 47.50 euros, a 39 percent discount to Friday's closing price. "I think we will subscribe to the shares," said Chief Investment Officer Regis Longlade at Paris-based Prado Epargne Gest. "As a shareholder, we don't want to be diluted. And we see this as an opportunity for us to buy shares. Societe Generale will probably be bought by another bank, that's why we will subscribe." France's second-biggest bank will issue 116.65 million shares, or 25 percent of its existing share capital, to shore up its capital base. Any bidder would benefit from a well-funded bank with a tier one ratio of above 8 percent. Domestic rivals BNP Paribas ( BNPP.PA ) and Credit Agricole ( CAGR.PA ), Spain's BBVA ( BBVA.MC ) and Italy's Unicredit ( CRDI.MI ) are among potential suitors, fund managers said. SocGen's shareholding remains diversified, with the top five investors holding only 22.5 percent of the bank. At 74.03 euros per share at 1551 GMT, SocGen traded at 6.6 times its 2009 earnings-per-share estimate of about 11.20 euros a share, in-line with BNP's price-to-earnings multiple of 6.2 times. SocGen said the rights would have a theoretical value of 5.86 euros after an estimated dividend of 0.9 euros, based on a payout of 45 percent against 2007 earnings. The new shares will not be entitled to a dividend. PSYCHOLOGICAL IMPACT "We believe the psychological signal is not positive as this discount is higher than the 20 to 30 percent range expected," said Deutsche Bank analyst Brice Vandamme. A London-based fund manager said he could not understand why SocGen was offering new shares at such a big discount because most shareholders would subscribe anyway. "Given the level of discount, you've got to question why the issue needs to be underwritten by Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ) and JPMorgan ( JPM.N ) in the first place," the fund manager said. For existing shareholders, the total amount of their investment in SocGen would be the same, irrespective of the subscription discount, but the move indicated SocGen's anxiety in executing the deal, the fund manager added. Some fund managers are taking a wait-and-see stance. "The discount rate is not important for us," said Aymeric Schmerber, a fund manager at Paris-based BDF Gestion, which holds SocGen shares. "But we need more time to see how the market moves forward. I think we will take the decision at the last moment." SocGen's own investment bank, Credit Suisse ( CSGN.VX ), and Merrill Lynch MER.N are the other bookrunners of the deal. The offer, the world's third-biggest rights issue, will run from February 21 to February 29. According to Thomson Financial, Fortis Bank's FORTS.IS $19.3 billion rights issue and the $8.8 billion rights issue of Russia's Sberbank ( SBER.RTS ) are the top two issues so far.
