 PARIS  (Reuters) - French bank BNP Paribas ( BNPP.PA ) is not preparing a hostile takeover bid for embattled rival Societe Generale ( SOGN.PA ) but could be interested in a friendly deal, a source familiar with the bank's thinking said on Monday. 

 A French financial newsletter report on Monday that BNP was preparing a 93-euros-a-share offer for SocGen was "total rubbish", the source said. "The idea of a bid has not been raised at all at board level," the source said. "What one could think about is a friendly approach. If at a certain stage Societe Generale management considers it intelligent to bolster the bank with a natural partner there could be something to do." (Reporting by Yann Le Guernigou)
