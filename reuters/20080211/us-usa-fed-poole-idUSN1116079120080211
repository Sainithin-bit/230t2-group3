 ST. LOUIS  (Reuters) - The U.S. appears likely to avoid an economic slowdown, and Federal Reserve interest rate targets are well-positioned to stabilize the economy, St. Louis Fed Bank President William Poole said on Monday. 

 "I think the best bet is that we will not have a recession," he said in response to questions after a speech to the St. Louis chapter of the National Association for Business Economics. "Policy is at a good place both for the long-run concern and for cushioning the impact of the financial disturbances we are now dealing with," he added. Poole, who is retiring in March and will not attend the next scheduled interest rate policy meeting on March 18, said inflation expectations have remained steady. "So far we're standing with very sticky shoes on that slippery slope," he said. "We do watch it very closely; there's no question that there's a risk." The Fed cut interest rates by 1.25 percentage points to 3 percent last month to prevent the economy from sliding into recession as the bursting of the housing bubble and a tightening of credit had begun to dampen hiring and cool consumer and business spending. Even as the economy has slowed, inflation has risen since the summer to levels above the comfort zone of some policy-makers. In his prepared speech, Poole said efforts to provide forward guidance on the likely direction of interest-rate policy often can sow more confusion than clarity. "I have concluded that an ... attempt to provide forward guidance in the policy statement causes more communications difficulties than it solves," Poole said. "A key reason is that the economy is subject to more shocks and reversals than one might think." The St. Louis Fed president said he questions the effectiveness of trying to provide guidance about future central bank moves because the economy is subject to many shocks and reversals. Those shocks require the central bank to change interest rates more frequently that he would have thought likely before he arrived at the regional Fed bank 10 years ago, he said. Furthermore, language about direction tends to take on a life of its own, Poole said. When the Fed talks about likely future directions of monetary policy in its statements, that language tends to remain in Fed statements beyond the time it applies, while removing it runs the risk of miscommunication, Poole said. "Every change in the policy statement naturally leads to market questions as to what the change means and whether the change is meant to provide a hint about the future direction of policy," he said.
