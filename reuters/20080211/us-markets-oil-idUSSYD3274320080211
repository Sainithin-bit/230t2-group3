 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Oil prices jumped nearly two percent to their highest levels in a month after Venezuela threatened to halt sales to the United States over an intensifying legal battle between the OPEC nation and Exxon Mobil Corp. 

 Venezuela is the fourth biggest supplier of crude to the United States, and energy analysts have said that any interruption to shipments could tighten up inventories and push prices higher. "While Chavez has not followed through on previous threats to stop U.S. oil supplies, his volatile personality and the uncertainty of his next action may continue to keep participants on edge," John Kilduff, senior vice president at MF Global, said in a research note. U.S. crude settled up $1.82 at $93.59 a barrel after trading as high as $94.72, the highest since January 10. London Brent settled up $1.59 at $93.53. Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez made the threat Sunday after Exxon Mobil won a court decision freezing $12 billion of Venezuela's overseas assets, stepping up its push for compensation for the nationalization of a heavy oil project. "If you freeze us, if you really manage to freeze us, if you damage us, then we will hurt you. Do you know how? We are not going to send oil to the United States, Mr. Bush, Mr. Danger," Chavez said on his weekly TV show. Chavez has frequently issued conditional threats to stop shipments to the United States amid clashes with the White House, but has never followed through with a halt. A U.S. State Department spokesman said Monday he expected Venezuela to respect international law. Additional support came from cold weather in the U.S. Northeast and a handful of refinery problems, which were expected to tighten up supplies of heating oil. Oil's gains come after a four percent rally Friday, the biggest gain in nearly two months, as production problems in the North Sea and Nigeria pushed aside fears that a U.S. recession would hurt fuel demand. Dealers said the rebound from last Thursday's low of $86.24 -- nearly the lowest in 3-1/2 months -- was aided by traders buying back short positions built up as the market fell from its January 3 record high of $100.09. Crude speculators on the New York Mercantile Exchange cut net long positions again last week, according to data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission released Friday.
