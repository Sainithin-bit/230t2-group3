 LONDON  (Reuters) - Stock index futures indicated a positive open on Wall Street on Monday in a thin day for earnings, while technology shares might grab attention as Yahoo ( YHOO.O ) was set to rebuff a takeover bid from Microsoft. 

 Also in the technology sector, Motorola Inc MOT.N and Nortel Networks Corp NT.TO are in talks to combine their wireless infrastructure units, the Wall Street Journal reported, quoting people familiar with the situation. By 5:45 a.m. EST, S&P 500 futures SPc1 and Dow futures DJc1 were both up 0.1 percent while Nasdaq futures NDc1 were little changed. Worries about a deeper global economic slowdown than expected hit equities, with Asian stocks .MIAPJ0000PUS down 2 percent and the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index  .FTEU3  0.2 percent lower. The S&P 500  .SPX  fell on Friday and the Dow Jones industrials  .DJI  ended its worst week in nearly five years, hit by losses in shares of financials, home builders and other sectors at the centre of the credit market crisis. Yahoo was set to reject Microsoft Corp's ( MSFT.O ) unsolicited bid, now worth $42 billion, as too low, a source familiar with the situation said on Saturday in the first clear signal that the board might be prepared to negotiate and sell the company. "They're going to reject the deal," said Jonathan Monk, a portfolio manager at Aerion Fund Management. "I can't see who else would be interested in doing a deal with them apart from Microsoft especially at this level. But presumably they will try to push the price higher." On the M&A front, Delta Air Lines Inc ( DAL.N ) and Northwest Airlines Corp NWA.N may reach a merger agreement within weeks after sharing details of their plans with pilot unions, according to a report on Bloomberg.com citing people familiar with the talks. Toy and game company Hasbro Inc HAS.N and conglomerate Loews Corp LTR.N are among the S&P 500 companies reporting earnings on Monday. Last week, the Dow lost 4.4 percent while the S&P fell 4.6 percent and the Nasdaq ended 4.5 percent lower. (Reporting by Anshuman Daga, additional reporting by Raissa Kasolowsky
