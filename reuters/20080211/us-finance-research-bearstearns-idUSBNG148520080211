 (Reuters) - Bear Stearns said it expects Standard & Poor's 500 financials to recognize mortgage and other credit-related write-downs of $125 billion to $175 billion, adding that write-downs in Europe should not cause "widespread panic" for U.S. counterparts. 

 Analyst Jonathan Golub expects total economic losses related to the U.S. mortgage market to range from $250 billion to $300 billion to be recognized by investors worldwide. "Our sense is that European financial institutions are well behind their U.S. counterparts in recognizing likely losses. We also believe that European analysts have been slower to downwardly revise their earnings estimates," Golub wrote in a note to clients. Financial institutions have been under pressure amid a slowing economy and the credit market turmoil. The seizing up of capital markets has led to more than $130 billion of write-downs worldwide, including S&P Financial index .GSPF components such as Citigroup, Bank of America and Washington Mutual. Golub said since the end of the third quarter, S&P Financials have lost $593 billion in market capitalization and earnings estimates have been downwardly revised by $138 billion to reflect a slower operating environment and need to build additional loss reserves. Companies within the financials sector have widely disappointed this earnings season, he added, with the S&P Financial index falling about 10 percent so far this year. Profit fell 34 percent at JPMorgan Chase & Co ( JPM.N ), 38 percent at Wells Fargo ( WFC.N ), 95 percent at Bank of America ( BAC.N ) and 98 percent at Wachovia WB.N. Citigroup ( C.N ), suffered a record $9.83 billion loss, while Washington Mutual ( WM.N ), the largest savings and loan, lost $1.87 billion.
