 LONDON  (Reuters) - Yahoo is seeking to restart merger talks with AOL as a means of defending itself against an unsolicited bid approach from Microsoft, the Times newspaper said on Monday. 

 The paper, without citing sources, said Yahoo was also considering tie-ups with groups such as Google and Disney. It said Yahoo and AOL had previously tried to join forces, but were unable to agree on the price of a deal. None of the parties mentioned could immediately be reached for comment.
