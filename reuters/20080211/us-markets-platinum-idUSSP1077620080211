 SINGAPORE  (Reuters) - Platinum hit another record high on Monday on the back of lingering supply concerns in South Africa, which produces four-fifths of the world's metal. 

 Spot platinum XPT= rose to $1,885/1,892 an ounce from $1,880/1,888 late in New York on Friday. South Africa has appealed to mining companies for help in cutting power consumption to ease a power crisis caused by the failure of electricity generation to match economic growth.
