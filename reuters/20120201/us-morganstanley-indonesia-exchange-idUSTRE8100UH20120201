 JAKARTA  (Reuters) - Indonesia's stock exchange has suspended trading on local firm PT Tiga Pilar Sekuritas pending approval of its plan to transfer its brokerage seat to Morgan Stanley M.S, a senior official at the exchange said on Wednesday. 
 "We have suspended the trading activities of Tiga Pilar today as we will process their transfer to a third party, which is Morgan Stanley," said Uriep Budi Prasetyo, director of compliance and supervision at the exchange, told Reuters. Morgan Stanley is finalizing a deal to buy a brokerage seat in Indonesia from PT Tiga Pilar Sekuritas to enable it to tap growing financial markets in Southeast Asia's biggest economy, Reuters reported earlier on Wednesday.
