 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - NYSE Euronext said on Wednesday that it would return $550 million to shareholders and seek to grow its derivatives business after EU antitrust regulators blocked its planned merger with Deutsche Boerse. 
 "NYSE Euronext announced its intent to resume a $550 million share repurchase program following the termination of the merger agreement and after the release of its fourth quarter and 2011 year-end results on February 10, 2012," the exchange operator said in a statement. (Reporting Foo Yun Chee)
