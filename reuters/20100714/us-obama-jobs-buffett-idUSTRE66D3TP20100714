 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama discussed his efforts to stimulate the economy and create jobs with billionaire U.S. investor Warren Buffett in an Oval Office meeting on Wednesday, a White House official said. 

 The White House held a series of events focused on job creation and the economy during the day, as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce issued a rebuke of Obama's economic agenda. The Chamber, a leading business group, accused Obama and his fellow Democrats in Congress of neglecting job creation and hampering growth with burdensome regulatory and tax policies. Four months before the November congressional elections in which Democrats are fighting to keep majorities in Congress, Republicans have tried to paint Obama and his fellow Democrats as anti-business. Buffett built an estimated $47 billion fortune running his insurance and investment company Berkshire Hathaway Inc ( BRKa.N ). "Today, the president met with Warren Buffett, one of the world's most well-respected business leaders, to discuss the economy and our ongoing efforts to work with the private sector to stimulate growth and create jobs," the official said.
