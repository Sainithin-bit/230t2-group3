 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Uncertainty about the U.S. economy is forcing Federal Reserve officials to multi-task. 

 Even as they discuss the possibility that renewed weakness in the outlook might create the need for a further easing of economic conditions, Fed policymakers at their late-June meeting also held a wide-ranging discussion of potential steps to withdraw monetary stimulus. One prominent such measure, according to minutes of the Fed's June meeting released on Wednesday, is the possible sale of some of the Treasury and mortgage-related debt the Fed acquired in the course of battling the worst financial crisis in generations. In response to the sharp tightening in credit conditions during the crisis, the Fed bought more than $1.5 trillion of such bonds. Some hawkish regional Fed presidents have argued for moving to assets sales sooner rather than later, while members of the Fed board have indicated a more cautious approach. The minutes indicated there is still widespread concern about the possibility that dumping mortgage securities into a still-crippled market could precipitate another downturn in housing, crimping consumer spending and threatening the recovery itself. "Many participants still saw asset sales as potentially tightening financial conditions to some extent," the report said. "Most participants continued to judge it appropriate to defer asset sales for some time; several noted the modest weakening in the economic outlook since the (policy-setting) committee's last meeting as an additional reason to do so." There is broad agreement within the Fed that some day, down the line, the central bank would do best to shrink its balance sheet and return to holding primarily Treasuries, as it did before the crisis. Indeed, the minutes showed a few officials supported moving to sales "fairly soon." The minutes showed discomfort among some Fed officials about holding such a large quantity of mortgage-backed securities. A few officials suggested selling MBS and using the proceeds to buy Treasury bonds, arguing this would not tighten financial conditions overall. The Fed currently holds $1.12 trillion in MBS, $164.8 billion in debt issued by hobbled government-sponsored agencies like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and $777.0 billion in Treasury securities. There was also discussion at the June 22-23 meeting of how to manage the Fed's Treasury holdings. Currently, the Fed reinvests the proceeds of such bonds as they mature back into new Treasuries. But Brian Sack, head of the New York Fed's markets group, outlined possible changes to this approach at the meeting. These included halting all such reinvestments or reinvesting only in shorter maturities. No final decisions were made.
