 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Members of the Federal Reserve felt last month they should be ready to consider additional steps to boost the U.S. economy if an already softening economic outlook took a noticeable turn for the worse, a document released on Wednesday showed. 

 KEY POINTS: * "As a result of the change in financial conditions, most participants revised down slightly their outlook for economic growth," minutes of the Fed's June 22-23 meeting said. * "The committee would need to consider whether further policy stimulus might become appropriate if the outlook were to worsen appreciably," the Fed said. * At the same time, the Fed should continue to test ways to withdraw some of the massive amounts of credit it has pumped into the financial system, Fed officials agreed. COMMENTS: JACK ABLIN, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, HARRIS PRIVATE BANK, CHICAGO: "The statement is consistent with the cautious view. The fact is that fiscal stimulus is subsiding and we have to rely almost exclusively on the Federal Reserve at least for the near term until we can get that next catalyst for growth. In my view, jobs/employment has just been a disaster. It's a huge disappointment and I'm sure the Fed shares my concern. "Unless we hear just remarkable forecasts from company management this quarter I just think that this statement has thrown a wet blanket over earnings season." CHRIS DILLMAN, ANALYST, TRADITION ENERGY, STAMFORD, CONNECTICUT: "Crude futures turned negative after the release of the minutes of the most recent Fed meeting on the lower growth outlook. But I don't think the revisions are big enough to warrant a deeper decline here in crude futures. The FOMC minutes plus the earlier data on retail sales were not helpful to crude futures. But tomorrow's release of other economic reports, including jobless benefit claims, producer prices and industrial output may weigh on the market further as those reports may come in lower than expected." TOM SCHRADER, MANAGING DIRECTOR, U.S. EQUITY TRADING, STIFEL NICOLAUS CAPITAL MARKETS, BALTIMORE: "From an economic standpoint, (the minutes) were negative in nature because the Fed is fighting a slowing economy and deflationary pressures, and those pressures are harder to fight than inflationary pressures. Demand for the 10-year (in Treasuries) is testament to that fact that people are seeking safety." MICHAEL CUGGINO, PRESIDENT, PERMANENT PORTFOLIO FUNDS, SAN FRANCISCO: "Those numbers to me don't indicate enough of a move to freak anybody out...to me, absent other factors, this is just a profit-taking pause. "I don't believe we're going to hit a double dip...There is some underlying economic growth occurring. Those factors all bode well for continued, albeit slow, growth." PETER BOOCKVAR, EQUITY STRATEGIST, MILLER TABAK + CO IN NEW YORK: "Within the minutes of the June FOMC meeting where they reviewed the economic stats seen since the prior meeting, they believed looking forward that the recovery in economic activity would be moderate through 2011. "They did say that the pace of recovery will be 'somewhat slower than previously predicted' and they also reduced their expectations for both headline and core inflation slightly. Some members wanted to consider whether further policy stimulus might become appropriate if the outlook were to worsen appreciably. In terms of 'helping' the economy, I believe their gun is out of real bullets and all they got left is water. They have reached the law of diminishing returns and Fed impotence is a growing risk." MARC CHANDLER, GLOBAL HEAD OF CURRENCY STRATEGY AT BROWN BROTHERS HARRIMAN, NEW YORK: "The minutes from the recent FOMC meeting were not as dovish as some had expected and this seems to have encouraged some profit-taking on short dollar positions. "As widely expected the Fed cut inflation and growth forecasts, but the downgrades were not as severe as anticipated. While there was some talk of action if needed, but the discussion seems vague with no specific actions proposed and the bar as we suggested seems a bit high insofar as it would require 'appreciably worsening' of the outlook." The minutes are "not hawkish enough to reverse the negative sentiment toward the dollar and it is not dovish enough to heighten expectations for a resumption of credit easing." WAYNE KAUFMAN, CHIEF MARKET ANALYST, JOHN THOMAS FINANCIAL, NEW YORK: "Sounds like stuff we already knew. You probably could have guessed it before they said anything. Because it isn't surprising, I don't see much market impact from this. All anyone cares about right now is earnings and guidance. We're very overbought, and we got overbought at resistance levels, so it's natural to see a pullback. We just want to see it on low volume." RICHARD DEKASER, PRESIDENT, WOODLEY PARK RESEARCH, WASHINGTON: "Generally people have been knocking down their outlook so it's not surprising the Fed would follow after a string of disappointing numbers in the past four to six weeks. "On the whole the economy is soldiering along but with less strength than a few months ago. The Fed forecasts are being pulled in line with where the private sector has been heading for the past several months. "I think it's way too premature to renew unconventional policy measures like mortgage-backed securities purchase. "Also we had comments from the likes of (Richmond Fed President Jeffrey) Lacker indicating a rate decision is a long way off. This would push us well into 2011, but growth coming meaningful next year so the first rate hike won't be 2012." WARD MCCARTHY, CHIEF FINANCIAL ECONOMIST AT JEFFERIES & CO. IN NEW YORK: "The Fed was clearly less optimistic about the economy than it had been at the prior FOMC meeting. They lowered the projections for some key economic variables. "At this meeting they were starting to discuss some options that they may take if the economy were to appear to be headed for another recession. From what I've seen it suggests that rates are going to stay low for a long time and if necessary the Fed will try to conjure up some other ways to support the economy." HUGH JOHNSON, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, HUGH JOHNSON ADVISORS LLC, ALBANY, NY: "These minutes accurately reflect what went on in the economy in May and June, It's becoming increasingly clear, based on the housing numbers for May, the retail sales numbers for May and June, and the employment numbers that the economy has hit a soft patch. And that shows up in these minutes, which tells us that the economy 'softened somewhat.' "There is a clear bias toward less restraint. Or it is fairly clear that the Federal Reserve is not going to remove any accommodation anytime soon. Their comments will be good news for Treasuries and bad news for stocks, but not overwhelmingly surprising. It's interesting to see that some members of the open market committee see the risk of deflation. All of this is in line with expectations. But the bias is clearly toward less restraint, which is realistic. They ain't going to raise rates any time soon." STEVE GOLDMAN, MARKET STRATEGIST, WEEDEN & CO., GREENWICH, CONNECTICUT: "This should be a non-event for investors, expectations were already priced into stock prices. The revision suggests it's a slow recovery, but we're not in a double dip. "The markets caused the deceleration of the economy in the second half, the Fed's adjusting to that, because they left the forecasts of the following year intact." SAMARJIT SHANKAR, MANAGING DIRECTOR, GLOBAL FX STRATEGY, BNY MELLON, BOSTON: "In terms of interest rates there is not much room left so the main point is that there is divided opinion within the Fed about how aggressively they should act as the economy slows further. It is a frank admission that the labor market is stalling. The debate is leaning to alleviating the risk of deflation. And there are some elements within the Fed that are arguing for the renewing of selective purchase of bonds to ensure interest rates remain low. GDP growth forecasts are ratcheted lower, unemployment a little higher. They will not be averse to keeping interest rates low for an extended period." MARKET REACTION: STOCKS: U.S. stock indexes slipped modestly BONDS: U.S. Treasury debt prices were slightly stronger DOLLAR: U.S. dollar rose against the euro and yen
