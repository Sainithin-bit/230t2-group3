 DETROIT  (Reuters) - General Motors Corp's contract settlement with the United Auto Workers includes second-tier wages for new hires and signing bonuses in addition to the trust for retiree health care, Detroit's newspapers reported on Wednesday. 

 GM agreed to fund the retiree health-care trust, called a Voluntary Employees' Beneficiary Association, or VEBA, at nearly 70 cents on the dollar, the Detroit News said. The UAW and GM would not comment on the details of the tentative contract before it is presented to 73,000 GM workers for ratification. New hires who do not perform key manufacturing tasks would see wages drop in half from the $28 per hour that the average assembly worker receives now, the papers reported. Buyouts and early retirements could be offered to make room for new hires. Workers would receive $3,000 signing bonuses and lump-sum payments for the last three years of the four-year contract, but no wage increases. Workers also would forgo cost-of-living adjustments in exchange for no increase in medical premiums. GM also would make more than 4,000 temporary workers permanent at the lower rate, the Detroit News said. The controversial "jobs bank" that pays idled workers nearly full wages and benefits would remain, but workers would be required to take available jobs from a wider area than they are now.
