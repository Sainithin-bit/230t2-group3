 MT. LAUREL, New Jersey  (Reuters) - Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia President Charles Plosser said on Tuesday that the central bank already anticipates weaker economic growth in coming months and warned it would remain vigilant against inflation. 

 Speaking for the first time since the Fed cut its benchmark federal funds rate last week for the first time in four years, Plosser said: "It is important to understand that the economy is expected to grow more slowly in coming months, despite last week's decision to reduce rates. "Therefore, I will not be surprised to see weaker statistics making headlines," he said in a speech to the New Jersey Technology Council. The Fed cut its benchmark federal funds rate target by 50 basis points to 4.75 percent last week. Markets expect further rate cuts in the wake of a prolonged housing slump and recent financial turmoil. But when asked about such expectations, Plosser said future rate decisions would depend on if the Fed had to change its outlook on the economy or prices. He declined to say whether the risks to that outlook weighed more to the downside or to the upside, or how long it would take to change the outlook. "The news can be positive or negative. It would be an accumulation of the numbers," he told reporters after the speech. Data on consumer spending and the jobs market would be closely watched, as well as possible spillover from recent financial market turmoil and tighter credit conditions. While noting that financial market conditions have improved following a severe tightening that began last month, Plosser said the crisis was not yet over, citing lingering doubts about financial firms' exposure to bad mortgage loans. "The markets are struggling with that and there's still a lot of uncertainty," he said. "We don't know who's holding risk and how much of it there is." Credit conditions tightened globally since problems among financial institutions stemming from U.S. mortgage markets surfaced in mid-August. VIGILANT ON INFLATION Plosser said the Fed needed to remain vigilant on inflation, especially as reducing short-term interest rates raised the risk of higher inflation expectations. "While inflationary signs this summer have been encouraging, I do not think we are in a position to be sanguine," he said. "The inflation risk is still there. Oil is still very high. Wage growth is still very high. Liquidity is still very high. And expectations are still very high," he said. "If inflation begins to creep up or expectations of future inflation rise in the coming months -- which is a risk given our decision to cut rates -- the outlook will be affected and policy may have to be adjusted." Plosser, known as one of the more hawkish members among Fed policy-makers, will have his first vote on the Fed's rate-setting committee in 2008. The Philly Fed chief made the case for adopting an inflation target, especially under current conditions. Plosser has long advocated that the U.S. central bank adopt an explicit price target to stabilize inflation expectations. "Cutting the funds rate can aggravate inflation," he said. "If we had a goal and the public believed that goal, then the actions we took would have less risk that ... expectations would drift away." The bond market has already indicated a wariness about inflation as the Fed's surprisingly bold half-percentage-point cut in overnight rates sparked a steepening in the Treasury yield curve. It also prompted a widening in the spread between the yields on 10-year bonds and their inflation-protected counterparts, 10-year TIPS, by up to 10 basis points. The Fed has been discussing whether or not to adopt an explicit inflation goal as part of a review of its efforts to communicate its policy more clearly to the public. Speaking on the topic of "Invention, Productivity and the Economy", Plosser said he expected trend productivity growth will likely turn out to be only slightly below 2 percent. That in turn would mean trend growth over the next few years would likely be close to 2-3/4 percent, somewhat slower compared with more than 3 percent growth seen in the late 1990s. Lower productivity growth, or output per worker, over the long-run is worrisome for policy-makers as it could fan inflation through higher wage costs and dampen growth.
