 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Bonds of General Motors rose on Wednesday after the automaker reached a tentative deal to end a strike at GM, raising hopes that Detroit's automakers would soon slash their health-care costs. 

 GM's 8.375 percent bond due in 2033 rose 2.25 cents on the dollar on Wednesday to 89 cents, from 86.75 cents on Tuesday, according to MarketAxess. "It's a very positive step that they've come to an agreement," said Mirko Mikelic, portfolio manager and analyst for Fifth Third Asset Management in Grand Rapids, Michigan, as it signals the unions have realized they will have to help the automakers for them to stay globally competitive. The cost of protecting GM's debt with credit default swaps fell sharply. Five-year credit default swap spreads declined by 55 basis points to about 497 basis points, or $497,000 a year for five years to protect $10 million of debt. (Additional reporting by  Dena Aubin )
