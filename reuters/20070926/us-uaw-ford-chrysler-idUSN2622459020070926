 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co and Chrysler LLC could clinch cost-cutting labor deals with the United Auto Workers as soon as next week based on the ground-breaking agreement between the union and General Motors Corp reached on Wednesday, analysts said. 

 "We believe it is increasingly likely, based on the pattern set by GM's tentative deal, that Ford and Chrysler will reach a broadly similar agreement," said Robert Schulz, credit analyst with Standard & Poor's. GM reached a tentative four-year labor agreement with the UAW early on Wednesday morning, ending a two-day strike by the largest U.S. automaker's 73,000 workers. One person familiar with the negotiations said labor talks with Ford and Chrysler were likely to proceed on a parallel track and could resume as soon as Monday. The agreements at Ford and Chrysler are likely to be broadly based on the GM deal, including the establishment of a new UAW-aligned health care trust, the person said. Both Ford and Chrysler said they are ready to work with the UAW now that the GM labor talks are out of the way. "We are pleased they were able to reach an agreement," Ford spokeswoman Marcey Evans said. "We look forward to working with the UAW on finalizing a responsible agreement that meets the needs of our company, our employees and the UAW," Chrysler spokeswoman Michele Tinson said. Analysts said while Ford and Chrysler may conclude broadly similar agreements to GM's, there could be some changes. "Each company has distinct work force and retiree demographics that could result in differences in projected cash savings from the contracts," Schulz said. John Wolkonowicz, an analyst with Global Insight, said privately held Chrysler, which is now controlled by Cerberus Capital Management, could insist on a shorter contract term or other provisions that would speed Chrysler's reemergence as a public company. "For them, a four-year contract is like a million-year contract," he said. The UAW indefinitely extended its previous labor contracts at Ford and Chrysler on September 13 to focus on GM. UAW President Ron Gettelfinger said on Wednesday that he was ready to resume talks soon with the other two Detroit-based automakers. The UAW represents 49,000 Chrysler workers and 58,000 at Ford. "There is no reason ... at this point in time why we can't get both of those done at the same time," Gettelfinger said in an interview with WJR radio in Detroit. "If we run into difficulty at one or another, then we will make a decision; but I am hopeful." The GM agreement, which would shift a more than $50 billion obligation for retiree health care to the UAW, should provide the pattern for Ford and Chrysler deals, Gettelfinger said. "We expect that this will basically be the kind of agreement that we get at the other companies," he said. "There are some modifications at the others, but for the most part it will be a pattern agreement." The UAW contract talks are seen as crucial to efforts by the Big Three Detroit-based automakers to recover from combined losses of $15 billion last year and sales difficulties that have driven their share of the U.S. market below 50 percent. All three U.S.-based automakers are seeking concessions from the UAW to close a labor cost gap with Toyota Motor Corp and other Japanese automakers operating in the United States that they say amounts to more than $30 per hour for the average factory worker.
