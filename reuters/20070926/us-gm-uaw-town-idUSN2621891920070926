 LORDSTOWN, Ohio  (Reuters) - The relief was palpable on Wednesday as GM workers headed back to work after a two-day strike, but no one in this tiny Ohio town sounded very optimistic about the future. 

 David Green, president of the United Auto Workers local 1714, stood outside the union hall not far from GM's massive car plant in Lordstown, Ohio, shaking hands with co-workers as news spread that a deal had been reached to end the strike. "People seem to be relieved, excited to get back to work," Green said. "There is still some concern, we don't have all of the details yet, so we'll wait and see." Some 3,000 workers still face an uncertain future in Lordstown, where production of the Chevy Cobalt and Pontiac G5 is due to end in 2009. The contract with General Motors Corp ( GM.N ) will contain some job security promises to its major union. But if Lordstown is not chosen for a new model, it will be yet another shuttered factory in the northeastern Ohio industrial heartland, where decades of closures have left a devastated economy. "Don't we need a middle class in this country anymore?" Green asked. His father worked at GM before him, but Green doesn't think his daughters, aged 10 and 7, will find jobs in the area when they grow up. "At this point I wouldn't expect them to stay here. Not because they don't like it or they don't want to be here, but there's little opportunity here." BOOMTOWNS ELSEWHERE It's a different story just 166 miles southwest in Marysville, Ohio, the 25-year-old hub for Honda Motor Co's ( 7267.T ) still-growing North American operations, none of which are unionized. Home to two plants and a research and development complex -- and just a short drive from two more Ohio Honda plants -- once-rural Marysville is enjoying the boom that comes with auto-sector jobs for some 12,500 workers. "Honda must be doing things right because everyone wants to work there," said store supervisor Jan Glassburn, 54, during a break between customers at Goodies Galore gift shop just off Marysville's Main Street. "The population has grown, we're adding schools ... the housing is unbelievable. And we've got all kinds of shops going up. There's a lot of opportunities now in Marysville." While Marysville residents expressed sympathy for GM workers who went on strike to fight for job security and retirement benefits, retired plumber John Bunsold, 62, said the time of strong unions may have passed. "All I've ever driven is a GM," Bunsold said. "But unions have probably had their day ... it seems like they're getting less powerful all the time." The once-mighty UAW has seen its membership at Detroit's Big Three automakers drop to 180,000 from 310,000 in the last four years as U.S. car companies have lost market share to foreign automakers and jobs have been slashed. The uncertain future of U.S. automakers isn't lost on Lordstown Mayor Michael Chaffee. More people work at the GM plant than live in Lordstown village, and the community relies on the plant for $2.5 million in taxes every year -- about 70 percent of the village's budget. Chaffee said he was relieved workers were back at work on Wednesday, but he, too, seemed to be planning for the dark day when the automaker shuts up shop for good. "It would be a devastating blow. There is no Plan B to replace that quantity of jobs -- or that quality of jobs," Chaffee said. "Lordstown (GM) is really the last large employer that we have in the whole region." Chaffee hopes GM will choose Lordstown for its concept Volt electric car, but the village is still desperate to diversify. An Indian resort and casino might locate here, but the hope of that is still years off. "There's a sense of urgency every day, whether the plant stays or not," Chaffee said. The mayor said his own son, in his last year of high school, plans to study "something medical" in college -- nothing auto-related. Still, Chaffee knows that's no guarantee the boy will be able to stay close to home. "There are good hospitals in the area, but even with that, as the population shrinks, those are the kind of collateral hits we'll take," Chaffee said. "I have the same fears and concerns for him that I have for the whole community."
