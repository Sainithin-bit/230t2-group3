 DETROIT  (Reuters) - The United Auto Workers union called a news conference for 4 a.m. ET (0800 GMT) on Wednesday at its headquarters in Detroit. 

 UAW President Ron Gettelfinger and Vice President Cal Rapson, who have led contract negotiations with General Motors Corp, will attend, the union said in a statement. UAW and GM representatives declined to comment. The two sides were nearing a contract deal that would end a three-day-old UAW strike against GM, two people familiar with the talks said earlier on Wednesday.
