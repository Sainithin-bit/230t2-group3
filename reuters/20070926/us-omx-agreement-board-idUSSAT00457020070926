 STOCKHOLM  (Reuters) - The board of Nordic exchange owner OMX OMX.ST said on Wednesday it was considering a new, higher takeover offer from Nasdaq ( NDAQ.O ) and Borse Dubai. 

 "The board of OMX will take today's announcement into consideration in its assessment of the implications of the structure proposed by Nasdaq and Borse Dubai," the board said in a statement. Earlier on Wednesday, Nasdaq and Borse Dubai raised their bid to $4.9 billion and said they had control of 47.6 percent of shares in the Nordic exchange operator. The bid was raised to 265 Swedish crowns per OMX share from 230 crowns, the firms said in a statement. The two firms also said they had also lowered the acceptance level to complete the offer to above 50 percent from the previous level of above 90 percent.
