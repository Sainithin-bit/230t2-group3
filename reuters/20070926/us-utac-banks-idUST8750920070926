 HONG KONG/SINGAPORE  (Reuters) - The $1.4 billion private equity buyout of Singapore's United Test & Assembly Center UTAC.SI is likely to win shareholder approval on October 5, to the potential dismay of the deal's bankers. 

 Underwriters JPMorgan ( JPM.N ), ABN AMRO AAH.AS and Merrill Lynch MER.N may find it hard to cobble together enough investors to finance the buyout on terms agreed before the crisis in global credit markets erupted, financial sources said. The underwriters are trying to convince the private equity funds -- TPG TPG.UL and Affinity Equity Partners -- to cut them some slack, people familiar with the situation said. At the moment, the funds are unwilling to budge on the terms of the acquisition of the microchip tester given the earnings volatility within the semiconductor industry, which would make staying within bank covenants more challenging. However, the funds are also mindful of their global relationships with the investment banks and how much their businesses are linked. "Hopefully a compromise can be reached," a banking source said. Several people involved in the deal suggested the impasse may be settled by precedents set in the United States. Private equity giant KKR KKR.UL is battling with its banks over the terms of its $26 billion purchase of First Data Corp FDC.N. If it can hold its banks to the original terms, other banks may fall into line. One leverage finance banker in Hong Kong with knowledge of the deal said the lenders are hoping the deal is voted down at the shareholder meeting. Private equity firms finance their acquisitions using their own equity and loans from banks. In the case of UTAC, the underwriters have signed contracts to lend about $1.25 billion. If UTAC's underwriters fail to pass on that debt to others, they will be left holding the loans on their own books -- an expensive prospect as it ties up capital. It is unclear how long the underwriters would hold on to the loans, or whether they might sell them on at a discount. TOUGH SALES PITCH Banks and hedge funds are wary of taking the financing off the underwriters' hands because of its structure. The UTAC deal is "covenant lite", meaning it has been stripped of many of the traditional protections lenders are offered. The financing also contains a payment-in-kind toggle, which allows the borrower to defer cash interest payments. "They (banks on the deal) are getting very nervous indeed. The funds have not been willing to change the terms of the deal," the Hong Kong banker said. None of the banks have publicly disclosed the financing structure for the deal. "In general, covenant-lite structures going forward in private equity deals will be very difficult," Philip Lee, chief executive of JPMorgan's investment banking for Southeast Asia, told Reuters last month. He declined to comment on the UTAC deal, as have the deal's other bankers and the buyout firms. Analysts and fund managers told Reuters they expect the deal to win shareholder approval because market conditions have worsened since it was announced, so a better offer is unlikely. Initially some investors including a fund had opposed the deal, saying the offer's valuation was significantly below that of the offer made by Singapore state fund Temasek Holdings TEM.UL for microchip packager STATS ChipPac ( STTS.SI ) STTS.O. Broker CIMB, which had urged UTAC investors to hold out for a better price or a higher rival bid, saying the price offered for UTAC was 11 percent below Temasek's offer for Stats ChipPac on the basis of price-to-book value, now recommends investors vote for the deal. "This is a change from our earlier view to hold out for a better offer," CIMB said in a September 11 note. "Since then, the credit environment has significantly deteriorated and debt financing terms for private equity buyers have become much less favorable." UBS analyst Robert Lea believes shareholders will back the deal. "We think most shareholders will vote in favor, given the increasing concerns on the macroeconomic outlook," he said. "This is potentially the top of the cycle for this business."
