 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Negotiations between the United Auto Workers and General Motors Corp. shifted back into overdrive on Wednesday as a marathon bargaining session brought both sides near a deal that would end a national strike entering its third day. 

 The two sides were nearing a tentative agreement on wages and benefits that would create a trust fund to handle retiree health care and deliver cost-savings to GM, according to two people familiar with the talks who asked not to be named because of the private nature of negotiations. Officials from the union and the top U.S. automaker were still meeting early Wednesday morning in Detroit, extending a bargaining session that began on Tuesday. A tentative contract would have to be ratified by a majority of the more than 73,000 UAW-represented workers who walked out on Monday in the first national strike against GM since 1970. GM and the UAW have not commented on the state of bargaining since Monday, when UAW President Ron Gettelfinger led the union out on strike saying the automaker had not met the union's demands for job security guarantees. Over the weekend, GM and the UAW appeared to be nearing a deal, before talks broke down over the union's insistence that the automaker commit to keep U.S. factories working by promising them future vehicles now in the development stage. Most analysts expected a short strike, arguing neither side can expect to profit from a prolonged walkout that would cost GM badly-needed sales and force working families to get by on strike pay of just $200 per week. The impact from the UAW-ordered shutdown of more than 80 GM facilities in the United States has already hit GM's plants in Canada and Mexico, which depend on parts from U.S. plants to operate. Two GM plants in Ontario, Canada, shut down due to the strike, with GM reviewing the status of another plant. GM's production at three Mexican plants could be hit if the strike is prolonged because of a pledge by the Teamsters union to stop hauling the company's vehicles across the border into the U.S. market. UNION SAYS PUSHED INTO STRIKE The UAW said the automaker pushed the union into striking by not showing a willingness to meet it halfway on crucial issues such as job security. Analysts said a protracted strike against the largest U.S. automaker was unlikely with the two sides seen likely to settle on a wage and benefit deal that delivers many of the cost-saving provisions GM has sought. GM, Ford and Chrysler are seeking concessions from the UAW to close a labor cost gap with Toyota Motor Corp and other automakers operating in the United States. Negotiations between GM and the UAW included a GM proposal to cut health care costs by establishing a trust fund for retiree-related costs. Both sides agreed on the framework for such a plan over the weekend, people briefed on the talks. Under that plan, GM would shift responsibility for retiree health care to a new UAW-aligned trust fund known as a voluntary employee beneficiary association, or VEBA. Wall Street analysts have said establishing a VEBA could cut GM's annual costs by $3 billion in exchange for a one-off payment expected to top $30 billion. The UAW contract talks are seen as crucial to efforts by the Big Three Detroit-based automakers to recover from combined losses of $15 billion last year and sales difficulties that have driven their share of the U.S. market below 50 percent. Although GM shares have slipped by about 5 percent from early highs on Monday before the UAW walked out on strike, the stock remains up almost 12 percent this month.
