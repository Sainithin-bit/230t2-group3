 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Top U.S. automaker General Motors Corp said on Wednesday that its landmark new contract with the United Auto Workers union including a health-care trust is subject to court and regulatory approval. 

 GM said in a statement that following ratification of the tentative deal by its 73,000 hourly workers, who have been on strike since Monday, the U.S. Security and Exchanges Commission will conduct a review of the accounting of the agreement. The automaker said the deal includes a health-care trust for retirees that will improve competitiveness at the struggling company.
