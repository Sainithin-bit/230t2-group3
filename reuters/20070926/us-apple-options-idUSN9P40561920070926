 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - A California judge plans to order Apple Inc ( AAPL.O ) to turn over company board-meeting minutes and records relating to stock options accounting to an investor, according to a newspaper report on Tuesday. 

 California Superior Court Judge Jack Komar in a hearing on Monday said he plans this Friday to order Apple to turn over the documents, dating from 1997 to the present, to the Boston Retirement Board, a shareholder, the San Jose Mercury News said in a report. Komar denied the group's bid to get documents related to the iPod maker's internal investigation into options back-dating and said any documents turned over would be subject to a protective order barring disclosure to any other parties. A representative for Apple could not be immediately reached for comment. (Reporting by  Lisa Baertlein )
