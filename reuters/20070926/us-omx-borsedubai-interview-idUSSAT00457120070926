 STOCKHOLM  (Reuters) - Borse Dubai hopes to get a controlling stake in Nordic exchange operator OMX OMX.ST soon, its chief executive said on Wednesday after the holding company announced it and U.S. partner Nasdaq had raised their bid. 

 Borse Dubai and Nasdaq already control 47.6 percent of OMX shares and Chief Executive Per Larsson said it was difficult to say when they would cross the 50 percent barrier. "We are talking to other shareholders as well. How soon we will get over 50 percent is difficult to say, but hopefully fairly soon," Larsson said in a telephone interview. Borse Dubai and Nasdaq ( NDAQ.O ) earlier on Wednesday raised their bid for OMX to 265 crowns per share -- or $4.9 billion -- from 230 crowns and dropped the acceptance level for the bid to above 50 percent from 90 percent previously. He said it would be difficult for any other bidder to match the price Borse Dubai is offering for OMX and to get the level of support Nasdaq and Borse Dubai have for their bid, not only from OMX shareholders but from the Nordic investment community.
