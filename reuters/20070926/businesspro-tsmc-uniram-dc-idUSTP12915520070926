 TAIPEI  (Reuters) - A U.S. court has ruled that Taiwan 
Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd ( 2330.TW ) misused trade 
secrets of California-based UniRAM and ordered TSMC to pay the 
firm $30.5 million, the Taiwanese company said on Wednesday. 

  TSMC said it has the right to file post-trial motions and 
to appeal against the jury's decision.  "TSMC has always held itself to the highest standards of 
respect for intellectual property and believes that this 
verdict is in error," TSMC ( TSM.N ) vice president and general 
counsel Dick Thurston said in a statement.  "We intend to pursue all defenses vigorously."  TSMC is the world's top contract chip maker.  UniRAM had alleged in a U.S. district court trial that TSMC 
misappropriated trade secrets relating to the design of 
embedded dynamic random-access memory, a specialized computer 
memory device, law firm Susman Godfrey said in a separate 
statement on Tuesday.  TSMC's announcement came after the Taipei stock market 
closed on Wednesday. Its shares ended unchanged at T$61.50 
($1.86), underperforming the main TAIEX's  .TWII  1.67 percent 
gain. (US$1=T$33.1)
