 TOKYO  (Reuters) - The Nasdaq exchange will halt trade in NEC Corp ( 6701.T ) ADRs from September 27, after the Japanese electronics group missed a twice-extended deadline to file an auditor-approved earnings report, NEC said on Wednesday. 

 Shares of NEC, whose products range from phones to supercomputers, slipped 2.5 percent to 541 yen at 0520 GMT, while the benchmark Nikkei  .N225  was up 0.25 percent. That was despite ratings firm Standard & Poor's statement the previous day that the delisting of the American depository receipts, which accounts for around 2.9 percent of NEC's total issued shares, would not change its ratings. The trade suspension is the latest development in accounting woes at NEC, which had been asked by independent auditor Ernst & Young ERNY.UL ShinNihon to demonstrate its pricing of IT maintenance services is fair. Last year, NEC unnerved investors by restating its earnings three times. It had to correct past earnings after it discovered an employee had inflated sales figures. It later switched to Japanese accounting rules from U.S. rules and then had to correct its figures due to human error. U.S. auditors have been scrutinizing software contracts, demanding companies prove with statistical evidence that they are not posting profits early from bulk contracts comprising hardware, software and maintenance. NEC's shares have shed 20 percent since it said it would switch to Japanese accounting rules in October last year, which compares with a 2.8 percent decline for benchmark Nikkei average  .N225  in the same period.
