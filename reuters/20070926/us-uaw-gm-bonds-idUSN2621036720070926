 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Bonds of General Motors ( GM.N ) rose on Wednesday after the automaker reached a tentative deal to end a strike at GM, raising hopes that Detroit's automakers would soon slash their health-care costs. 

 GM's 8.375 percent bond due in 2033 rose 2.25 cents on the dollar on Wednesday to 89 cents, from 86.75 cents on Tuesday, according to MarketAxess. "It's a very positive step that they've come to an agreement," said Mirko Mikelic, portfolio manager and analyst for Fifth Third Asset Management in Grand Rapids, Michigan, as it signals the unions have realized they will have to help the automakers for them to stay globally competitive. For details of the tentative deal see <ID:nL26843859>. Though the general outline of the deal is positive, many details are still missing, Mikelic added. Still unknown is the extent of GM's contribution to the health care fund and whether GM will tap the debt market to fund the agreement, he said. The cost of protecting GM's debt with credit default swaps fell sharply. Five-year credit default swap spreads declined by 55 basis points to about 497 basis points, or $497,000 a year for five years to protect $10 million of debt. Credit protection costs also fell for GM's former unit GMAC LLC and Ford Motor Co ( F.N ). GMAC's five-year CDS spreads narrowed by about 25 basis points to about 325 basis points, while Ford's five-year spreads narrowed by about 35 basis points to about 592. Auto suppliers' bonds rallied sharply. Delphi Corp's DPHIQ.PK 6.5 percent bonds due in 2013 rose 4 cents to 92 cents on the dollar, according to MarketAxess. Dana Corp's DCNAQ.PK 6.5 percent notes due in 2009 rose to 82.25 cents on the dollar, up from 76 cents on Monday, their previous significant trade. (Additional reporting by  Dena Aubin )
