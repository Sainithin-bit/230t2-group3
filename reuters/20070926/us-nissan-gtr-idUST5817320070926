 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co said on Wednesday its all-new GT-R sports car, to be unveiled at the Tokyo Motor Show next month, would start at around 7.8 million yen ($68,010) in Japan, where sales will kick off in December. 

 That makes the car -- previous versions of which were called Skyline GT-R -- Nissan's second-most expensive in its product line-up after the President saloon, a spokeswoman said. The latest special edition version launched in 2002 started at 6.1 million yen ($53,190). The new GT-R, which last underwent a full remodeling in 1999, goes on sale in the United States, Europe and other markets next year. Nissan, Japan's third-biggest automaker held 44 percent by Renault SA, is counting on the iconic sports car to polish its brand image and drive global sales of its mass-volume models, which have trailed those of domestic rivals Toyota Motor Corp and Honda Motor Co. No other details were given, including engine type, horsepower and other specifications. Nissan said it has set up 160 centers in Japan to provide specialist servicing for GT-R customers.
