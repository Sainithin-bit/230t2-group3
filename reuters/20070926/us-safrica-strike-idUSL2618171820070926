 JOHANNESBURG  (Reuters) - A two-week strike by some 50,000 workers that had halted output at Volkswagen AG ( VOWG.DE ), DaimlerChrysler ( DAIGn.DE ) and other car makers in South Africa ended late on Tuesday, a union official said on Wednesday. 

 Workers agreed to resume work on Wednesday and Thursday, Elias Kubeka, the national coordinator of the motor car components at the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (NUMSA) said. The union settled for a wage increase of between 8.5-10 percent from employers, he added. They had initially demanded a 9 percent across the board increase. "It (strike) has been called off, workers will return to work today (Wednesday) and tomorrow," he said. Kubeka had said on Tuesday the union -- the biggest union in the automobile industry -- was still polling its members countrywide to know by later that day if they would accept the latest wage offer. Local media quoted the union's spokesman Mziwakhe Hlangani as saying the strike would be called off once the deal is signed later on Tuesday. Hlangani could not be reached for comment. Nissan ( 7201.T ), Toyota ( 7203.T ) and Ford ( F.N ) were also badly affected by the strike. Car makers in South Africa employ about 39,000 workers. Volkswagen's main South African plant last week said it was unable to meet export orders in the Asia Pacific region and was losing production at the rate of 500 cars a day. South Africa has suffered a series of strikes over pay in the past three months in key industries including refineries and mines and there was also a four-week civil servants stoppage that crippled state hospitals and schools.
