 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp ( MSFT.O ) is offering to replace damaged discs of its just-launched "Halo 3" game for the Xbox amid reports that special limited-edition packaging is scratching them. 

 On its Xbox Website, Microsoft says the disc replacement program covers the "Halo 3" limited edition game disc and essentials disc at no charge through the end of the year. Microsoft began selling "Halo 3" on Tuesday, and the acclaimed alien shooter game is seen as the $30 billion video game industry's equivalent of a new "Harry Potter" book. The Associated Press said that blogs were brimming with reports that special limited-edition packaging is scratching the videogame discs.
