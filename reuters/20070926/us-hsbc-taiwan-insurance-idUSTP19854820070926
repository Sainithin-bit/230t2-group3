 TAIPEI  (Reuters) - HSBC Holdings ( HSBA.L ), Europe's biggest bank, said on Wednesday it will open an insurance business in Taiwan as it aims to tap into the fourth-biggest insurance market in Asia. 

 The operation, which would be the British bank's third new move this year in Asia, where it has vowed to expand more aggressively. HSBC ( 0005.HK ) will face tough competition in the big but highly competitive Taiwan market, which is filled with local players such as Cathay ( 2882.TW ) and Shin Kong ( 2888.TW ), as well as multinationals including ING ( ING.AS ), Aviva Plc ( AV.L ), Prudential Plc ( PRU.L ) and Metlife ( MET.N ). HSBC will hold a briefing on Thursday to detail the new operation in Taiwan, which will sell insurance products through its branches on the island, a spokesperson said, adding that no tie-ups are involved. HSBC ( 0005.HK ) said this month it was paying about US$255 million for 10 percent of Bao Viet to become the sole foreign investor in Vietnam's largest insurer. In March, Indian state-run lenders Canara Bank ( CNBK.BO ) and Oriental Bank of Commerce ( ORBC.BO ) also said they would form a life insurance joint venture with HSBC. ($1=T$32.93)
