 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co.( F.N ) said on Wednesday it was pleased that the United Auto Workers union was able to reach a tentative four-year labor  deal with General Motors Corp( GM.N ). 

 "We are pleased they were able to reach an agreement," Ford spokeswoman Marcey Evans said. The tentative UAW-GM contract, which includes a groundbreaking health-care trust fund, ended a national strike by 73,000 GM workers. UAW President Ron Gettelfinger said earlier on Wednesday that a decision on the next bargaining target for a new contract -- either Ford or Chrysler LLC -- could be made on Thursday this week.
