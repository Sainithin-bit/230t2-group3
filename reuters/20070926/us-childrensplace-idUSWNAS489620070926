 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Children's Place Retail Stores ( PLCE.O ) fired Chief Executive Ezra Dabah on Wednesday and named board member Chuck Crovitz as interim CEO, sending its shares up as much as 9 percent. 

 The children's clothing retailer said an investigation found Dabah did not comply with its securities-trading policies. The internal probe also found irregularities in expense reimbursement practices by its chief creative officer. Dabah did not properly report an immaterial increase in his wife's ownership of company shares from a trust distribution, and on two occasions he pledged shares during a "black-out period" without required prior approval, the company said. Children's Place said Dabah would remain a member of its board, which requested his resignation. Because of its change in leadership, Children's Place said it needed additional time to file delinquent financial statements with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including its annual report for the year ended in February. The company said it did not fire its chief creative officer, whom it did not name, but "imposed significant sanctions," including the refund of amounts erroneously charged. None of the violations have a material effect on its results, said the company, which runs the Disney Store chain and its namesake clothing chain. Children's Place shares shot up 9 percent to $26.16 following the news and were up $1.80 to $25.79 in late-morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange. Last week an investor sued Children's Place and several of its executives, alleging concealment of material information about the company's profitability, an options investigation, the status of its license agreement with Walt Disney Co ( DIS.N ), and other factors that hurt its stock price. Children's Place shares are down 60 percent this year after the company disclosed in August that its quarterly net loss nearly doubled and forecast full-year earnings way below analysts' estimates.
