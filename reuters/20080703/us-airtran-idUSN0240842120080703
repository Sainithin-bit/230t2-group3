 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - AirTran Holdings Inc AAI.N told employees it will cut salaries and wages by about 10 percent and warned that more cutbacks may be necessary as its airline struggles with high fuel prices, The Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday. 

 Non-fuel operating costs at AirTran are about half those of most major airlines, but Chairman and Chief Executive Bob Fornaro told employees in an internal memo that "the high cost of oil poses a serious threat to the future of AirTran," the Journal reported on its website. An AirTran spokesman was not immediately available for comment. (Reporting by  Robert MacMillan ; Editing by  Tomasz Janowski )
