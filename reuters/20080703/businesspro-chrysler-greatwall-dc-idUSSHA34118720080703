 SHANGHAI  (Reuters) - Chrysler LLC CBS.UL has signed a 
memorandum of understanding with China's Great Wall Motor Co 
( 2333.HK ) to explore long-term business ties in various areas 
including distribution, components and technology. 

  The move is part of Chrysler's drive for greater 
involvement in China's auto industry, it said in statement.  No details were provided.  Chrysler sells more than 10 models in China but only four, 
including the 300C, are manufactured locally, via partnerships.  The number-three U.S. automaker is discussing joint 
ventures with a number of potential Chinese partners, including 
Chery Automobile, Chrysler executives told Reuters in April.  Chery finalized a deal last year with Chrysler to make 
compact cars under the Chrysler badge for sale in the Americas 
and elsewhere.  (Reporting by Fang Yan; Editing by Edmund Klamann)
