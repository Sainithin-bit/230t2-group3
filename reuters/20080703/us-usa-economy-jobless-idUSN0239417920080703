 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The number of U.S. workers filing new claims for jobless benefits jumped 16,000 last week to 404,000 and a key moving average stood at the highest level since 2005, government data on Thursday showed. 

 Initial claims for state unemployment insurance benefits had been forecast by analysts polled by Reuters to rise to a seasonally adjusted 385,000 from a revised 388,000 the week before. This was initially reported by the Labor Department as 384,000. The four-week average of new jobless claims, a better gauge of underlying labor trends because it irons out week-to-week volatility, increased for the fourth straight week to 390,500, the highest reading since October 2005 in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. A Labor Department official said there were no special factors impacting the data last week. The number of people remaining on the benefits roll after drawing an initial week of aid fell 19,000 to a less-than-forecast 3.116 million in the week ended June 21, the most recent week that these figures were available. Analysts estimated so-called continued claims would be 3.140 million. But it was the tenth straight week that claims were above 3 million, in a sign that the slowing economy is making it harder for U.S. workers to find jobs.
