 (Reuters) - Calyon Securities's Ray Neidl widened his 
second-quarter and 2008 loss estimates for some large U.S. 
carriers, and forecast an industry-wide loss of about $6.5 
billion for the year, saying fuel costs had increased faster 
than expected. 

  "Persistently ever higher fuel costs remain the industry's 
major threat at this time with economic softness, labor unrest 
and what seems to be government indifference over aviation 
infrastructure," Neidl said in a research note.  Neidl expects an industry-wide loss of about $800 million 
for the second quarter.  The analyst, who has a "neutral" rating on all the airline 
stocks that he covers, said though he expects the airlines to 
continue to take drastic actions, it was too early to determine 
if the planned capacity cuts for the slower post-summer travel 
season would be successful.  Though most stocks are already trading near bankruptcy 
levels, Neidl said they could still make it at least into 2009 
without filing for bankruptcy.  "If oil prices stay high, we expect a vastly smaller 
industry for at least a few years until adjustments and 
restructuring can be completed, the analyst said.
