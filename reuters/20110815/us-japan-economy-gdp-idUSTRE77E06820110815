 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japan's economy contracted at a slower pace than expected in the second quarter as output and exports recovered from the deadly earthquake in March, but a soaring yen and slowing global growth cloud the outlook for an economy emerging from recession. 

 Analysts expect the economy to rebound in July-September, probably at the fastest rate among major industrialized nations, as companies made faster-than-expected progress in restoring supply chains hit by the March quake. But growing risks to this scenario could strain a depleted arsenal of policy tools. Following are key points from the gross domestic product (GDP) data: -- GDP shrank 0.3 percent in the second quarter, the third straight contraction, the longest streak since four straight quarters of contraction between April-June 2008 and January-March in 2009. -- Annualised GDP for April-June shrank 1.3 percent from the previous quarter, also the third straight quarter of contraction, but better than the minus 2.6 percent projected by economists. -- Private consumption, which accounts for about 60 percent of Japan's economy, slipped 0.1 percent, the third straight quarter of decline, but the level of falls narrowed from a 0.6 percent drop the quarter before. -- Capital spending rose 0.2 percent, the first increase in two quarters, after a revised 1.4 percent fall in January-March. -- Exports declined 4.9 percent in April-June, the biggest fall since a 25.3 percent of drop in January-March 2009, due to declines in overseas demand, supply constraints and the yen's appreciation. -- Public investment rose 3.0 percent in the second quarter, the first climb in six quarters, helped by government spending on reconstruction after the quake and tsunami. -- Net exports shaved 0.8 percentage point off Japan's GDP in April-June, making a negative contribution for the fourth straight quarter. -- Domestic demand helped 0.4 percentage point of GDP growth, a positive contribution for the first time in three quarters. -- The GDP deflator fell 2.2 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier, falling for a seventh quarter in a row.
