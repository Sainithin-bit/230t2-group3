 BERLIN  (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Nicolas Sarkozy will address the euro zone debt crisis on when they meet in Paris on Tuesday but the two will not discuss the creation of common sovereign bonds. 

 "The German government has said on numerous occasions that it does not believe Eurobonds make sense and that's why they will not play any role at tomorrow's meeting," government spokesman Steffen Seibert said. (Reporting by Erik Kirschabum and  Brian Rohan )
