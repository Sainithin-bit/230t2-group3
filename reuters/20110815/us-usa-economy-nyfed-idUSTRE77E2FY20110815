 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The New York state manufacturing sector contracted for the third straight month in August, tempering hopes that the first-half slowdown in the U.S. economy might be turning around. 

 Manufacturing led the U.S. recovery in the past couple of years, even though it only represents about 12 percent of overall economic activity, but growth in the sector has slowed sharply in recent months. The survey of manufacturing plants in New York state is one of the earliest regional guideposts to U.S. factory conditions. The general business conditions index fell to minus 7.72 from minus 3.76 the month before, according to the New York Federal Reserve's Empire State index. Economists polled by Reuters had expected a reading of zero. "While this is just the first of regional indicators, it does a fairly good job of predicting what the others will do," said Millan Mulraine, senior U.S. macroeconomic strategist at TD Securities. "We're still somewhat far off from getting into a double dip recession, but it suggests sluggish growth for the next quarter," he added. New orders fell to their lowest level since November 2010, slipping to minus 7.82 from minus 5.45, while inventories fell to minus 7.61 from minus 5.56. But the employment gauge showed a slight improvement. The index for the number of employees inched up to 3.26 from 1.11 and the average employee work week index rose to minus 2.17 from minus 15.56. Prices paid eased, falling to 28.26 from 43.33. The index was also at its lowest level since November 2010. The outlook for the months to come also deteriorated, falling to the lowest level since February 2009. The index of business conditions six months ahead dropped to 8.70 from 32.22. "This is consistent with the negative tone that has permeated throughout the markets. Clearly we are not starting the new round of manufacturing data on good footing," said Tom Porcelli, chief U.S. economist at RBC Capital Markets. U.S. stock index futures trimmed gains immediately following the data, but Wall Street opened higher following a volatile week. Treasury prices briefly gained and the U.S. dollar hit a session low against the yen. RECENT DATA MIXED Monday's regional manufacturing data follows a slump in August consumer sentiment for the third month in a row to the lowest level since 1980 in the University of Michigan survey on Friday, but contrasts with the biggest jump in four months in retail sales for July also reported last week. The U.S.'s second largest home improvement retailer, Lowe's Cos Inc ( LOW.N ) reported weaker-than-expected quarterly sales and cut its fiscal-year outlook for the second time in three months on Monday as home owners put off big renovations in an anemic U.S. economy. "Despite some recovery in our seasonal business, our performance for the quarter fell short of our expectations," said Robert Niblock, Lowe's chairman, president and CEO. Many U.S. homeowners have been hesitant to spend on expensive renovations as housing prices fall and the economy shows few signs of a stable recovery. In other data on Monday, foreigners were net sellers of all U.S. assets in June for a second straight month and bought the fewest long-term securities in more than two years, data from the U.S. Treasury Department showed. Foreigners were also net sellers of Treasury debt for the first time since May 2009, as heavy selling from private investors outweighed buying from central banks. Treasuries suffered a net outflow of $4.5 billion, the first since May 2009, but China, the largest foreign U.S. creditor, increased Treasury holdings by $5.7 billion to $1.166 trillion.
