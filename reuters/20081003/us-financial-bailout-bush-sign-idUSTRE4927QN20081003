 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - President George W. Bush on Friday signed landmark $700 billion legislation to help lenders unload distressed real estate assets off their books, a move aimed at curbing a spreading financial crisis. 

 The White House confirmed that Bush had signed the bill, which was approved earlier by the House of Representatives, just before he was due to leave for a political fund-raiser in St. Louis and a weekend stay at his Texas ranch. (Reporting by  Jeremy Pelofsky , Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)
