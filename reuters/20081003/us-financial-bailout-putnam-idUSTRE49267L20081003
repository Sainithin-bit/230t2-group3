 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - A Republican member of the House of Representatives Financial Services Committee said on Friday he believed there were now enough votes in the House to pass a $700 billion financial bailout bill. 

 Asked on CNBC television whether supporters had enough 'yes' votes to pass the bill, Rep. Adam Putnam of Florida said: "We feel like we do. (House) Speaker (Nancy) Pelosi has said she will not bring the bill to the floor if it doesn't appear they have the votes to pass it." He said both Democratic and Republican leaders had been talking to their members to line up the votes. He said public comments had indicated a number of lawmakers who had voted against the bill on Monday had been persuaded to vote for it by new data or changes that had been made to the bill.
