 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives will not schedule a vote for Thursday on a huge financial industry bailout bill, senior House Democratic aides said. 

 While House leaders are hoping to bring the $700 billion bill to the House on Friday, they did not give any further details on the floor schedule for the rest of the week. (Reporting by  Richard Cowan )
