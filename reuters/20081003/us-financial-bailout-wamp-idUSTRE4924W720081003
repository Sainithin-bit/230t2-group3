 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - A Republican in the House of Representatives who voted against the Wall Street bailout bill on Monday and now supports it predicted on Friday that enough votes "are probably in place" for passage. 

 Rep. Zach Wamp of Tennessee left a closed-door meeting of House Republicans and told reporters that there were at least 12 House Republicans and eight House Democrats who planned to switch their votes to support the $700 billion financial industry bailout. "I believe there is enough movement on both sides" to pass the bill, Wamp said. Only a few lawmakers are poised to switch their votes in the other direction, from "yes" on Monday to "no" on Friday, he added. (Reporting by  Richard Cowan , editing by Gerald E. McCormick)
