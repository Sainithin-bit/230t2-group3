 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Family Dollar Stores Inc ( FDO.N ) posted a higher-than-expected quarterly profit on Friday, helped by shoppers who spent tax rebate checks at the discount retailer, and cost controls. 

 It shares rose more than 4 percent. The company, which prices most of its merchandise below $10, also forecast fiscal 2009 earnings that may top analysts' expectations, banking on tight cost controls and strong sales of consumable items like food and household cleaners. Family Dollar's discount stores cater to lower-income consumers, many with income under $30,000 a year, who are being hit by rising food costs, surging fuel prices, a U.S. housing downturn and credit crunch. The company has said its shoppers have been forced to consolidate store trips and spend less on items such as clothing as they spend more for food and other essentials. "I want to stress that at no other time in our history have we faced such economic uncertainty," said Chief Executive Howard Levine on a conference call. "I would remind you that the impact of even small shifts in the environment can have an immediate and severe impact on our core customer." On the call, Levine also said the turmoil in financial markets added to the economic uncertainty. Levine said in a statement that as Family Dollar's main shoppers continue to struggle amid "rising unemployment, strong inflationary pressures and volatile energy prices," the company will continue to focus on their needs. FOURTH-QUARTER RESULTS For the fiscal fourth quarter, ended August 30, net income rose to $53.2 million, or 38 cents per share, from $37.8 million, or 26 cents per share, a year ago. Analysts, on average, expected earnings of 34 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Sales rose 8.2 percent to $1.77 billion. Sales at stores open at least a year, a key retail gauge known as same-store sales, rose 5.6 percent. Levine said the company adjusted its product lineup to invest in consumable items, which shoppers needed most, while reducing its exposure in areas such as clothing and home. Consumable items' sales rose 12.8 percent. Sales of discretionary items improved from the prior quarter. Sales of seasonal items and electronics rose 9.4 percent, whereas they were down 1.8 percent in the third quarter. The company said that "so far this quarter" sales trends were similar to August, when it reported a same-store sales gain of 3.6 percent. That could be cheering investors, who see other retailers that sell more discretionary items struggle, said Piper Jaffray retail analyst Mitchell Kaiser. "For them to say that they are comping net three to four percent range ... is a relief to investors," Kaiser said. "That's probably why the stock is up today." While quarterly sales benefited from the U.S. government's tax rebate checks to shoppers, Levine had cautioned in July that the benefit would be short-lived, and the retailer was planning conservatively for holiday sales. Its view on the holidays "makes a lot of sense" considering economic worries, executives said during the call. About half of its stores will accept credit cards this holiday season, the company said. RIDING THE CONSUMABLES WAVE For fiscal 2009, which ends next August 29, the company expects sales to increase 3 percent to 5 percent, helped by strong sales of consumable items such as food. Same-store sales are expected to rise 1 percent to 3 percent. Family Dollar expects to earn between $1.58 per share to $1.78 per share for fiscal 2009, compared with analysts' expectations for earnings of $1.56 to $1.76 per share. The breadth of its earnings forecast reflects how squeezed shoppers are, and the resulting uncertainty, Kaiser said. The company, which operates more than 6,500 stores, expects to open around 200 stores in fiscal 2009. Levine said the company would lower costs through measures such as procuring more private label items. It also aims to reduce shrinkage -- which measures inventory lost to employee theft and shoplifting, he said. For the first quarter of fiscal 2009, the company forecast sales to rise 4 percent to 6 percent and a same-store sales increase of 2 percent to 4 percent. Family Dollar expects to earn 38 cents per share to 42 cents per share in the quarter. Analysts expect it to earn 40 cents per share in the quarter. Family Dollar shares were up $1.17 to $25.37, after rising as high as $26.05 on the New York Stock Exchange. (Editing by  Brian Moss  and Steve Orlofsky)
