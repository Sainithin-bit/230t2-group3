 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Shares of Citigroup fell 8 percent to $20.69 in pre-market trade after a merger deal was announced between Wachovia Corp and Wells Fargo & Co. 

 The planned Wachovia-Wells Fargo tie up would scupper a previously announced deal in which Citigroup was to buy parts of Wachovia. Wachovia said on Friday that Citigroup was no longer involved. (Editing by Theodore d'Afflisio)
