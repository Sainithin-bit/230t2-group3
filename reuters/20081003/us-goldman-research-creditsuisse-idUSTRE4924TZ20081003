 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc ( GS.N ) may bid for deposits, possibly buy banks in distress situations, as part of its transition to a traditional bank holding company, Credit Suisse said in a note to clients. 

 Any such acquisitions would however be done on a smaller scale, analyst Susan Katzke said, noting the company's historical bias toward organic growth. "Goldman has historically been biased toward organic growth strategies; we expect that bias to be unchanged," analyst Susan Katzke wrote in a note to clients. Katzke recommended buying Goldman's stock as a core financial services holding. Shares of the company were trading up 2.8 percent at $135.22 in early trade on the New York Stock Exchange.
