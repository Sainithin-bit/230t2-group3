 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. banking regulators on Friday said they have not yet reviewed Wells Fargo and Co's surprise deal to acquire rival bank Wachovia Corp and issues that the purchase would raise. 

 "The regulators will be working with the parties to achieve an outcome that protects all Wachovia creditors, including depositors, insured and uninsured, and promotes market stability," the Federal Reserve said in a joint statement with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which regulates national banks. The regulators said a Citigroup proposal to had undergone "extensive review" by the government. (Reporting by  Mark Felsenthal ; Editing by  Chizu Nomiyama )
