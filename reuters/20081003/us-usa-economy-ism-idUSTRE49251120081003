 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The sluggish U.S. service sector barely grew in September, according to a report released on Friday. 

 KEY POINTS: * The Institute for Supply Management said its non-manufacturing index came in at 50.2, slightly below August's 50.6 in August. A reading above 50 signals expansion. * Economists had expected a result of 50.0, according to the median of forecasts in a Reuters poll. The 73 forecasts ranged from 48.3 to 51.9. * The service sector represents about 80 percent of U.S. economic activity, including businesses such as banks, airlines, hotels and restaurants. COMMENTS: JOSH STILES, BOND STRATEGIST, IDEAGLOBAL.COM, NEW YORK: "The number came very close to market expectations. I like to look at backlog of orders and new orders, and the backlog of orders was very weak, especially for the services sector. New orders picked up a little bit but it is barely expansionary. The employment portion was consistent with a very weak payrolls number. It is a pretty dark picture for the U.S. economy at year end, and I do not get anything in this ISM non-manufacturing to suggest maybe it is not so bad. "GARY SCHLOSSBERG, SENIOR ECONOMIST, WELLS CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, SAN FRANCISCO: "Given what we saw in the employment report, this eases some of the concerns about the economy. This suggests the economy is not unraveling." MARKET REACTION: STOCKS: U.S. stocks hold near session highs after data. BONDS: Treasury prices hold steady at lower levels. DOLLAR: U.S. dollar holds gains against euro. RATE FUTURES: Fed fund futures continue to price in 100 percent chance of 50 basis point rate cut in October.
