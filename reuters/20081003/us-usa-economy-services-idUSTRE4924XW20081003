 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The sluggish service sector was barely growing in September as the country's worst financial crisis since the Great Depression reached new heights, according to a report released on Friday. 

 The Institute for Supply Management said its non-manufacturing index came in at 50.2, marginally above the level of 50 that signals expansion, with the help of a slight rise in new orders. Financial markets, starved for any good news, took the report as a slight positive for the beleaguered economy, but few doubt it is in rough shape after being pounded this year by high energy costs and the worst housing slump in a generation. "It is a pretty dark picture for the U.S. economy at year end, and I do not get anything in this ISM non-manufacturing to suggest maybe it is not so bad," said Josh Stiles, bond strategist at IDEAglobal.com in New York. The service sector represents about 80 percent of U.S. economic activity, including businesses such as banks, airlines, hotels and restaurants. The ISM result was lightly below August's reading of 50.6 and marginally above economists' median expectation of 50.0 forecast in a Reuters poll. Stocks  .DJI  kept near session highs after the report, maintaining gains on the back of hopes that the House of Representatives would pass a $700 billion bill to halt the spreading credit crisis. U.S. government bonds, which benefit more from weak economic data, were lower on the day. Earlier, government data showed the United States suffered its ninth consecutive month of job losses in September and the biggest drop in 5-1/2 years. The ISM report's gauge of service sector employment fell in September and was in contractionary territory for a fifth straight month, the first slump of this magnitude since 2003. With good news hard to find, investors and Federal Reserve policy makers are likely to be happy with a fall in the report's gauge of inflation to its lowest in a year, which will help the Fed -- the U.S. central bank -- keep benchmark interest rates low to ride out the financial crisis.
