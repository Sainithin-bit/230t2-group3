 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - President George W. Bush on Thursday said the $700 billion financial bailout legislation before the House of Representatives was the best chance for easing the current credit crisis. 

 "The bill that's before the House of Representatives tomorrow is a bill that has got the best chance of providing liquidity, providing credit, providing money so small businesses and medium-sized businesses can function," he said after meeting with representatives of small businesses. The Senate approved the legislation late Wednesday. (Reporting by  Tabassum Zakaria ; Editing by  James Dalgleish )
