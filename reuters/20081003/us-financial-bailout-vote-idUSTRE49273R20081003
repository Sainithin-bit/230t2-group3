 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The House of Representatives on Friday approved the Bush administration's $700 billion financial rescue package, reversing a shock rejection of the measure earlier in the week that had sent global stock markets into a panic. 

 KEY POINTS: * The tally to approve the bill was 263 in favor vs 171 against. * Initial market reactions were muted compared with the huge sell off in stocks witnessed after Monday's rejection by the House of the original bill. COMMENTS: DAVID KELLY, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, JPMORGAN ASSET MANAGEMENT, NEW YORK: "It's a necessary but not sufficient condition to get us out of this mess. "There are more questions than answers out there still, but obviously this is a positive for both the stock market and credit markets in general. "Given how onerous some of the conditions are on this whole package, will the Treasury be able to get banks to participate? And the second question is, even if banks do participate, how willing will they be to make new loans into the economy if they can get rid of the bad ones, the old ones." MARK FREEMAN, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT AND PORTFOLIO MANAGER, WESTWOOD HOLDINGS GROUP, DALLAS: "Treasuries had seen a little bit of a selloff as it looked like the vote would actually pass. Now reality has set in from there. The bigger issue for the bond market is how does the short end of the Treasury curve behave, because that reflects the current dislocation in the credit markets." TOM BENTZ, BNP PARIBAS COMMODITY FUTURES INC., NEW YORK: "Obviously, we know that big picture demand is the big question at this point. Is this going to bring demand back-- we don't know, it's going to take time to see that. "I think there are still a lot of questions as to whether or not this bill is going to save the economy anyway. The crude market is saying, how is this really going to change demand at this point? I don't know if you can say that directly just from this bill passing." JOHN CANAVAN, ANALYST, STONE & MCCARTHY RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, PRINCETON, NEW JERSEY: "A lot of it has been priced in here, I think you are seeing that -- equities have ticked off their best levels a little bit and Treasuries have ticked off of their lows. A lot of it has been priced in and it remains to be seen what the longer-term impact is. There may still be room for a little more near-term profit-taking in Treasuries, so in the near-term we may lose a little bit more ground. But, it doesn't change the economic situation drastically over the next couple of quarters and that is quite negative." MICHAEL MORAN, CHIEF ECONOMIST, DAIWA SECURITIES AMERICA, NEW YORK: "The passage of the package should provide some near-term stability in financial markets, but a good deal of uncertainty remains about the longer-term impact because the securities involved are difficult to price and, therefore, the ultimate success of the program is uncertain." JOE SALUZZI, CO-MANAGER OF TRADING AT THEMIS TRADING IN CHATHAM, NEW JERSEY: "We're not seeing much of a rally, though we expected a 'sell the news' reaction,' with the market selling off after a brief run-up. The key will be if we stabilize by the end of the day. But there are questions ahead: how do you implement this plan, and how much is it going to help? They won't dole out the money immediately, so it's not like a Fed rate cut where you get an automatic reaction. We're still in the thick of this. It's like turning a cruise ship around. You can't do it on a dime. It takes a long time to turn something like that around. You can't turn it around like a speedboat." PETER BEUTEL, PRESIDENT, CAMERON HANOVER, ENERGY TRADING CONSULTANT, IN NEW CANAAN, CONNECTICUT: "It's good news that they passed it. This is definitely positive news for the economy. It is good news that the House is finally able to get this passed -- people were uncertain that the government was fully working but now it is. Is it going to change anything for demand for oil? Probably not, but now it doesn't look like we're headed for a repeat of the Great Depression." JOHN KILDUFF, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT, MF GLOBAL, NEW YORK: "The global markets just got a massive injection of liquidity, finally. While this situation is far from over, this should allow all asset classes to reinflate and stabilize at least for a time." MARK WAGGONER, PRESIDENT, EXCEL FUTURES, HUNTINGTON BEACH, CALIFORNIA: "The stock market will rally here as the calming effect of the House vote sets in. Commodity prices also, including oil, will go up as this unprecedented action sinks in. Rallies will be the order near-term but don't discount the long-term possibility of a downtrend." VASSILI SEREBRIAKOV, CURRENCY STRATEGIST, WELLS FARGO, NEW YORK: "We think the bill is a negative for the dollar. Much of the recent dollar strength was exaggerated by demand for dollar liquidity in the money markets. As long as this bill eases the conditions somewhat, the dollar will suffer." CHRIS JARVIS, SENIOR ANALYST, CAPROCK RISK MANAGEMENT, HAMPTON FALLS, NEW HAMPSHIRE: "Today's 'take two' vote by the U.S. House of Representatives is historic, and regardless of the critical views on the bill, is likely going to be enough to jolt the credit markets out of their current dysfunctional state, which should provide a relief rally for the markets across the board." "With the flow of credit reestablished, the global markets will be able to leave the operating room and be moved into the ICU (Intensive Care Unit) to stabilize. Although we believe the initial markets' move will be a significant relief rally, following the rally, we believe confidence will be restored slowly, likely leading to a flat-line, or range bound markets, for some time." "In summary, following the shock to the system, the markets/economy will have to rehab for some time before being released from the hospital." MARKET REACTION: STOCKS: Benchmark U.S. stock remain up on the day but sell off a bit on the news. BONDS: Treasury prices remain lower but off the session's lows. DOLLAR: U.S. dollar drops against the euro and pares gains against the yen. RATE FUTURES: Fed fund futures hold gains, see 50 basis point rate cut in October.
