 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission announced on Friday its ban on financial stock short-selling will expire at 11:59 p.m. ET on Wednesday, October 8. 

 Earlier in the week, the SEC said the ban would expire three business days after a $700 billion federal bailout bill was enacted by Congress. The emergency ban was part of a series of government measures designed to restore confidence in battered markets and the ailing financial system.
