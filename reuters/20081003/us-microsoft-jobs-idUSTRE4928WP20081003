 SEATTLE  (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp ( MSFT.O ) said on Friday it is reviewing its hiring plans in light of tough economic conditions, but denied reports it had instituted a company-wide hiring freeze. 

 IDG News Service, citing a source close to the company, reported earlier on Friday that Microsoft sent out an internal memo calling for a hiring freeze. Microsoft spokesman Lou Gellos said the report of a hiring freeze was untrue. The company said it plans to grow and add thousands of new jobs this year, while acknowledging the need to be careful. "Given the current economic environment we are taking the prudent step of reviewing our hiring plans and will make some adjustments as appropriate," Gellos said in a e-mail. Microsoft, the world's largest software maker with more than 91,000 employees worldwide, has been on a hiring spree, adding more than 20,000 employees in the last two years. Earlier this week, Chief Executive Steve Ballmer said the company is not immune to the global financial crisis and that, like other companies, it will feel the sting from a decline in business and consumer spending.
