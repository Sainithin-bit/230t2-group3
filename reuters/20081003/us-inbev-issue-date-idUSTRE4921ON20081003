 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - Inbev INTB.BR shares fell on Friday after the world's second biggest brewer said it expected a contraction of its core margin and higher input costs in the third quarter of 2008. 

 "Trends experienced in the first half of 2008, such as revenue growth ahead of volume growth, and continued cost pressure resulting in a slight contraction in EBITDA margin, are expected to continue in the third quarter 2008," it said in a statement. At 6:07 a.m. EDT its stock was down 3.3 percent while the wider DJ Stoxx European food and beverage index dropped by 0.4 percent. "The trading update indicates a slightly weaker than expected third quarter performance," said KBC analyst Wim Hoste in a note to clients. Rabo Securities analysts also attributed the fall to the weaker than expected trading update. As a result of inflationary pressures and commodities prices, the group expects the full-year cost of sales to be slightly above the previously expected 5 percent to 6 percent. In its Latin America South region, barley and malt prices are growing 41 percent year-to-date and wages are also increasing to offset higher real inflation rates. Malt and hops prices have also increased year-to-date in Russia and Ukraine at rates of about 60 percent for malt and 85 percent for hops on average, the group said. Inbev does, however, expect to see cost improvements in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared to the fourth quarter of 2007, as commodities prices ease. In Western Europe, Inbev said it expected total volumes to decline, but added its own beer volumes are likely to grow in the lower single digit percentage range. The brewer said it had gained or maintained market share in eight of its top 10 markets and added its global brands Beck's and Stella Artois are also growing in the low single digit percentage range. North America, Latin America North, Latin America South and Asia Pacific are expected to report growth in total volumes, while in Western Europe and Central and Eastern Europe small declines in volumes are expected to occur. Separately, InBev said it expected that the subscription period for its $9.8 billion rights issue to complete the takeover of peer Anheuser-Busch ( BUD.N ) will be open from October 16, 2008 to October 30. The timing of the rights issue is subject to a final decision by its Board of Directors to proceed with and effectively launch the rights issue. BNP Paribas, Deutsche Bank and J.P. Morgan are acting as joint global coordinators and joint bookrunners for the rights offering. Fortis Bank, ING, ABN AMRO and Santander are acting as joint lead managers. The definitive dates of the subscription period, and other terms of the rights issue, will be detailed in an announcement to be published by InBev in due course, the group said in a statement.
