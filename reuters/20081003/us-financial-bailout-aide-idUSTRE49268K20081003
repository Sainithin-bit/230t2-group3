 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - A $700 billion financial industry bailout bill appears to be "in good shape" for passage by the House of Representatives, a senior House Republican aide said on Friday. 

 Debate on the landmark bill was winding down in the House, with a vote on passage expected soon. House Republicans helped defeat an earlier version of the bill on Monday and party leaders have been working to secure enough votes on the revised bill now being debated. (Reporting by  Richard Cowan )
