 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Dick's Sporting Goods Inc. ( DKS.N ) said on Wednesday its quarterly profit nearly doubled, helped by its February purchase of Golf Galaxy and higher sales at established stores. The sporting goods retailer said first-quarter net income rose to $21.7 million, or 38 cents a share, from $11.4 million, or 21 cents a share, a year earlier. Quarterly net sales totaled $823.6 million, falling short of Wall Street's expectations. Analysts, on average, had expected the Pittsburgh-based retailer to earn 37 cents a share on sales of $851.8 million, according to Reuters Estimates. Comparable store sales rose 2 percent during the quarter, the company said. Chief Executive Edward W. Stack said sales were hurt by the "timing of spring break due to the Easter shift and unplayable field conditions" in the U.S. Northeast and Midwest. "We were very pleased with our sales results considering the later-than-expected start to the spring sports seasons," Stack said in a statement. Golf Galaxy's operating results were included in Dick's quarterly tally. "Dick's made up for sales weakness with a much better-than-expected gross margin," Deutsche Bank analyst Mike Baker wrote in a research note. "If the stock is weak on soft sales, we'd be buyers as it appears that the sluggishness is temporary and has recovered," wrote Baker, who recommends buying Dick's stock. Looking ahead, Dick's said it sees second-quarter earnings of 74 cents to 77 cents a share, including Golf Galaxy's results. The company also said it expects comparable store sales during the second-quarter to increase between about 2 percent and 4 percent. The estimate excludes Golf Galaxy, which will be included in company-wide comparable store sales totals beginning in the second-quarter of 2008. Dick's also stood by its full-year earnings forecast of $2.37 and $2.40 a share. It sees full-year comparable store sales increasing by about 1 percent or 2 percent. Shares of Dick's, which have risen about 7.7 percent since its February 13 purchase of Golf Galaxy, climbed $1.42 to $55.57 in early-afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
