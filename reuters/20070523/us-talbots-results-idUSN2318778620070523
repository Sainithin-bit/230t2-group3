 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Women's apparel retailer Talbots Inc. TLB.N posted a better-than-expected profit on Wednesday, after warning last month that weak sales in April would cause earnings to decline sharply. 

 The company, whose shares rose 4 percent, said net income for the first quarter that ended May 5 tumbled to $5.2 million, or 10 cents per share, from $27.4 million, or 51 cents per share, a year earlier. Analysts on average had been expecting 9 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates, after the retailer slashed its profit forecast to a range of 7 cents to 11 cents per share, citing adverse weather in April, the impact of an earlier Easter this year and a weak response to the casual merchandise at its namesake chain. Excluding costs associated with its acquisition last year of retailer J. Jill, the company earned 23 cents per share. Total first-quarter sales rose nearly 27 percent to $573.6 million, helped by the J. Jill purchase. But total same-store sales -- a key retail metric measuring sales at established stores -- fell 3.5 percent in the quarter. Same-store sales fell 3.9 percent at Talbots and 1.2 percent at J. Jill. The Hingham, Massachusetts-based company said it was able to make adjustments to its late spring deliveries at J. Jill so that sales trends improved toward the quarter's end. The company, which is ramping up store events at Talbots in hopes of bringing in more shoppers, said it will wait until further into the current quarter to give a second-quarter profit and sales forecast. Talbots lowered its full-year earnings outlook to a range of 70 cents to 80 cents per share, down from its prior forecast of $1.05 to $1.15 per share. Shares of Talbots, which are trading at 18.7 times earnings estimates for the current year, rose 84 cents to $22 on the New York Stock Exchange.
