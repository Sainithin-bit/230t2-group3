 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - China needs to take stronger action to crack down on piracy and counterfeiting of U.S. goods and open its markets to more American exports and services, U.S. officials said on Wednesday. 

 "The Chinese have passed tougher laws (against piracy and counterfeiting). Now is the time for tough enforcement of those laws," U.S. Commerce Secretary Carlos Gutierrez told reporters after high-level meetings with Chinese officials. "We also need better market access across the range of industries," Gutierrez said. U.S. Trade Representative Susan Schwab said the two sides discussed a range of issues, from China's role in the Doha round of world trade talks to U.S. concerns about Beijing honoring its current World Trade Organization commitments to China's current closed market for U.S. beef. "Suffice it to say we had a healthy exchange of views," Schwab told reporters. China did agree during the two-day "strategic economic dialogue" to allow foreign financial services firms to expand operations in its market. Beijing agreed to remove a bar on new foreign securities firms and resume licensing securities companies in the second half of 2007, and also agreed to allow foreign securities firms to expand operations in China to include brokerage, proprietary trading and fund management, the U.S. Treasury Department said on Wednesday. The United States and China also reached a new aviation services agreement that would more than double the number of passenger flights between the two countries by 2012. The United States will designate three additional passenger carriers to fly to China -- one in 2007 and two in 2009. Despite those and other achievements from this week's meetings, U.S. officials it was important China do more to stop piracy and counterfeiting that costs American companies billions of dollars in lost sales every year. China needs to strengthen its enforcement "for the Chinese economy to develop and to put the bilateral trading relationship on a more stable footing," Schwab said. But Schwab also noted China's decision last year to require Chinese computer manufacturers to preload legitimate software has helped reduce business software piracy. Meanwhile, Chinese officials raised concerns about a recent U.S. policy change that allows the Commerce Department to impose duties on subsidized Chinese goods, even though China is still classified as a non-market economy under U.S. trade law. "We listened to Chinese concerns about our recent decision to apply countervailing duties and confirmed our position and our firm commitment to use tools at our disposal to enforce fair competition," Gutierrez said.
