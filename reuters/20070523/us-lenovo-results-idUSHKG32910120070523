 HONG KONG  (Reuters) - Lenovo Group Ltd., which has slipped a notch to fourth among global PC makers, returned to the black in its fiscal fourth quarter after turning round its U.S. arm, but faces a competitive year. 

 Lenovo, which in 2005 bought out IBM's PC division for $1.25 billion, will now grapple with a galvanised Acer Inc., which replaced the Chinese firm as the world's third-largest PC maker in the January-March quarter. And it might have to wage a price war with Dell, which introduced a PC for as little as 2,599 yuan ($340) in the world's second-largest PC market, Lenovo's home turf. China's premier PC vendor, whose underperforming Japanese and U.S. arms had taken the shine off a robust home market it dominates, posted a net profit of US$60 million from January to March, compared with a loss of US$116 million a year earlier. Lenovo enjoyed lower overhaul expenses and over 17 percent growth in worldwide shipments in the quarter, outpacing an industry average of about 11 percent. Chairman Yang Yuanqing said its U.S. business had turned around and become profitable. Its quarterly result beat an average forecast of US$28.8 million from 16 analysts polled by Reuters Estimates. "It was a solid quarter and strong fiscal year by any number of measures," Yang said.

Shares in Lenovo, one of a handful of Chinese companies trying to craft a global brand, shed nearly a 10th of their value from January to March, while the market lost 0.8 percent and Taiwan's Acer slipped 7 percent. But the stock still trades at 26 times estimated earnings, versus Acer's 12 and the 17 achieved by global leader Hewlett Packard, according to Reuters data. Lenovo has struggled to make headway outside the region and has been saddled with expenses arising from lay-offs and corporate streamlining after its purchase of IBM's PC arm. It will book $50-$60 million in costs in the first quarter of 2007/08 for firing 1,400 workers and shifting jobs to lower-cost countries in a bid to save $100 million this year. Lenovo had posted its strongest quarterly earnings growth in the fiscal third quarter ended December, as it cemented Asian market share and held costs down. At home, it commands two-thirds of the market. In the fourth quarter, it expanded revenue there by 13 percent to US$1.2 billion, equivalent to more than a third of total turnover. But it has been ceding global market share, according to some estimates. In the January-March quarter, the firm's market share slipped to 6.3 percent from 7.1 percent in the previous quarter, according to IT consultancy Gartner. Analyst said in the fourth quarter it mis-timed the release of Microsoft's Vista operating system, allowing an aggressive Acer to move in on the U.S. corporate market at the expense of Dell Inc.. Analysts say it has its work cut out to get to grips with uninspired product design, and lack of distribution channels and international experience, but Yang remained upbeat. "Our performance confirms we have not only stabilised our business worldwide, but also that our focus on transactional business and emerging markets is beginning to reap very positive results."
