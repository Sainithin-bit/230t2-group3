 MONTREAL  (Reuters) - Alcan Inc. AL.TO( AL.N ) shares rose strongly on Wednesday on speculation a counter- offer could emerge to Alcoa Inc.'s ( AA.N ) $28.4 billion hostile bid for the big Canadian aluminum maker. 

 Alcan stock rose C$4.28 to a new high of C$92.50 on the Toronto Stock Exchange and $4.86 to $85.89 on the New York Stock Exchange. John Redstone, analyst at Desjardins Securities, thinks there is a 50 percent chance of a counter-bid for Alcan, especially as Alcoa's May 7 offer would likely take several months to gain approval from anti-trust authorities. "A lengthy delay of this deal would grant another company sufficient time to review its options and launch a counter- bid," he wrote in a research report. Alcoa reaffirmed its offer after North American markets closed on Wednesday. "We are prepared to move forward as quickly as possible to address the remaining conditions to our offer," Alain Belda, chief executive of Alcoa, said in a statement. "We have an aggressive, well-developed plan that recognizes and eliminates potential competitive overlaps and we are confident that we can effectively resolve any regulatory issues." Alcoa expects to extend its offer for Alcan, which expires on July 10, from time to time to accommodate the longer period needed to fulfill the offer's conditions. Alcoa added it has begun discussions on its proposal with anti-trust authorities in the United States, Canada and Europe. The Globe and Mail newspaper said on Wednesday that Alcan was in talks with BHP Billiton Plc ( BLT.L ) as part of its plan to consider alternatives to the Alcoa bid. A spokeswoman for BHP Billiton, whose U.S.-listed shares rose $1.01, or 2 percent, to $51.76 in New York, declined to comment. Alcan officials would not respond to questions about market speculation, but Alcan Chief Executive Dick Evans has acknowledged the company is looking at all alternatives and is talking with others. ALCAN TRADES WELL ABOVE BID Sources familiar with the matter said Alcan is likely to encourage counter offers, but it is too early to pick a favorite in any auction for the Montreal-based company. Among potential counter bidders are Xstrata Plc XTA.L, BHP, Rio Tinto Ltd.( RIO.AX ) and Anglo American Plc ( AAL.L ), banking sources added. Alcoa shares rose $1.42, or 3.6 percent, to close at $40.37 in New York. Alcan's shares ended trading in New York some 14 percent above Alcoa's cash-and-stock offer of $75.18 a share. Alcoa was offering $58.60 a share plus 0.4108 of its shares, for Alcan. In Alcan's filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rejecting Alcoa's offer, the Canadian company said it had 369,045,969 common shares outstanding as of May 17 and options to purchase an additional 8,581,805 shares. Alcoa says it has offered a good price, but Alcan says the bid is inadequate and subject to too many conditions. Those include satisfying Alcan's commitments to the Quebec government on keeping its head office in Montreal and reinvesting heavily in the mainly French-speaking province. Alcan profits have been rising over the past few years along with aluminum prices and it has a line of bauxite, alumina and aluminum production expansion projects underway that analysts expect will add to earnings. Yet some analysts think the company ought to consider diversifying into other metals. Evans previously acknowledged that Alcan considered making a bid for Canadian nickel miner Inco, which was subsequently bought by Brazil's Companhia Vale do Rio Doce ( VALE5.SA ) (CVRD) but found the acquisition price too high.
