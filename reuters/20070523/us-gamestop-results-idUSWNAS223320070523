 (Reuters) - GameStop Corp.( GME.N ), the biggest U.S. video game retailer, said its quarterly profit more than doubled, boosted by strong hardware sales. 

 The Grapevine, Texas-based retailer's net income rose to $24.7 million, or 15 cents a share, from $11.7 million, or 7 cents a share, in the year-ago quarter. Analysts had expected a profit of 16 cents a share, excluding items, according to Reuters Estimates. (Reporting by Deepti Chaudhary in Bangalore)
