 (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury Department on Wednesday announced a series of reforms that it said China had committed to during the second round of the U.S.-China "strategic economic dialogue," or SED. 

 Following are highlights of the commitments and agreements reached, according to a fact sheet distributed by Treasury: FINANCIAL SERVICES -- China will lift a freeze on the entry of new foreign securities firms and resume licensing securities companies, including joint ventures, during the second half of 2007. -- China will announce before the next round of the SED later this year that foreign securities firms can expand their operations in China to include brokerage, proprietary trading and fund management. -- China will raise the quota for its Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor scheme to $30 billion from $10 billion. The scheme allows qualifying institutions access to the domestic yuan-denominated "A-share" stock market. -- Regarding applications by foreign property insurance companies to convert from branch to subsidiary, China's insurance regulators will decide by August 1, 2007, on applications that have been pending for more than a year. In the future, it commits to abide by regulations that require such applications to be processed within 60 days. -- China will immediately allow foreign-invested banks to offer their own brand of yuan-denominated credit and debit cards. -- China agreed, by the time of the next round of the SED, to streamline the application and licensing process for the provision of enterprise annuities by financial institutions. AVIATION, TRAVEL -- The two countries agreed to double daily passenger flights from the United States to China by 2012, starting with the addition of a new daily flight this year. -- They agreed to lift, by 2011, all government-set limits on the number of cargo flights and cargo carriers serving the two countries. -- They will resume negotiations in 2010 to fix a timetable for achieving full liberalization in aviation. -- They signed a declaration of intent to launch negotiations to facilitate Chinese group leisure travel to the United States. ENERGY, ENVIRONMENT: -- Over the next five years, the two countries will develop up to 15 large-scale coal-mine methane capture and utilization projects in China. -- Both countries will create policy incentives to promote the commercialization of advanced coal technologies, while advancing the commercial use of carbon capture and storage technologies. -- They agreed to work together as part of the Doha round of world trade negotiations to discuss reducing or eliminating tariff and non-tariff barriers to environmental goods and services.
