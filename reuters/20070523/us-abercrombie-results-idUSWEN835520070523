 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Apparel retailer Abercrombie & Fitch Co. ( ANF.N ) said on Wednesday its quarterly profit rose due to higher sales at its namesake, Hollister and RUEHL chains. 

 First-quarter net income climbed to $60.1 million, or 65 cents a share, from $56.2 million or 62 cents a share a year earlier.
