 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Women's apparel retailer Talbots Inc. TLB.N said on Wednesday that quarterly net profit fell sharply due to significantly weaker-than-expected sales in April. 

 First-quarter net income was $5.2 million, or 10 cents per share, compared with $27.4 million, or 51 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding costs associated with its acquisition of J. Jill, the company earned 23 cents per share.
