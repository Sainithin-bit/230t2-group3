 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Foot Locker Inc. ( FL.N ) said on Wednesday its quarterly net profit fell sharply as markdowns at stores in the United States and a decline in sales at established stores hit results. 

 The largest retailer of athletic shoes and apparel said its first-quarter net income was $17 million, or 11 cents per share, compared with $59 million, or 38 cents per share, a year earlier, the company said. Net sales slipped 3.6 percent to about $1.32 billion from about $1.4 billion a year earlier. Analysts, on average, had been expecting earnings of 11 cents on sales of $1.3 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. "Because of the disappointing sales at our U.S. stores, we increased our promotional posture to help clear older goods and reduce inventory levels," Chief Executive Matthew Serra said in a statement. "As a result, our gross margin in our U.S. store businesses fell significantly short of our plan." Foot Locker slashed its quarterly earnings outlook earlier this month, warning that sales and profit at U.S. stores fell short of expectations. Sales at established stores, a key gauge of retail performance known as same-store sales, fell 5.1 percent during the quarter. Looking ahead, Foot Locker expects second-quarter earnings to range between 15 cents and 20 cents a share, with full-year earnings ranging between $1.15 and $1.25 a share. "The forecast includes higher markdowns than last year to insure that our inventory is well positioned for the fall season," Serra said. Foot Locker shares traded down 1.9 percent at $21.82 in extended trading after closing Wednesday's New York Stock Exchange session at $22.24. The shares have traded in a 52-week range of $28 and $20.82.
