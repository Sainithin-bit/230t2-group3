 BOSTON  (Reuters) - Money manager Eaton Vance Corp. ( EV.N ) said on Wednesday its quarterly profit fell 42 percent as it spent millions to launch a closed-end stock fund that helped boost its assets under management. 

 Net income slipped to $23.1 million, or 17 cents per diluted share during the second fiscal quarter that ended April 30, from $39.9 million, or 29 cents, a year ago. The cost of launching the new fund cut earnings by 25 cents. Still, Eaton Vance's share price, which has surged more than 53 percent in the last 12 months, climbed again on Wednesday after the earnings topped Wall Street analysts' average forecast of 16 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. Eaton Vance shares were up 1.7 percent, or 71 cents, to $41.48 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. "This suggests that investors get it," Eaton Vance's chairman and chief executive James Hawkes told analysts on a conference call explaining recent moves in spite of what he called "anemic" reported earnings results. Eaton Vance, which ranks as the second-biggest U.S. manager of closed-end funds, raised $5.8 billion in February with its Tax-Managed Global Diversified Equity Income Fund. Investor appetite has boomed recently for closed-end funds, which sell a limited number of shares, invest the proceeds in securities and trade like stocks on an exchange. Roughly $13 billion has been raised in these funds since January. More launches are expected in the second half of this year and Eaton Vance is readying another fund for sale in July, Hawkes said. The fund launched in February helped Eaton Vance's assets under management reach $150 billion, marking a 26 percent increase from a year ago and an 11 percent rise from the previous quarter. During the quarter, Eaton Vance took in $10.5 billion in net new money, more than three times the amount investors added during the same quarter a year ago. Higher assets under management helped boost revenue 23 percent to $48.4 million, Eaton Vance said, noting that investment adviser and administration fees alone rose 28 percent to $185.4 million during the quarter. At the same time, however, operating expenses rose 48 percent to $223.9 million due to $54.4 million of one-time expenses related to the fund offering, higher compensation, service fees and other expenses. Generally analysts and investors accept the costs for launching closed-end funds because the money these offerings bring in tends to stick with the money manager for a long term and promises to earn stronger revenue in the future. While Eaton Vance's stock price has handily beaten its Standard & Poor's 500 benchmark index and other rivals in the last year, the share price is considered expensive and that worries some analysts. The company, long known for conservative portfolios such as its tax-managed funds, that try to minimize the taxable gains passed on to investors, is trading at roughly 30 times future earnings while the sector is trading, on average, at roughly 18 times future earnings. Rival Nuveen Investments JNC.N is the biggest manager of closed-end funds and is trading at 20 times future earnings. "Although the environment for fund launches remains favorable, Eaton Vance shares are expensive ... versus the group," Goldman Sachs analyst Marc Irizarry wrote in a note.
