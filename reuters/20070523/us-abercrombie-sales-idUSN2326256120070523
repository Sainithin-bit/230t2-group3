 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Apparel retailer Abercrombie & Fitch Co. ( ANF.N ) said on Wednesday its quarterly profit climbed 6.9 percent on higher sales at its retail chains, sending its shares up 2 percent in after-hours trading to a new yearly high. 

 First-quarter net income rose to $60.1 million, or 65 cents a share, from $56.2 million, or 62 cents a share, a year earlier. Abercrombie's net income was in line with Wall Street's expectations, but its sales fell short of the analysts' average forecast. The New Albany, Ohio-based retailer said quarterly net sales rose 13 percent, to $742.4 million. Analysts were expecting Abercrombie to earn 65 cents a share for the quarter, on about $758 million in sales, according to Reuters Estimates. Comparable store sales fell 4 percent. "Despite the difficult selling conditions that impacted most retailers during this period, we enhanced each of our brands," Chief Executive Mike Jeffries said in a statement. Net sales at Abercrombie stores rose 7 percent during the quarter, the company said. At RUEHL, sales soared 84 percent, while sales at surf-inspired Hollister increased 19 percent. Looking ahead, the company said it expects to raise the gross square footage of its stores by about 11 percent to 12 percent. Abercrombie also sees earnings for the first half of 2007 ranging between $1.47 to $1.52 a share. The low end of that forecast reflects a flat comparable store sales scenario during the second quarter, Abercrombie said. The company is also planning full-year capital expenditures of between $395 million and $405 million, with about $220 million going toward new store construction and store remodeling. Abercrombie's stock was trading up 2 percent at $82.32 after hours after closing at $80.80 on the New York Stock Exchange.
