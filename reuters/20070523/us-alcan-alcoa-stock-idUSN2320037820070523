 MONTREAL  (Reuters) - Shares of Alcan Inc. AL.TO ( AL.N ) rose some 3 percent on Wednesday morning on a report it was talking to BHP Billiton ( BHP.AX ) ( BHP.N ) as the Canadian aluminum maker opposes a hostile $28 billion bid by U.S. rival Alcoa Inc. ( AA.N ). 

 Alcan stock was up C$2.63 at C$90.85 on the Toronto Stock Exchange and $2.77 at $83.80 on the New York Stock Exchange shortly after the markets opened. The share price jump came after the Globe and Mail newspaper reported that Alcan was in talks with BHP Billiton as part of its plan to consider alternatives to the Alcoa bid. A spokeswoman for BHP Billiton, whose U.S.-listed shares were up $1.04, or 2 percent, at $51.79 in New York, declined to comment on the report. Alcoa shares rose $1.34, or 3.4 percent, to $40.29 in New York on Wednesday morning. Alcan's shares were still trading some 11.5 percent above Alcoa's cash-and-stock offer of $75.08 a share. Alcoa was offering $58.60 a share plus 0.4108 of its shares, for Alcan. On Tuesday afternoon, Alcan rejected the hostile takeover bid from Alcoa, but said it was in talks with third parties. Alcan said Alcoa's offer does not adequately reflect the value of Alcan's assets, strategic capabilities and growth prospects. Speaking to Reuters shortly after rejecting Alcoa's bid on Tuesday afternoon, Alcan Chief Executive Dick Evans said his company was in discussions with other parties, but would not say which ones. "Our board has asked us to evaluate all alternatives, both internal and external," he said. Evans would not say whether Alcan would consider trying to take over Alcoa. Alcoa responded on Tuesday that it had offered a good price for Alcan, but the big U.S. aluminum maker would not comment on its next step. "Our offer is full, fair and balanced," Alcoa chief financial officer Charles McLane told the Reuters Global Mining and Steel Summit in New York. McLane declined to comment on specifics of the rejection until he could review it with fellow Alcoa executives. ($1=$1.08 Canadian)
