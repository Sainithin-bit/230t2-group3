 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Teen retailer Wet Seal Inc. WTSLA.O posted a  better-than-expected profit on Wednesday as it reined in inventories and expenses, and its shares rose 5 percent. 

 Net income was $7.6 million, or 7 cents per share, in the company's first quarter, which ended on May 5, versus a loss of $14.0 million, or 22 cents, a year earlier -- when debt-related charges and stock-compensation costs hurt results. Analysts, on average, expected it to earn 6 cents a share according to Reuters Estimates. Its shares rose 28 cents to $5.86 in early Nasdaq trading. For the second quarter, Foothill Ranch, California-based Wet Seal said it expected to earn between 5 and 8 cents per share. Analysts forecast 9 cents a share. The company also said it expected same-store sales in May and the fiscal second quarter to rise in the low-single-digit range. Same-store sales are a measure of retail strength and track sales at stores open at least one year. Sales during the first quarter rose 10 percent to $138 million. Same-store sales during the same period increased 2.7 percent. Earlier in the week, the company said Chief Executive Joel Waller would step down on February 1, 2008 and that it had begun looking for his successor. The company opened 18 net new stores in the quarter, bringing its total to 448 -- comprised of 356 Wet Seal stores and 92 Arden B stores.
