 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Amgen Inc. ( AMGN.O ) has received a subpoena from the New York state attorney general related to promotional, sales and marketing activities and other issues, according to a filing late on Tuesday. 

 The biotechnology company received the subpoena on May 10, and intends to fully cooperate in responding to it, the company said in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Amgen also said the U.S. Senate Finance Committee sent a letter to the company on May 16 requesting a briefing to discuss the issues and concerns reported in the media related to the marketing and safety of erythropoiesis stimulating agents.
