 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Boeing's ( BA.N ) arms chief warned on Wednesday against cutting U.S. military spending to create a "peace dividend", and said Congressional moves to scale back funding for one of the company's high-profile programs could eat into sales for this year and next. 

 Boeing, the Pentagon's No. 2 supplier, will get about half of its $65 billion revenue this year from its defense unit, which makes jet fighters, missiles, satellites and a range of military electronics. It is also the lead contractor on the Future Combat Systems program -- a $200 billion push to turn the U.S. Army into a mobile, electronically linked force -- which Democrat-controlled Congress is looking to prune. "We've got a change of leadership on Capitol Hill right now, they have different priorities, and there's even talk of a peace dividend," said James Albaugh, head of Boeing's defense unit, at the company's annual investor day. That "would be clearly the wrong thing to do with the aging equipment we have and also the different threats that are out there that weren't out there the last time a peace dividend was achieved," he said in a presentation that was broadcast over the Internet from Chicago. After the collapse of the Soviet Bloc in the late 1980s and early 1990s -- which effectively ended the Cold War -- U.S. military spending dropped sharply, producing what some called a "peace dividend," as money previously earmarked for defense was used to reduce budget deficits. Albaugh said the last such period was possible because U.S. forces had new equipment at the time. "We have not replaced much of this equipment since the 1980s and the 1990s, and of course the obsolescence is being accelerated by all the use it is seeing over in Iraq and Afghanistan," said Albaugh. That means a massive bill for repairing war-torn equipment and returning U.S. forces to full strength, he added. FEELING THE PINCH Boeing, along with rivals Lockheed Martin Corp. ( LMT.N ) and Northrop Grumman Corp. ( NOC.N ), is already feeling the pinch from Democrat-controlled Congress, which is seeking to trim military spending and hasten withdrawal from Iraq. Earlier this month, the U.S. House of Representatives Armed Services Committee voted to slash $867 million from the proposed 2008 budget for Future Combat Systems, the U.S. Army's top modernization project. The cut would represent one-quarter of President George W. Bush's request for the program for fiscal year 2008, which starts in October. The issue has yet to be decided by the full House and Senate. Boeing is the largest contractor on Future Combat Systems, followed by Science Applications International Corp. SAI.N and others. "If there is truly going to be an $867 million cut to Future Combat Systems in 2008, we're going to have to be making some decisions in the fourth quarter of the government's fiscal year, which is going to be in the September, October timeframe," said Albaugh. "Those hits will hit us in October, November and you'll see us doing some scrambling," said Albaugh. Boeing is lobbying Congress to prevent funding cuts on Future Combat Systems, and Albaugh said the company was getting some "traction" in Washington. "But if they do cut it, it'll be an impact to our revenues in 2008," he added.
