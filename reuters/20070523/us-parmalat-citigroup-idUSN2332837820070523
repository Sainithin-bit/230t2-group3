 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Parmalat SpA ( PLT.MI ) on Wednesday said New Jersey's highest court rejected Citigroup Inc.'s ( C.N ) attempt to dismiss its $10 billion lawsuit accusing the largest U.S. bank of helping former management commit fraud. 

 Parmalat, an Italian company best known for its long-life milk, said the state supreme court rejected Citigroup's appeal of a January ruling by Bergen County Superior Court Judge Jonathan Harris. The judge had turned aside Citigroup's argument that Parmalat brought the case in the wrong court. Parmalat Chief Executive Enrico Bondi has accused some 50 defendants, including Citigroup, of helping prior management hide debt and inflate results, leading in 2003 to Europe's largest bankruptcy. Much of the resulting litigation is being handled in Italy and a Manhattan federal court. Citigroup spokesman Daniel Noonan said the bank was disappointed with the latest ruling, but noted it does not address the merits of Bondi's case. "Citigroup has done nothing wrong, and we look forward to being vindicated," Noonan said. A copy of the appellate ruling was not immediately available. Citigroup had argued that New Jersey was not equipped to deal with the case, did not have key witnesses and documents, and should not be forced to interpret Italian law. A Parmalat unit, Farmland Dairies, had been located in Wallington, New Jersey. Bondi has obtained more than $700 million in settlements. He is also suing Bank of America Corp. ( BAC.N ) and the accounting firm Grant Thornton International for $10 billion each, both in Manhattan federal court. Another accountant, Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, settled a similar lawsuit in January for about $149 million.
