 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said on Wednesday he pressed China to take measures in the short term to increase flexibility in its yuan currency and a market-set exchange rate in the medium term. 

 "The Chinese have taken some steps to increase the flexibility of their exchange rate. In our meetings, I pressed for greater flexibility in the short term and for a transition for a market-determined exchange rate in the medium term," Paulson said at a news conference at the close of two days of high-level U.S.-China talks.
