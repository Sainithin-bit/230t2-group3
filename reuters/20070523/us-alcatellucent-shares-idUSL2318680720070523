 PARIS  (Reuters) - Shares in Alcatel-Lucent ALU.PA rose more than 2 percent after the French American telecoms equipment group, hit by merger disruptions and costs, reassured investors its restructuring and integration were on track. 

 "The company indicated restructuring efforts remain on track," Prudential Equity Group said in a research note. "Alcatel-Lucent's order book continues to improve following intense effort in the first quarter to bring clarity to the company's salesforce and customer base," it added. The shares were up 2.76 percent at 10.41 euros by 0924 GMT on Wednesday, the top gainer on France's benchmark CAC-40 index   .FCHI . Alcatel of France and Lucent of the United States started operating as a combined entity in December but the merger has created uncertainty about the future of the companies' products and led some customers to delay long-term investment decisions. In April, the group warned a revenue drop in the first quarter had been wider than expected. The company kicked off a four-day road show on Tuesday to update investors on its merger progress and prospects.
