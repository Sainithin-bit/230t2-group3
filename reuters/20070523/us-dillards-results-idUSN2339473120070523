 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Department store chain Dillard's Inc. ( DDS.N ) posted a 30 percent drop in first-quarter profit on Wednesday as sales declined, sending shares down more than 4 percent. 

 Net profit fell to $42.9 million, or 53 cents a share, from $61.3 million, or 77 cents a share, a year earlier. The latest earnings included a pre-tax $4.1 million hurricane recovery gain, which added 3 cents to earnings after tax. Analysts were expecting 72 cents per share excluding the recovery gain, according to Reuters Estimates. "Dillard's is slipping deeper into a strategic bind, due to its eroding sales," wrote Oppenheimer & Co. analyst Bernard Sosnick in a research note. With Macy's becoming the first national chain of department stores last year, and given its "much greater sales and negotiating power" compared to Dillard's, "increasingly it will face Macy's strategic might," Sosnick wrote. He said the struggling former May stores, which are expected to improve over time, would impact Dillard's Texas stores and other strongholds in the Western region. NET SALES Net sales fell 4 percent to $1.76 billion during the quarter, dragged down by weak sales of juniors' and childrens' clothing. Sales were strongest in the Western region. Analysts had been expecting Dillard's to post net sales of $1.84 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. Sales at stores open at least a year fell 5 percent during the quarter. The company had earlier reported that April same-store sales declined 14 percent, hurt by an earlier Easter holiday. Dillard's shares were down $1.75 to $37.90 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
