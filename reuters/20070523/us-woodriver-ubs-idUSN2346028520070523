 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Investors in Wood River Partners have sued UBS AG ( UBSN.VX ), alleging the defunct hedge fund's prime broker fraudulently earned more than $100 million by misusing knowledge of its trades, the Wall Street Journal reported on its Web site on Wednesday. 

 The plaintiffs, who collectively invested $79 million in Wood River, allege in the lawsuit filed in a New York state court that UBS earned profits by selling borrowed shares in the fund's biggest single stock holding, Endwave Corp. ENWV.O, and helping other UBS clients do the same, the paper said. The lawsuit claimed $200 million in damages, the paper said. UBS could not be reached immediately. But the Journal quoted a spokeswoman as saying: "UBS intends to defend itself vigorously against these allegations." Wood River collapsed in late 2005. Earlier this year, U.S. authorities charged its founder, John Whittier, with defrauding investors out of $88 million. Whittier has pleaded not guilty to the charges. Prosecutors have said Whittier, the former co-head of media and telecoms equity research at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, amassed an 80 percent stake in Endwave, a small California telecoms company, between 2004 and 2005, but failed to disclose the holding either to investors or to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
