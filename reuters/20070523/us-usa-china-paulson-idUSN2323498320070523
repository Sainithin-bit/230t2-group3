 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury officials pressed the Chinese officials this week for greater currency flexibility and to open the country's financial services sector but ran into resistance on both fronts, officials said on Wednesday. 

 U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, closing two days of high-level economic talks here, said Chinese officials recognize the need for more flexibility in the yuan currency but there were differences on the pace of change. "The Chinese clearly see the need, and have stated the principle of greater renminbi flexibility," Paulson told a news conference. "They agree with us on principle. The question is the pace of change," he said. Paulson said he pressed Chinese officials, led by Vice Premier Wu Yi, for greater currency flexibility in the short term as a transition toward a fully market-determined exchange rate in the medium term. Although China agreed to lift a moratorium on new foreign securities joint ventures and to expand their services, it did not budge on key U.S. requests to lift foreign ownership caps on Chinese commercial banks, asset managers, securities firms and insurers. Paulson characterized the financial services discussions as producing "some progress," but said Beijing and Washington also differed over the pace of reforms in this area. "I believe that the greater risk for China is in moving too slowly, not in moving too quickly," he said. China currently has ownership caps of about 20 percent for commercial banks, 49 percent for asset management firms and 33 percent for securities firms. A senior Treasury official said Chinese officials expressed reluctance to move beyond their World Trade Organization commitments on ownership limits. He said U.S. officials tried to persuade them that increased foreign competition in financial services would help them to more quickly develop a balanced economy, with increased domestic consumption that would ease trade imbalances. Instead, China agreed to immediately allow foreign-invested banks, including U.S. banks, to offer their own brand of yuan-denominated credit and debit cards and will complete decisions on pending applications for U.S. non-life insurers by August 1. In addition to approving licenses for more new securities joint ventures, the Treasury said China agreed to announce within the next six months that these firms would be allowed to expand their operations in China to include brokerage, proprietary trading and fund management. But the timing on when this would occur was not specific. Qualified foreign institutional investors will be allowed to increase their investments in yuan-denominated assets, such as domestic "A-shares" to $30 billion from a current ceiling, or quota, of $10 billion. The two sides also agreed to make it easier for investors in China to invest outside the country. The biggest development in currencies and financial services came Friday, before the Sino-U.S. talks started, when China announced a widening of the yuan's trading band to a 0.5 percent variance against the dollar from 0.3 percent. China has not fully utilized the smaller band, but Paulson said he was hopeful for more flexibility. "I choose to take that as a positive signal. The real test will be how much flexibility there is in the renminbi on a daily basis and over time." he said.
