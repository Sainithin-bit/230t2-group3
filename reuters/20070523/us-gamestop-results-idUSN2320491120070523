 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - GameStop Corp.( GME.N ), the biggest U.S. video game retailer, said its quarterly profit more than doubled, boosted by strong sales of interactive video game consoles. 

 The Grapevine, Texas-based retailer's net income rose to $24.7 million, or 15 cents a share, from $11.7 million, or 7 cents a share, in the year-ago quarter. Excluding one-time costs, the company posted a profit of 18 cents a share, beating Wall Street expectations of a profit of 16 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Sales increased 23 percent to $1.28 billion, compared to $1.04 billion in the prior year quarter. Hardware sales grew 75.1 percent, driven by solid demand for Nintendo Co. Ltd.'s 7974.OS Wii gaming console and DS Lite handheld system, Microsoft Corp.'s( MSFT.O ) Xbox 360 and Sony Corp.'s ( 6758.T ) PlayStation 3. The Wii and PS3 went on sale in the U.S. just ahead of the holiday season, and about one year after the Xbox 360. GameStop added that the results were driven by demand for games from Nintendo, Sony, Activision ( ATVI.O ), Microsoft and UbiSoft ( UBIP.PA ). Looking ahead, the company said it expects earnings per share in a range of 7 cents to 8 cents for the second quarter, and $1.39 to $1.42 for the full year. Total revenues growth is seen between 19 percent and 21 percent. According to Reuters Estimates, analysts on an average are expecting the Company to report a profit of $0.08 for second quarter 2007, on revenue of $6.41 billion.
