 (Reuters) - Alcoa Inc. ( AA.N ) on Wednesday reaffirmed its offer to acquire rival Alcan Inc. AL.TO ( AL.N ), a day after the Canadian aluminium producer rejected the unsolicited bid and said it was in talks with third parties. 

 Alcoa, which had offered $58.60 a share plus 0.4108 of its shares, said it has started discussions with competition authorities in the United States, Canada and Europe. (Reporting by Saumyadeb Chakrabarty in Bangalore)
