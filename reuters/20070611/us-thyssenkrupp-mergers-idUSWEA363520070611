 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - German steelmaker ThyssenKrupp ( TKAG.DE ) is not holding merger or cooperation talks with either U.S. Steel Corp ( X.N ) or Severstal ( CHMF.MM ), a ThyssenKrupp spokesman said on Monday, denying a media report to that effect. 

 "There are no talks about merger or cooperation. Reports to this effect are false and inaccurate," he said. Severstal's chief executive, Alexei Mordashov, had also on Saturday denied the report by the Interfax news agency, which on Friday cited an unidentified source as saying that ThyssenKrupp was in discussions to take over Severstal or U.S. Steel. ThyssenKrupp's shares extended gains after the news and were up 3.3 percent at 43.90 euros by 0738 GMT, the leading gainer in the German blue chip index  .GDAXI . Severstal shares were up 1.7 percent at 335.58 roubles. U.S. Steel shares rose 8 percent on Friday to close at $125.05.
