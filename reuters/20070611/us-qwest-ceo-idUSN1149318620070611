 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Qwest Communications International Inc. ( Q.N ) CEO Richard Notebaert said on Monday he plans to retire as soon as a replacement can be found, sending the company's shares down almost 6 percent. 

 Analysts said the news raised questions about how Qwest would handle issues such as whether to seek a merger as competition from cable television providers increases. "The time has come for me to spend more time with family and focus on other commitments," 59-year-old Notebaert said in a statement. He said he was looking forward to working closely with the Qwest Board in its search for a replacement. Notebaert has been chairman and chief executive of Qwest since June 2002. He and Chief Financial Officer Oren Shaffer were credited with helping the company past massive debt after the technology bubble burst and an accounting scandal. Shaffer retired on April 1. "I am surprised that he's stepping down so soon after Oren Shaffer," said Janco Partners analyst Donna Jaegers. She said Qwest's financial results were showing improvement, but the company had yet to decide whether to invest in advanced video services to compete with cable and what to do about out-of-region services that are not doing well. Qwest mainly serves the U.S. Midwest. "The next person has a lot on their plate," Jaegers said. Qwest said it did not plan to change its business strategy as a result of Notebaert's retirement and that it had set no timetable for naming a new chairman and CEO. A.G. Edwards analyst Kent Custer said the departures appeared orderly, with the executives leaving after reviving the company. "Right now is a good time to step aside and let the next leaders make the decisions rather than setting the decisions and then stepping aside," he said. In April, Notebaert's predecessor, Joseph Nacchio, was found guilty of insider trading stemming from a 2002 investigation by federal prosecutors and securities regulators after Qwest restated $2.2 billion in revenue for the preceding two years. Qwest shares, which more than doubled over the past 5 years, are up about 20 percent so far this year. However, the company is seen as the weakest of the former "Baby Bells" and is particularly vulnerable to growing competition from cable companies and declining sales of traditional phone services. Unlike industry leader AT&T Inc. ( T.N ) and No. 2 carrier Verizon Communications Inc. ( VZ.N ), Qwest does not have a wireless service. Also, its territory, which includes Arizona, Colorado, and Wyoming, is seen as more difficult and costly to maintain and deploy new services. Some analysts have said Qwest might be looking for a merger or a buyout. Notebaert is due to speak later on Monday at a Bear Stearns technology conference. Before joining Qwest, Notebaert was president and chief executive of communications equipment company Tellabs Inc. ( TLAB.O ) He also worked for Ameritech Corp. for 30 years. Qwest shares were down 57 cents at $9.60 on the New York Stock Exchange trade.
