 LONDON  (Reuters) - Britain's Rexam Plc ( REX.L ) said on Monday it had agreed to buy OI Plastic Products from Owens-Illinois Inc ( OI.N ) for $1.83 billion and said it would place 58.35 million new shares to fund the acquisition. 

 The world's biggest can maker, which said on Friday that it was in talks with Owens-Illinois, said the acquisition was expected to meet its cost of capital in 2009 based on the effective cost of $1.57 billion and to be modestly earnings enhancing in 2008.
