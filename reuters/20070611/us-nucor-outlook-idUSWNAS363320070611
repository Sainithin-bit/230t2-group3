 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Steelmaker Nucor Corp. ( NUE.N ) said on Monday it expects second-quarter earnings to be well below Wall Street expectations, hurt by weak demand from the automotive and residential construction sectors. 

 The earnings warning sent Nucor shares down almost 7 percent before recovering slightly and drove other U.S. steel stocks lower. Nucor said it expects second-quarter earnings of $1.05 to $1.15 per share. Analysts, on average, were expecting $1.39, according to Reuters Estimates. The softness in the sectors, coupled with customers who built inventories in anticipation of higher prices in the second quarter, is expected to drove down results for both Nucor's sheet and bar products. "This is a good indicator that the rest of the industry is going top face similar results," said Michael Locker, of steel consulting firm Locker Associates, noting that Nucor has 20 to 25 percent market share in a number of products. Nucor said it was unable to push through price increases for its sheet steel due to the soft demand and surging imports from China, resulting in lower margins during the quarter. Locker said Nucor's difficulties were mirrored throughout the industry where some flat-rolled products were fetching prices around 10 percent lower than steelmakers had hoped. The company also said it expects shipments of its steel bar products to drop about 17 percent from the first quarter because of the inventory buildups as well as the automotive and residential construction weakness. The company said bar shipments for the first six months of the year will be down about 5 percent from a year earlier. It expects full-year shipments to be more in line with the year-to-date pace than the second-quarter rate. Nucor shares were down $3.58, or 5.4 percent, at $63.03 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Shares of United States Steel Corp. ( X.N ) fell $7.52, or 6 percent, to $117.53 on the NYSE and Steel Dynamics Inc. ( STLD.O ) dropped $2.07, or 4.5 percent, to $43.69 on Nasdaq.
