 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Blackstone Group issued compensation details for the first time on Monday, disclosing in a filing that its co-founders will receive at least $2.33 billion after part of the firm is taken public. 

 CEO and Co-founder Stephen Schwarzman received nearly $400 million in pay last year and stands to make at least $449.2 million after the investment firm goes public. The-post IPO payout could grow to $677.2 million, the filing says. Schwarzman, 60, will own 23 percent of Blackstone after the IPO, expected in the next few weeks. Should the IPO price in the expected range of $30 per share, Schwarzman's stake would be worth $7.73 billion -- a little more than Rupert Murdoch's stake in media conglomerate News Corp.  Blackstone also said it paid co-founder Peter Peterson $213 million last year and will pay him $1.88 billion when the firm goes public. Peterson, 80, is cashing in most of his stake and keeping 4 percent. Blackstone expects to record significant net losses for a number of years after the IPO as a result of payments related to certain assets and compensation. "It's very, very rich for the founders. I think it's going to raise a lot of eyebrows. You're talking about $2 billion," said attorney Steve Howard, chairman of the investment funds group at law firm Thacher Proffitt & Wood. Howard added that the projected net loss was significant and underscored the complex tax implications within the offering. But Robert Willens, accounting and tax analyst at Lehman Brothers, said the accounting income does not give a clear picture of Blackstone's ability to generate cash. "It's the kind of expense that most analysts and most investors would ignore," Willens said. "It's not an expense that requires them to spend any cash, and so therefore most investors would not be so concerned with the accounting loss." Blackstone earns the bulk of its money through its private equity investing, buying companies with borrowed money and selling them one to five years later. It invests in public and private companies, distressed debt, hedge funds and real estate, among others. Blackstone said it would pay its president, Hamilton James, 56, at least $147.9 million after its IPO. He earned $97.3 million last year. By comparison, Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein earned $54.3 million in fiscal 2006, while JPMorgan & Co. ( JPM.N ) CEO Jamie Dimon brought in $27.5 million. The hefty earnings by Blackstone executives, while steep, still place them on par or even below certain hedge fund managers. A list of 26 hedge fund managers compiled by Institutional Investor's Alpha magazine put their average 2005 payout at $363 million. Blackstone had net income of $2.27 billion last year, up 71 percent from the prior year, according to a previous filing. The executive earnings detailed in Monday's filing are not annual salary, but reflect their economic stake in the firm and Blackstone's huge profits gained from its investment portfolio. The New York-based M&A advisory and investment company started in 1985 with $400,000 and now has $88 billion under management. Details of the executive earnings were eagerly anticipated, as Blackstone will be the first major U.S. private equity firm to go public in a hot leveraged buyout market. With frothy debt markets and a steady economy, private equity firms are experiencing one of the best investment climates ever, hauling in more than $400 billion of deals in the first half of this year alone -- more than triple the total in the year-earlier period. And Blackstone is among the most high-profile and aggressive of global private equity buyers, involved in such deals as the $22.9 billion purchase of Equity Office Properties Trust and the $17.6 billion buyout of Freescale Semiconductor, among the largest leveraged buyouts ever. Blackstone also agreed to buy Pinnacle Foods earlier this year, which owns such brands as Duncan Hines, Vlasic pickles, and Lender's bagels. In March, Blackstone filed to take 10 percent of the firm public in an IPO worth $4 billion. Last month, the firm said it would raise as much as $7.75 billion through the IPO and through a sale of a stake to the Chinese government.  Blackstone said on Monday its private equity fund had $19.6 billion in committed capital, making it the second-largest such fund behind Goldman Sachs ( GS.N ).
