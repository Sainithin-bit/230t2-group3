 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japan's economy outperformed both the United States and the euro zone in January-March for the second straight quarter, reinforcing expectations the Bank of Japan will raise rates in August. 

 The economy expanded by 0.8 percent in January-March from the previous quarter, revised up from an initial reading of 0.6 percent on robust growth in capital spending. The headline figure matched economists' forecasts, although consumption was revised down slightly from the initial reading. On an annualized basis, gross domestic product (GDP) grew 3.3 percent, up from a preliminary reading of a 2.4 percent rise, the government said on Monday. That was slightly higher than a consensus forecast for a revision to 3.1 percent. "Overall, the data confirmed the firmness of capital spending," said Takumi Tsunoda, a senior economist at Shinkin Central Bank Research. Financial markets reacted little as the figures were mostly in line with forecasts. Still, the upbeat data makes it more likely the BOJ will further raise interest rates, analysts said. Japan's January-March GDP growth compared with 0.6 percent quarter-on-quarter growth in the euro zone and an annualized 0.6 percent expansion in the United States. Largely behind the upward revision was strength in capital spending, which was marked up to a 0.3 percent rise from a preliminary 0.9 percent fall. While that was smaller than the consensus forecast of a revision to a 0.5 percent rise, it was enough to confirm the economy continues to get support from corporate sector strength. "When the preliminary data showed a fall in capital spending, people had worried about the outlook for capital spending," said Yoshiki Shinke, a senior economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute. "But this data confirmed that capital spending remained firm," he said. The economy expanded 2.1 percent in the fiscal year that ended on March 31, slower than 2.4 percent growth in the previous year but above the government forecast of 1.9 percent. The government expects Japan to achieve growth of 2.0 percent in the fiscal year that began on April 1, and a senior official at the Cabinet Office gave an upbeat assessment. "As a whole, the economy continues to recover," Jun Hamano, vice minister for policy coordination, told a news conference. He said growth in capital spending is also moving within government expectations, which is for spending to keep growing but at a slower pace than in the year that ended on March 31. Vice Finance Minister Hideto Fujii said the data was in line with the ministry's assessment that Japan's economy is continuing a long-lasting recovery and is not in deflation. CONSUMPTION REVISED DOWN Soft capital spending had been blamed for a slowdown in preliminary January-March GDP growth from the previous quarter's 1.2 percent expansion. But economists had expected the GDP figures to be revised up after a Ministry of Finance survey released last week showed that corporate capital spending in the quarter rose more than expected from a year earlier to a record high. The revised GDP data also showed personal consumption, which makes up about 55 percent of the economy, rose 0.8 percent from the previous quarter, revised down from an initial estimate of a 0.9 percent increase. Some analysts were worried whether consumption could sustain momentum in the months ahead. "Consumption could lose steam especially in July-September after the scheduled changes in taxes," said Kiichi Murashima, an economist at Nikko Citigroup, referring to a planned rise in June in the "residence" tax, an already hefty local tax. A slump in consumption in the middle of last year was a key reason for the BOJ's decision to hold off on raising its key rate in December and January, before raising it to 0.50 percent in February. The central bank is widely expected to keep rates on hold at its two-day policy meeting that ends on Friday but it has said it will raise rates gradually to keep on top of inflation. Many analysts expect the next rate rise to come sometime in the July-September quarter. Japan is currently enjoying its longest period of economic expansion in the postwar era, albeit at a slower pace than previous booms, thanks to solid exports and capital spending.
