 PARIS  (Reuters) - A senior executive at European aerospace firm EADS ( EAD.PA ) has resigned, exposing a tussle over the 25-billion-euro revenue powerhouse at subsidiary Airbus days before a showdown for plane orders with Boeing. 

 EADS strategy chief Jean-Paul Gut said he was resigning in a dispute with the company's top officials over his efforts to integrate sales, marketing and strategy -- combining his role with sales responsibilities jealously guarded by EADS units. EADS said on Monday Gut would be replaced on October 1 by Marwan Lahoud, 41, head of missiles maker MBDA in which EADS holds a stake with Britain's BAE Systems BA.L and Italy's Finmeccanica ( SIFI.MI ). Coming one week before the Paris Air Show, Gut's exit makes him the latest in a string of casualties at a group wrestling with restructuring and output delays at jetmaker Airbus and an insider trading probe, but which says recovery is in sight. EADS shares gained 1.8 percent to 22.69 euros, outperforming the market as Gut's move put an end to uncertainty over EADS appointments in the run-up to the June 18-22 air show and as both he and the firm discounted a deeper strategy dispute. Gut's exit had been an open secret for weeks, generating media excitement over the size of his pay-off which one report put at 12 million euros -- dismissed by EADS as "fantasyland". Corporate pay-off deals are a heated political issue in France after the same company's former co-CEO, Noel Forgeard, quit last summer with an 8.5 million-euro send-off, leading to government efforts to curb "golden parachute" payments. But there had previously been few clues linking Gut's impending departure to pressure to integrate EADS sales teams. Gut, 45, a former arms salesman credited with securing major Airbus deals in the Gulf, had once been touted as a future CEO. "I have had disagreements with my employer on organization," Gut, an EADS board member, said in an interview with French daily newspaper Le Figaro, adding he would receive a 2.8 million-euro ($3.8 million) payoff, much less than reported. "I am leaving now because, after months of discussions, I have not reached an agreement with (EADS co-Chief Executives) Louis Gallois and Thomas Enders on the integration of marketing, sales and strategy, which I thought was necessary to face future challenges efficiently," Gut told Le Figaro. Even though it plunged into loss last year as the result of a weak dollar and production delays on its prestigious A380 superjumbo, Airbus sales remain the lifeblood of EADS which depends on the jetmaker for two thirds of its revenues. Airbus sales come under John Leahy, an American whose tireless drive led the European planemaker from a 20 percent market share to more than 50 percent, fuelling the company's bet on the A380 before rival Boeing recovered the lead last year. A source close to Gut said he believed the weakness of the dollar had weakened EADS and Airbus to the point where they would benefit from integrated sales efforts, but that its top executives had been reluctant to centralize sales. Airbus and Boeing ( BA.N ) are gearing up for a media battle at next week's Le Bourget air show, though Boeing plays down the world's largest air show and insists it does business all year. MATRA MEN Gut said he would set up his own company to advise French companies in areas like the Middle East, China and India. Gut's departure closes one of the most colorful chapters at EADS, marking a final break with the main contingent of a group of influential high-flyers known as the "Lagardere boys". They were a quartet of successful and ambitious young executives promoted by the late Jean-Luc Lagardere, who merged his Matra missiles firm with French state-owned Aerospatiale before propelling the new entity into a partnership with German and Spanish activities to forge EADS in 2000. Quarrels within the foursome or between them and other parts of the EADS empire had written their way into European aerospace history and produced a mini-industry of EADS watchers trying to interpret their daily power struggles for outside investors. At 28, Gut had been the youngest sales director in the global defense industry while at Matra, according to a book by Jean-Louis Gergorin, another member of the same industrial clan who quit last year over his role in a political smear scandal. Gut's successor Lahoud earned his stripes at Aerospatiale. Airbus number two Fabrice Bregier is now the most prominent representative of the youthful Matra generation within EADS. His efforts to reorganize the planemaker under Gallois are seen as crucial to its survival as an all-round competitor to Boeing. The job of running Exocet-maker MBDA will go to Antoine Bouvier, CEO of Astrium Satellites, part of EADS. (Additional reporting by William Emmanuel, Jean-Michel Belot,  Jason Neely )
