 HELSINKI  (Reuters) - Nokia Oyj ( NOK1V.HE ), the world's top mobile phone maker, filed a patent counter-suit against Qualcomm Inc ( QCOM.O ) in a Texas court seeking damages and an injunction against the U.S. chip maker. 

 Nokia, which makes more than one in three of the cellphones sold globally, said on Monday it had filed a suit against Qualcomm accusing the U.S. firm of infringing six implementation patents in its MediaFLO mobile TV technology and its Brew mobile data technology. A legal dispute between the two has continued since part of a cross-licensing deal over technology patents expired on April 9, and their increasingly bitter battle is worrying investors and the industry on both sides of the Atlantic. "We see Qualcomm has copied our technology without compensating us, so we need to enforce our technologies and patents we have," Tero Ojanpera, Nokia's chief technology officer, told Reuters. Ojanpera said Nokia had a long history of innovation in the fields of IP broadcast television and mobile downloads and the U.S. firm needs its patents for the broadcast quality of MediaFLO or to download program in Brew. "We feel we have a strong case in both areas," Ojanpera said. The U.S. International Trade Commission ruled against Qualcomm in a battle with rival Broadcom Corp. ( BRCM.O ) last week, banning imports of new advanced phones using chips the ITC said infringed on Broadcom patents. Qualcomm has filed 11 patent suits against Nokia in less than two years, seeking damages and injunctions, so far without success. Last month Nokia filed its first counter-suit against Qualcomm, in Wisconsin, and related to chipset technologies. PART OF MAJOR ROW The legal dispute centers on Nokia's use of Qualcomm patents for high-speed 3G wireless technology, but it also has a bearing on Qualcomm's chips business, which Nokia says uses many Nokia-patented technologies. "We will continue to negotiate in good faith and want to resolve this as fast as possible. I think it is in everybody's interest to resolve this," Ojanpera said. Analysts estimate Nokia has paid Qualcomm about $500 million per year and wants to reduce this cost. Nokia says its patent portfolio is much stronger now than 15 years ago, when the original cross-licensing deal was signed. Industry players and analysts alike expect any agreement between the two to have a major impact on the future of 3G technologies. "This is really about setting the industry rules," Ojanpera said. Nokia also commented on a lawsuit filed by Qualcomm in Texas on April 2 and said it remains confident its products do not infringe any of three Qualcomm patents and that the patents are invalid. "Nokia is confident that the Qualcomm patents are invalid, for example, based on the alleged inventions having been patented or published by other companies, including Nokia, before Qualcomm," it said in a statement.
