 PARIS  (Reuters) - French carmaker Renault ( RENA.PA ) on Monday denied a British media report that said it was a possible bidder for Ford's ( F.N ) luxury UK car brands Jaguar and Land Rover. 

 "Of course we absolutely do not confirm this information," a Renault spokesman said. "(Chief Executive) Carlos Ghosn said last week that the acquisition of a luxury brand would bring nothing to Renault or the Nissan alliance, in the short term," he said. He was commenting following a report in London's City A.M. newspaper on Monday that said private equity firm Alchemy Partners was lining up a 3 billion-pound ($5.9 billion) bid for Land Rover and Jaguar and other possible bidders included Renault. Renault shares were 1.1 percent higher at 108.84 euros by 0840 GMT, slightly outpacing the rest of the French blue chip index  .FCHI  but broadly in line with the European car .SXAP sector.
