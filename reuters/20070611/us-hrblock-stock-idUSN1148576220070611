 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - H&R Block Inc. ( HRB.N ) shares rose as much as 5.4 percent after a UBS Investment Research analyst upgraded the largest U.S. tax preparer, and said it could be acquired after it sells its money-losing subprime mortgage unit. 

 Analyst Kelly Flynn on Monday raised her rating to "buy" from "neutral," reversing an August 2006 downgrade, and boosted her price target to $28 per share from $24. She said the Kansas City, Missouri company could be worth $30 per share if it were acquired by a private equity firm or if it significantly changed its strategy, such as by closing its banking unit. Flynn estimated a 40 percent chance of a leveraged buyout at $27 to $33 per share. H&R Block spokesman Ron Iori said: "It's not surprising that we would be mentioned because there is so much merger and acquisition activity out there right now. Our plan is to create long-term value for shareholders." The company in April agreed to sell its Option One Mortgage Corp. subprime unit, which makes home loans to people with poor credit, to private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management LP by the end of October. H&R Block had hoped to fetch $1.3 billion for the unit, but analysts said the final price, dependent upon the unit's value when the sale closes, might be well below $1 billion. Subprime lenders have struggled with falling volumes and rising defaults. Flynn wrote that H&R Block has other options. "A significant strategy change, including closure of (the) bank, could (give) H&R Block flexibility to add leverage to repurchase more shares," she wrote. "(The mortgage sale) may place more pressure on management to make changes, as H&R Block's activist-type investors may see more obvious 'fix it' opportunities with H&R Block's remaining businesses." Last month, H&R Block said it collected $2.54 billion of tax preparation and related fees in the main U.S. tax filing season, 6.6 percent more than a year earlier. Smaller rival Jackson Hewitt Tax Service Inc. JTX.N is addressing U.S. Department of Justice lawsuits and an Internal Revenue Service probe into allegations that some offices helped tax filers cheat the government out of more than $70 million. Including Flynn, five of nine analysts who cover H&R Block rate it "buy" or the equivalent, while four rate it "hold," according to Reuters Estimates. In early-afternoon trading, H&R Block shares were up $1.03, or 4.6 percent, at $23.55 on the New York Stock Exchange, after earlier rising to $23.74.
