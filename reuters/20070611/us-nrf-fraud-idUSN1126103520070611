 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Retail theft and fraud cost U.S. retailers a record $41.6 billion last year, although the percent of sales the industry lost through activities like organized crime and employee theft remained almost flat, according to a survey released on Monday. 

 The National Retail Security Survey, conducted by the National Retail Federation and University of Florida, found that total retail losses increased to $41.6 billion in 2006 from $37.5 billion in 2005 as overall retail sales rose. Retail shrinkage -- which measures inventory losses due to employee theft, shoplifting, organized retail crime, administrative error and vendor fraud -- averaged 1.61 percent of retail sales last year, which was nearly unchanged from 1.60 percent in 2005. "The fact that we haven't brought the number down is concerning because frankly we've invested a lot of resources in this and we've got law enforcement really active," said Joe LaRocca, NRF's Vice President of Loss Prevention. "A flat number is nothing to be excited about," he said of the retail shrinkage figure. The NRF said one big culprit behind the losses is organized retail crime, which happens when groups of shoplifters steal vast quantities of goods and typically resell them on Web sites, at flea markets or in other stores. Earlier this year, the NRF and the Retail Industry Leaders Association teamed up with the Federal Bureau of Investigation to launch a central database designed to track and share data on organized shoplifting to help law enforcement spot and stop such crimes. The survey released on Monday found the major culprit behind retail shrinkage was store employees, with employee theft totaling $19.5 billion, or 47 percent of the losses. Shoplifting accounted for $13.3 billion, or about one-third of losses. Other losses included administrative error, at $5.8 billion, and vendor fraud, at $1.7 billion. The NRF said organized retail crime spread across many of those categories, including employee theft. Product categories that experienced the highest degrees of shrinkage were cards, gifts and novelties; specialty accessories; crafts and hobbies; and supermarket and grocery items. The study surveyed 139 retailers the first half of 2007 and uses data from 2006.
