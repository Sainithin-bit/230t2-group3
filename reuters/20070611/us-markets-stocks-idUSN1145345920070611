 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. stocks ended little changed on Monday as rising oil prices boosted the energy sector but lingering concern about higher interest rates kept investors on the defensive. 

 Exxon Mobil Corp. ( XOM.N ) helped lead the Standard & Poor's 500 index  .SPX  higher as oil prices rose nearly 2 percent on news Saudi Arabia will keep OPEC supply limits in place through July. Interest-rate worries carried over from last week, when a spike in benchmark U.S. Treasury bond yields reached their highest level in a year and helped trigger a three-day slide in the stock market. Trading was volatile, with major indexes fluctuating from little changed to higher through the course of the session as investors worried that the rising interest rates would hurt borrowing costs. A slight retracement in yields helped indexes bounce around midday, but trading remained skittish up until the close. "There's a fair amount of nervousness still prevalent in the equity market as a result of yields moving through 5 percent," said Michael James, senior trader at regional investment bank Wedbush Morgan in Los Angeles. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  rose 0.57 of a point to end at 13,424.96. From a percentage standpoint, the Dow was unchanged. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  was up 1.45 points, or 0.10 percent, at 1,509.12. But the Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  was down 1.39 points, or 0.05 percent, at 2,572.15. After the closing bell, shares of Texas Instruments Inc. TXN.N declined 2.2 percent to $35 after the chip maker lowered the mid-point of its second-quarter revenue target.

Apple's stock fell 3.5 percent to close at $120.19 on the Nasdaq, following a presentation by Apple CEO Steve Jobs on how developers can create programs for its iPhone. But there seemed to be some concern that the operating system wouldn't be completely open to program developers, according to published reports. RETAIL FEELS RATE CHILL Retailers' stocks also fell during regular trading, reflecting investors' anxiety about the impact of higher interest rates on consumer spending. Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ( WMT.N ) shed 0.5 percent to close at $49.81 on the New York Stock Exchange, while Home Depot ( HD.N ) declined 0.6 percent to $37.71. Both weighed on the blue-chip Dow average and S&P 500 index. On Monday, the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note's yield US10YT=RR rose to 5.16 percent from 5.11 percent late Friday, while its price slipped 11/32. Prices and yields move inversely. News that Japan's economy outperformed both the United States and the euro zone in the first three months of 2007 reinforced expectations for a hike in Japanese interest rates. Japanese rates -- barely above zero -- have until now lured investors to borrow money cheaply to invest elsewhere, including in U.S. equities, according to analysts. CHEVRON CLIMBS, NUCOR FALLS On the New York Mercantile Exchange, July crude CLN7 rose $1.21, or 1.87 percent, to settle at $65.97 per barrel. Shares of Chevron Corp. ( CVX.N ) advanced 0.8 percent to $81.36 on the NYSE. Exxon's stock rose 0.5 percent to $83.06. A disappointing outlook from steelmaker Nucor Inc. ( NUE.N ) raised doubts about profit growth and drove the company's stock down 5.9 percent to $62.66 on the NYSE. Nucor was among the heaviest weights on the S&P 500. The company said on Monday it expects second-quarter earnings to be well below Wall Street's expectations, hurt by softness in the automotive and residential construction sectors. Limiting the Nasdaq's decline was Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. TEVA.O, whose shares jumped 2.1 percent to $39.68 after a U.S. court refused to prohibit Teva from selling a generic version of Novartis AG's ( NOVN.VX ) Lotrel blood-pressure treatment. Teva said it would resume shipments of the drug immediately. For details, see <ID:nN11164505> The stock was the second-biggest advancer in the Nasdaq 100.NDX. Trading was moderate on the NYSE, with about 1.32 billion shares changing hands, below last year's estimated daily average of 1.84 billion. On the Nasdaq, about 1.69 billion shares traded, below last year's daily average of 2.02 billion. Advancing stocks were about even with declining ones on the NYSE, while decliners beat advances by about 16 to 14 on Nasdaq. (Additional reporting by  Ellis Mnyandu )
