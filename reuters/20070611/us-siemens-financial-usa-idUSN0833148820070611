 BOSTON  (Reuters) - The U.S. finance arm of Siemens AG ( SIEGn.DE ) aims to boost its lending volume by about 20 percent a year as it focuses on health care, energy and industrial businesses in a restructuring announced on Monday. 

 Siemens Financial Services Inc., which last year originated 1.2 billion euros ($1.6 billion) in new loans, is targeting 1.7 billion euros ($2.27 billion) by 2008, President and Chief Executive Roland Chalons-Browne said in an interview. "What I really wanted to change was the business development dynamic, if you will, from really a product sale to more of forming a problem-solving partnership with our customers," Chalons-Browne said. Siemens Financial was previously divided into seven groups. About half the loans the Iselin, New Jersey-based unit makes are used to buy Siemens-made equipment. Changes at the finance unit reflect a shift in the way Siemens' products, which have increased in capability and price, are purchased, Chalons-Browne said. For example, the typical price of a full-featured CT scan machine -- a medical imaging device similar to an X-ray machine -- has risen from about $1 million to about $3 million over the past few years. "As those pieces of equipment have become more and more expensive, increasingly those buying decisions are also made by a (chief financial officer) or a finance manager," alongside a product specialist, he explained. The German conglomerate, whose products range from lightbulbs to trains, in recent months has been embroiled in a scandal in which some of its officials have been accused of paying hundreds of millions of euros in bribes to secure contracts. An outsider, Peter Loescher, takes the over reins of the company on July 1, following the resignation of Siemens' chairman as well as its chief executive officer. Chalons-Browne said the changes at Siemens Financial have been underway since late last year and are unrelated to the change at the top. (1 euro = $1.3358)
