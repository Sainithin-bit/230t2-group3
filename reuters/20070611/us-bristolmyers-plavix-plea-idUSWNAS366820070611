 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. ( BMY.N ) on Monday said it had pleaded guilty to two federal criminal counts related to allegations it had illegally concealed a side deal to block introduction of a generic form of its blockbuster Plavix anti-clotting drug. 

 The drugmaker said it will pay a $1 million fine as a result of its guilty plea in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. Bristol-Myers on May 30 said it had agreed to pay the fine to resolve antitrust charges that it illegally concealed part of a patent settlement deal it had reached with Apotex Inc., a generic drugmaker based in Canada. To secure Apotex' willingness to hold back from launching its generic until 2011, Bristol-Myers offered the company an undisclosed amount of compensation. Federal investigators allege Bristol-Myers broke the law, however, by concealing it had privately assured Apotex in May 2006 it would not launch its own "authorized generic" form of Plavix in the event their overall plan won the required approval of numerous state attorneys general. Despite Bristol-Myers' guilty plea, company Chief Executive Officer Jim Cornelius on Monday issued a statement to employees asserting the drugmaker never had a "'side agreement' of any kind with Apotex not to launch an authorized version of Plavix." "Nevertheless, in entering our guilty plea today, we acknowledge responsibility for statements by one of our former senior executives expressing his personal views for the purpose of causing Apotex to conclude that Bristol-Myers would not launch an authorized generic," Cornelius said. Privately held Apotex on August 8 launched its cheaper copycat form of Bristol-Myers' biggest drug after the main arrangement between it and Bristol-Myers collapsed due to opposition from the state attorneys general. Only weeks later, on August 31, Judge Sidney Stein of the U.S. District Court in Manhattan granted a request from Bristol-Myers and its partner Sanofi-Aventis ( SASY.PA ) to block continued shipments of the Apotex generic. But Stein refused to recall huge supplies of the generic that Apotex had already delivered U.S. wholesalers. Although most supplies of the generic have now been sold, their availability in recent months has badly hurt sales of branded Plavix and the earnings of Bristol-Myers and Sanofi-Aventis.
