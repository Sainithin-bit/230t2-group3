 LONDON  (Reuters) - Car hire firm Avis Europe AVE.L said on Monday it was investigating possible financial irregularities at its Portuguese subsidiary. 

 Avis said net assets may have been overstated by around 3 million euros as of December 31 and that it had suspended some of its Portuguese management as a protective measure. Avis added that pretax profit for the current year could be impacted by approximately 3 million euros ($4.03 million) plus legal costs.
