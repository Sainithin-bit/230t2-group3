 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japanese Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda said on Monday he expects the central bank to continue supporting the economy with an ultra-easy monetary policy. 

 He also told a lower house budget committee meeting that the BOJ acted appropriately last week by easing monetary policy in light of recent economic developments, including the stronger yen. (Reporting by  Leika Kihara )
