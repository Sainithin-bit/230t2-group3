 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Standard & Poor's cut Freddie Mac ( FMCC.OB ) and Fannie Mae's ( FNMA.OB ) long-term ratings one notch on Monday. 

 S&P said the downgrades from the top-notch Triple-A were due to its lowering of the U.S. sovereign credit rating late on Friday. "The downgrades of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac reflect their direct reliance on the U.S. government," the rating agency said. (Reporting by  Edith Honan ; Editing by  James Dalgleish )
