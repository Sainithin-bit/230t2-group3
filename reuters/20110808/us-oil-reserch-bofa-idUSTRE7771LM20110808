 (Reuters) - Bank of America Merrill Lynch said on Monday crude oil prices will trend lower in the second half of the year as additional barrels from Saudi Arabia and non-OPEC countries provide some relief. 

 BofA sees Brent crude oil prices averaging $106 a barrel and WTI averaging $90 a barrel in the second half of 2011. It sees the 2012 average oil price at $114 a barrel for Brent and $102 a barrel for WTI. "We remain bullish in 2012 as global oil markets remain heavily undersupplied relative to the expected pace in economic growth," BofA said in a note to clients. In case of a mild recession, Brent crude oil prices might briefly break below $80 a barrel, the bank said. (Reporting by Soma Das in Bangalore)
