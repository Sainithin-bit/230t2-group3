 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Announcements should be expected this morning about more knock-on effects to corporations from S&P's decision to downgrade the United States' credit rating, the head of Standard & Poor's sovereign ratings said on Monday. 

 David Beers also told Reuters Insider television that the U.S. outlook could be raised to stable if the U.S. deficit-cutting deal is fully implemented and the Obama administration ends the Bush tax cuts. However, Beers said there was a one-in-three chance the U.S. rating could go lower again within six to 24 months. He added that S&P would be watching to see if the U.S. Congress follows through on the budget consolidation process it committed to while the course of interest rates and the so-far subpar economic recovery would also be factors. "What may affect whether the rating falls again is first of all the underlying economic story," Beers said. "This has been a fairly lackluster recovery, and so we're watching that very closely because of course it also will influence the future path of public finances."
