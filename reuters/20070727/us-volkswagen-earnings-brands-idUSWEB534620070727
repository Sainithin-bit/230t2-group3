 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Volkswagen ( VOWG.DE ) will meet its 2008 pretax profit target of 5.1 billion euros ($7 billion) a year earlier than planned as cost cuts boost results, the group said on Friday, sending its shares sharply higher. 

 After reporting second-quarter operating profit surged to 1.74 billion euros, far better than analysts expected, Volkswagen said it would "significantly" exceed in 2007 the previous year's figure before special items as it goes on to sell more than six million cars for the first time. "The increase in unit sales and the continuous optimization of cost structures will lead to a sustainable improvement in competitiveness and our earnings power," the world's fourth-largest car maker said in a statement. The company had previously only forecast that operating profit would "probably" surpass last year's pre-exceptional result of 4.38 billion euros. Finance chief Hans Dieter Poetsch told a conference call that Volkswagen would not rest on its laurels even if it achieves its pretax profit target one year early. "We might leave some more time to become more specific on any future targets, the only thing we can say from this point ... we clearly want to improve further in 2008," he said. A Reuters poll of 18 analysts had estimated quarterly operating profit of 1.47 billion and pretax of 1.46 billion -- also significantly short of VW's reported 1.94 billion before tax that includes contributions from its stakes in European truckmakers Scania ( SCVb.ST ) and MAN ( MANG.DE ). Volkswagen shares gained 3.55 percent to 124.82 euros, reversing earlier losses and clearly outperforming slight declines in the broader European market  .FTEU3 . Although its sales mix deteriorated as revenue growth lagged vehicle sales, VW's cost-cutting dramatically improved results, revealing a sharp improvement in its quarterly operating margin to 6.1 percent. "This was the area of greatest surprise: the margin was 120 basis points ahead of our expectation. Profitability across all units/brands was better than we had expected with the exception of Commercial Vehicles," Nomura analyst Michael Tyndall wrote in a research note. INDUSTRY-WIDE IMPROVEMENT While the VW brand continued to boost its performance on the back of last year's successful restructuring, Audi's earnings grew remarkably, and even the group's struggling Spanish unit SEAT managed to swing to a small quarterly profit. Asked about a long-speculated deal to merge its truck businesses with those of MAN and Scania to create a new European market leader, Poetsch kept his cards close to his chest. "I clearly said that we don't feel under pressure at all so from this point it's not possible to say whether we're going to see something this year or next year," he said. The company said it would consider producing cars in the United States if the dollar remains at current levels. "And when today's dollar exchange rate remains, basically we have to consider production locations in North America," Chief Financial Officer Hans Dieter Poetsch told a conference call. Results were given a lift from a 334 million euro quarterly gain in VW's "other" operating profit line, which often include factors like releases from provisions on warranties and is a figure difficult to predict. Once this is stripped out, VW's results fell even a bit short of consensus estimates. Automotive net cash flow also largely stagnated at 3.53 billion euros in the quarter. VW's increase in its full-year targets comes amid a spate of forecast-beating results from European rivals. Renault ( RENA.PA ) and PSA ( PEUP.PA ) of France both expanded first-half margins faster than expected while Fiat's ( FIA.MI ) car business more than doubled its quarterly trading profit. "Overall it's pleasing. It fits perfectly with the European auto story -- stable growth in earnings," a trader said, adding Audi particularly surprised on the upside. Nonetheless, VW's peers have taken a beating, with the DJ Stoxx European autos index .SXAP down almost 5 percent since Fiat posted results after markets closed on Tuesday as investors became more risk averse amid a credit market-related sell off. "At current levels, VW stock is discounting peak operating margin, and trading at 0.5x EV/Sales, very close to the peak reached in 1998 of 0.52x," Sanford Bernstein analyst Stephen Cheetham wrote. "In our view neither the current rate of sales growth nor 6 percent operating margin is likely to be sustainable and we believe investors looking at a profit should take it," he added.
