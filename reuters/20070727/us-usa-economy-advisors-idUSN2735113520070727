 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said on Friday the U.S. economy was making a transition to a more sustainable growth pace, and said recent market volatility should be a warning to investors. 

 Interviewed on CNBC television, Paulson said Thursday's global market slump was "a wake-up call" for investors who hadn't adequately assessed the risks they were taking. "We're seeing risk being repriced and a different perspective on risk," Paulson said, but he said the U.S. and global economies remained healthy. Paulson said parts of the U.S. economy, particularly the housing sector, had been booming at a pace that couldn't last and that was changing. "I think we're making that transition to a rate of growth that is sustainable and we have a healthy, diverse economy," he said. The U.S. economy grew at a strong 3.4 percent annual rate in the second quarter, according to government figures issued on Friday, though analysts anticipate the pace of growth will moderate in coming quarters. Paulson said the economy's performance in the second quarter, particularly in exports, was driven by strong growth outside the United States and not because of the weak dollar. "I'm very much for a strong dollar, that's very important," he said. "Now I believe what we're seeing is a strong global economy. This is the strongest global economy I've seen in 32 years. The growth rate in Europe has doubled. We've got growth throughout Asia. Japan is now growing, so I think this is being driven by strong growth outside of the U.S." Paulson heads for China again on Saturday and will meet top Chinese officials next Wednesday to urge Beijing to speed up economic reforms and let its yuan currency rise in appreciate more rapidly in value. U.S. lawmakers are working on a series of legislative initiatives to penalize China, possibly by imposing tariffs on Chinese-made imports, in protest against what U.S. producers claim is an unfairly cheap yuan currency that gives Chinese goods an unfair price advantage in the U.S. market and makes U.S. goods more expensive in China. "They have made it very clear that they're on a path to reform," Paulson said. "We're urging them to speed that up, and being very aggressive in terms of our direct dialogue." Paulson, who took over Treasury a year ago, will be making his fourth trip to China since then but it is amid a growing sense of U.S. congressional anger about a perception that China does not play fair on trade rules. Commerce Secretary Carlos Gutierrez, appearing on CNBC with Paulson, warned against negative sentiment toward China and economic globalization, which some analysts and lawmakers blame for U.S. job losses as producers shift production to cheap-labor countries where consumer protection laws are lax. "We don't believe that the solution is to manage imports through protectionism. That would be a tremendous mistake," Gutierrez said. "The solution is to export more and we're seeing that in this quarter, that's happening," he added. (additional reporting by Mary Childs)
