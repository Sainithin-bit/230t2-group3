 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Stephen Bollenbach, the retiring chief executive of Hilton Hotels Corp. HLT.N, stands to get about $125 million upon completion of the company's sale by private equity firm Blackstone Group ( BX.N ). 

 Details of the handsome payout came as Hilton revealed that it faced a dozen lawsuits by shareholders charging its board with breaching its fiduciary duties in agreeing to the $20 billion takeover by Blackstone. Hilton said in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday that it considered the payout packages of Bollenbach and other directors and executives in reaching its decision to approve the merger. The cash-out value of Bollenbach's vested and unvested stock options are $74.5 million, performance share units $13.3 million, and restricted stock units $2.2 million, according to the filing. In addition, the Hilton CEO and co-chairman, who plans to retire at the end of the year, also stands to receive $34.7 million under a deferred compensation plan, the filing says. Under the merger agreement, Bollenbach and others get to cash out when the merger closes rather than when the instruments vest. In the same filing, Hilton said 12 lawsuits had been filed against the company and its directors in various state and federal courts in California and Delaware. The lawsuits, which Hilton says contain similar allegations, claim that the terms of the merger agreement are unfair and that the consideration to be received by shareholders is inadequate. Hilton, the No. 2 U.S. hotel operator, said it planned to defend itself "vigorously" against the lawsuits. Earlier this month, Blackstone agreed to buy Hilton for $47.50 a share. The price represented a premium of about 26 percent over the stock's previous 25-year high of $37.82, reached on February 22. Hilton shares were up 64 cents, or 1.5 percent, at $44 in morning New York Stock Exchange trade. (Reporting by Chris Reiter)
