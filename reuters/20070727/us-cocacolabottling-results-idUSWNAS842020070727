 (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Bottling Co. Consolidated ( COKE.O ) reported about 32 percent rise in quarterly profit due to a combination of modest gross margin growth and cut in operating expenses. 

 The company posted second-quarter net income of $11.7 million, or $1.28 a share, compared with $8.9 million, or 97 cents a share a year ago. Net sales for the quarter rose to $390.4 million from $386.6 million. (Reporting by Dilipp S. Nag in Bangalore)
