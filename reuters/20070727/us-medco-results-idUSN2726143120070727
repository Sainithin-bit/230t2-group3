 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Medco Health Solutions Inc. MHS.N, a top U.S. pharmacy benefit manager, said on Friday that quarterly profit rose 26 percent, helped by a higher rate of dispensing generic drugs and an increase in home-delivery of prescriptions. 

 Medco, whose second-quarter results beat analyst estimates, also raised its full-year forecast and its shares rose 2.9 percent in early trading, extending a strong run in 2007. Net income rose to $214.9 million, or 76 cents per share, from $170.9 million, or 56 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding special items, earnings were 86 cents per share. Analysts on average expected 77 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. Susquehanna Financial Group analyst Constantine Davides called it a "pretty strong quarter." "I think people had baked in some upside, but this was probably a little bit above that," Davides said. Revenue rose 4.4 percent to $11 billion. Pharmacy benefit managers administer prescription drug benefits for employers and health plans and operate large mail-order pharmacies. Medco's adjusted volume of prescriptions handled rose 3.7 percent to 186.2 million. Mail-order prescriptions rose 6.3 percent to 23.5 million. A record 58.9 percent of prescriptions processed were for generics, compared with 53.9 percent in the year-earlier period. Medco said it was benefiting from the earlier-than-expected generic launch of Novartis' ( NOVN.VX ) blood-pressure drug Lotrel. More than half of Medco's profits are derived from delivering generic drugs by mail, according to the company. Medco can get low prices from generic manufacturers and capture more of the overall profit by dispensing the drugs itself, while its clients also seek greater use of lower-cost generics to cut their overall drug bills. The Franklin Lakes, New Jersey-based company lifted its full-year forecast to a range of $3.50 to $3.55 per share, excluding items, from its previous outlook of $3.40 to $3.45. Analysts expect $3.44. The company now projects a full-year earnings benefit from newly launched generics of 20 cents to 22 cents, up from 16 cents to 18 cents. Medco shares were $2.28 to $80.47 in early trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock is up about 51 percent this year, outpacing gains for shares of rival benefit manager Express Scripts Inc.
