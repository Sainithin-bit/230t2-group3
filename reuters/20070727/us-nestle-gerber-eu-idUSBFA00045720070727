 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - Nestle SA ( NESN.VX ), the world's largest food company, won permission on Friday from the European Commission to buy U.S. baby-food giant Gerber from Novartis AG ( NOVN.VX ) for $5.5 billion in cash. 

 "Although the transaction would enhance the portfolio of Nestle's products, the Commission did not identify any vertical and conglomerate competition concerns arising from the transaction," the Commission said in a statement. In Poland there was only limited overlap between the two companies plus competition from other players while in Cyprus, Iceland and Portugal, the Commission concluded that market entry is relatively easy and the markets are competitive. Nestle, already the world's biggest maker of infant formula, is now moving into the top position in baby food as well with the Gerber buy. Nestle has said it wants to expand Gerber operations globally. Nestle's has lacked a baby food brand in the United States and has been eager to buy Gerber for more than a decade. The maker of Nescafe coffee, KitKat chocolate bars and Perrier water, first tried to buy Gerber in the early 1990s, but lost out to Sandoz, which later became part of Novartis. Nestle recently bought Swiss-based Novartis's medical nutrition business for $2.5 billion as it moves its earnings focus away from mass items like bottled milk to high-margin products like made-to-order diet plans and hospital food. It said at the time the time of the Gerber deal, that the tie-up would give its nutrition division -- which includes infant formula, baby food, medical nutrition and weight management -- annual sales of about 10 billion Swiss francs. Gerber, which has been making strained peas and carrots since 1928, is expected to generate an estimated $1.95 billion in sales in 2007 and will improve Nestle's operating profit margin immediately, the Swiss-based company said.
