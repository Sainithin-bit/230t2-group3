 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Kraft Foods Inc KFT.N is expected to report an 8 percent drop in second-quarter earnings next week, but analysts will also be looking to see if three high-profile investors are having a profound influence on the company. 

 Activist investors Nelson Peltz and Carl Icahn both have purchased stakes in the No. 1 U.S. packaged food maker and the Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday that Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc ( BRKa.N ) also has bought a small stake. Kraft shares are down about 7.5 percent this year, compared with a 2.5 percent increase in the Standard & Poor's packaged foods index .15GSPFOOD. Analysts had been hoping the stock would get a boost earlier this year when Kraft Chairman and Chief Executive Irene Rosenfeld laid out her plans during a presentation in February. But it did not include the divestitures some analysts had been hoping for and the stock fell 3 percent the day it was announced. "It's too big, too unwieldy, too bureaucratic," said one rival food industry executive, speaking on the condition of anonymity. But with Peltz, Icahn and Buffett invested in the company -- and one or more of them possibly prodding management -- some analysts hope Kraft will be persuaded to sell some brands to hone its focus. "With Peltz and Icahn and Buffett all in there, that probably gives her some cover to make some other deals," Morningstar analyst Gregg Warren said. But instead of being a seller, Kraft instead announced a potential big acquisition earlier this month, when it said it was in talks with Danone ( DANO.PA ) to buy the French company's cookie business for $7.2 billion. The deal would help Kraft strengthen its foothold in Europe. SECOND-QUARTER VIEW Analysts largely expect Kraft, whose products range from Oreo cookies and Maxwell House coffee to Crystal Light drinks and South Beach Diet meals and snacks, to post earnings of 47 cents a share, before one-time items, on Wednesday, compared with 51 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. The company, which was spun off from Altria Group Inc. ( MO.N ) on March 30, has been facing rising prices for commodities such as milk and wheat, as well as falling market share in some products, analysts said. "U.S. retail takeaway trends remain sluggish with Kraft continuing to lose market share in several of its key categories, David Driscoll, analyst at Citigroup, wrote in a research note. Those include frozen pizza and nuts he said, citing AC Nielsen data for the 12 weeks ended June 16. Still, Driscoll, who rates the stock "hold," said the company has the "resources and brand equity to right the ship," over the long-term. Those high-powered, well-known brands may be a key factor that makes investors such as Peltz, Icahn and Buffett think there is value in Kraft, which trades at about 17.4 times estimated 2008 earnings, in the upper half of companies in the S&P packaged foods index. "We see value in the shares, particularly when you think about the huge opportunity the management has to improve margins," said Matt Arnold, Edward Jones analyst, who rates the stock a "buy." Kraft shares closed down 55 cents, or 1.6 percent, at $32.89 on Friday on the New York Stock Exchange. The shares have traded in a 52-week range of $37.19 and $29.95.
