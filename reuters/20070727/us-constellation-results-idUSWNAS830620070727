 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Power company Constellation Energy Group Inc. CEG.N said on Friday that second-quarter earnings rose 25 percent, driven by a strong performance from its merchant business. 

 Constellation, whose planned sale to peer FPL Group Inc. FPL.N collapsed under regulatory scrutiny last year, posted net income of $116.3 million, or 64 cents a share, compared with $93.1 million, or 52 cents per share, a year earlier. The results included a 14 cents per share loss on the changing value of its trading contracts, which the company expects will reverse in future periods with a significant portion reversing this year. Excluding these hedge losses, the company earned 78 cents per share compared with average analysts' expectations of 74 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Quarterly sales rose 10 percent to $4.82 billion, the Baltimore-based company said. The company's regulated Baltimore Gas and Electric unit posted lower earnings excluding special items, falling 3 cents to 8 cents per share. The loss of nuclear decommissioning revenues and rising costs outstripped higher electricity sales from customer growth and warmer weather. Earnings from its unregulated merchant segment surged 75 percent to 56 cents per share on strong performance from its generation fleet along with lower interest expense. Constellation expects third-quarter earnings of $1.35 to $1.55 a share. Wall Street has forecast average earnings of $1.58 a share, according to Reuters Estimates. The company also stood by its 2007 outlook of $4.30 to $4.65 a share and 2008 earnings of $5.25 to $5.75 a share. Analysts, on average, have forecast earnings of $4.58 a share for 2007 and $5.61 a share for 2008. Constellation Energy also said it expects earnings in 2009 to grow more than 10 percent over 2008.
