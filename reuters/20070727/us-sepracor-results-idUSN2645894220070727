 BOSTON  (Reuters) - Sepracor Inc. SEPR.O posted lower-than-expected second-quarter earnings on Friday and cut its outlook as competitive and reimbursement pressures hurt sales of its asthma and insomnia drugs, sending its shares down nearly 27 percent. 

 Net profit fell to $6.1 million, or 5 cents a share, from $11 million, or 10 cents a share, a year ago. Analysts had on average expected earnings of 36 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue rose a less-than-expected 5 percent to $278.1 million, with sales of insomnia drug Lunesta growing just 3 percent to $143.0 million as it struggled to fight off competition from a generic version of rival Ambien. "The numbers are a disaster," said Ian Sanderson, an analyst at Cowen & Co. Sales of respiratory drug Xopenex inhaled solution fell to $104.9 million from $115.7 million a year ago, also short of expectations, as wholesalers reduced their inventory ahead of an expected drop in demand following a reduction in reimbursement. As of July 1, Medicare, the U.S. government health plan for the elderly, cut reimbursement levels for Xopenex after the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services applied the same reimbursement code to Xopenex and to generic albuterol, the active ingredient in Xopenex. "The results are worse than anyone expected," said Jon LeCroy, an analyst at Natixis Bleichroeder Inc. "The question now is can they get sales moving again and can they cut costs?" Sepracor's shares have fallen 54 percent since the beginning of the year compared to a gain of 0.2 percent in the Nasdaq Biotech Index .NBI, and there is nothing on the horizon that is likely to change that in the near term, analysts said. "The outlook for Lunesta is difficult, the outlook for Xopenex is difficult, and they don't have much in their pipeline," Sanderson said. "The new chief executive has been charged with trying to acquire products but it's a very competitive environment to do that." Earlier this year Sepracor named Adrian Adams to the post of chief executive. He was formerly the chief operating officer. Sepracor's shares have been propped up to some extent in recent months by speculation it could be taken over, as insomnia drugs are in hot demand and the market is growing. Now investors are weighing whether an acquisition is more likely now that the stock has fallen, or whether there is room for it to drop further, as the full impact of the Xopenex reimbursement cut becomes clear. "If we haven't seen the worst yet, the stock could go lower, but you have to offset that against what these assets might be worth to a big acquirer," said LeCroy. Sepracor, which is based in Marlborough, Massachusetts, brought down its 2007 revenue forecast to between $1.23 billion and $1.3 billion from a previous forecast of between $1.43 billion to $1.49 billion. It cut its Lunesta sales estimate to between $595 million and $615 million from a previous estimate of roughly $630 million, and it forecast Xopenex sales of between $495 million to $515 million. The company said it now expects 2007 earnings of $1.00 to $1.30 a share including a 28-cent-per-share charge for settlement of litigation. In April, the company said it expected 2007 earnings of $2.11 a share, excluding one-time items. Separately, the company said Japanese drug maker Eisai Co. Ltd. ( 4523.T ) has bought the rights to market Lunesta in Japan and that has submitted an application to market Lunesta in Europe, where it is known as Lunivia. The company's shares were down 26 percent at $28.29 in afternoon trading on Nasdaq. (Additional reporting by  Debra Sherman  and  Jim Finkle )
