 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Wall Street is taking a "wait and see" approach to news that Gap Inc. ( GPS.N ), the struggling yet iconic American apparel retailer, has chosen a little-known Canadian drugstore executive as its next leader. 

 Concerns that incoming chief executive Glenn Murphy lacks apparel experience were high in the minds of apparel analysts on Friday. Still, shares of Gap rose nearly 5 percent in afternoon trade, helped by Citigroup raising the company's stock rating to "buy" from "hold." On Thursday, Gap said it had appointed Murphy, a 45-year-old Canadian who most recently served as CEO of Toronto-based Shoppers Drug Mart ( SC.TO ) to lead the operator of the Gap, Old Navy and Banana Republic clothing chains. Analysts were quick to point out that, although Murphy had an impressive track record in his industry (earnings doubled during his six years at Shoppers Drug Mart), the pharmacy sector is a far cry from the fickle world of fashion. "We believe the world of fashion retailing that is Gap's core is a far different area than either food or health and beauty aids," wrote A.G. Edwards analyst Robert Buchanan. As Goldman Sachs' Margaret Mager noted: "With the two largest divisions (of Gap) under pressure, Mr. Murphy is facing an uphill battle compounded by his lack of apparel experience." Still, Citigroup analyst Kimberly Greenberger, who raised her rating on the company to "buy", said in a brief note that Murphy's experience provides a solid base from which to tackle Gap's challenges. "The new CEO can positively impact customer focus and in-store experience with brand presidents Marka Hansen and Dawn Robertson focusing on improving product by 1H08," Greenberger wrote. MURPHY THE UNKNOWN Another problem in gauging Murphy's potential impact on Gap is the lack of familiarity by apparel analysts with the drugstore sector. In addition, Murphy's career has largely been built in Canada with public companies that trade on the Toronto Stock Exchange. Gap is headquartered in San Francisco. But analysts did cite Murphy's success at turnarounds and his track record in driving revenue and earnings growth. Also noted were store initiatives at Shoppers Drugs Mart that helped boost productivity and resonated with shoppers, including improving the look of stores. And several analysts noted that that Murphy's lack of apparel experience could be offset by guidance from experienced direct reports -- namely, Gap's apparel veterans such as Marka Hansen who leads the Gap chain, and Dawn Robertson at Old Navy. Gap has suffered from sliding or flat same-store sales -- a key measure of financial retail health -- in every month but three since mid-2004. Hurting the legendary American retailer has been intense competition from a slew of rivals ranging from specialty stores like American Eagle Outfitters ( AEO.N ) to big-box names like Target Corp. ( TGT.N ) or Kohl's ( KSS.N ), which sell fashion on the cheap. Gap executives have also acknowledged that the company has been confused about its target customer -- too much emphasis on teen shoppers in prior quarters had alienated the company's core demographic of shoppers in their 20s and early 30s. Shares of Gap traded at $17.75, up 85 cents, on the New York Stock Exchange.
