 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - KeyCorp ( KEY.N ), a large regional U.S. bank, on Friday said it agreed to buy U.S.B. Holding Co. UBH.N, the parent of Union State Bank, for $575 million in cash and stock to expand in southern New York state. 

 The terms value U.S.B. at about $24.95 per share, a 63 percent premium based on the companies' respective Thursday closing prices. KeyCorp said U.S.B. shareholders will receive 0.455 of a KeyCorp share and $8.925 in cash for each of their shares. U.S.B., based in Orangeburg, New York, operates 31 branches in Orange, Rockland and Westchester counties, as well as in Manhattan and in Stamford, Connecticut. Founded in 1969, it has about $2.9 billion of assets, $2 billion of deposits and $1.6 billion of loans. Beth Mooney, head of community banking at Cleveland-based KeyCorp, said the purchase "will significantly enhance our presence in attractive markets." KeyCorp operates about 954 branches, including many in New York state. The transaction is expected to close within six months, and add to KeyCorp earnings in 2009. KeyCorp expects to incur a $26 million charge. The law firm Sullivan & Cromwell advised KeyCorp on the transaction.
