 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Gemstar-TV Guide International Inc GMST.O said on Friday its quarterly profit rose 42 percent, helped by technology patent licensing and improved ad revenue at its TV Guide magazine. 

 The company, which produces television programming guides across different media formats, is in the midst of exploring a possible sale or other options. Second-quarter net income was $20.8 million or 5 cents per share, compared with $14.6 million or 3 cents per share a year before. Revenue rose 17 percent to $155.6 million. Analysts, on average, had expected earnings of 4 cents per share and revenue of $149.4 million, according to Reuters Estimates. Gemstar's guidance technology segment posted a jump in quarterly revenue to $70.7 million from $50.6 million a year ago, helped by patent licensing internationally and an increase in subscribers for its U.S. cable and satellite clients. TV Guide magazine revenue rose 2 percent to $35 million, fueled by a 16 percent rise in advertising sales. But the unit posted a loss on an adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) basis. Gemstar expects it to post an EBITDA loss of $24 million to $28 million for all of 2007, with a declining series of losses in the following three years. The company said it expects higher costs for some of its operations in the second half of the year as it invests in producing television programs and increases expenses for promoting TV Guide. Gemstar shares rose to $6.06 before the market's open after closing at $5.88 on the Nasdaq on Thursday. (Reporting by  Michele Gershberg )
