 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Outdoor advertising company Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings Inc. ( CCO.N ) said on Friday its quarterly profit rose 43 percent, helped by growth in ads by automotive, telecommunications and retail companies. 

 The San Antonio, Texas, company posted second-quarter net profit of $68.6 million, or 19 cents per share, up from $48.0 million, or 14 cents per share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 12 percent to $836.7 million, including $29 million in foreign exchange gains. Revenue growth excluding those gains would have been 8 percent. Analysts, on average, were looking for earnings per share of 20 cents on revenue of $822 million for the second quarter, according to Reuters Estimates. International revenue, which accounted for 55 percent of total revenue, rose 11 percent from a year earlier, with Italy, Spain and Ireland contributing to the rise, Clear Channel Outdoor said. Americas revenue, accounting for the remaining 45 percent, rose 12 percent from a year ago. The company is a unit of radio station operator Clear Channel Communications Inc. ( CCU.N ), which agreed in May to a $19.6 billion buyout by Bain Capital Partners and Thomas H. Lee Partners. The deal has yet to be approved by shareholders.
