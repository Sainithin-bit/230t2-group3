 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A spike in U.S. Treasury yields triggered an selloff in equity markets on Wednesday, as investors feared rising funding costs might delay a potential recovery in the world's largest economy. 

 World stocks initially rose as signs of economic recovery were reported from Japan to the United States, encouraging investors to move out of lower-yielding assets such as U.S. Treasuries. But Wall Street later soured as the Treasury sell-off accelerated despite a well-received auction of new five-year notes. Compounding investor fears was a warning by Moody's that U.S. credit ratings could come under pressure if the government fails to reduce debt levels once economic growth returns, though Moody's affirmed the U.S.'s AAA rating for now. The three main U.S. stock indexes turned negative early afternoon as Treasuries maturing from 10 and 30 years lost over a full point in price, sending yields to six- and nine-month highs, respectively. "The two-year auction was great, the five-year was OK, but we won't know if things are OK or not until we get the 10-year, as the further you go out in duration, the more critical it is that the U.S. can get funding," said Steven Butler, head of currency trading at Scotia Capital in Toronto. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note lost 44/32, with the yield at 3.7147 percent. The 2-year U.S. Treasury note declined 1/32, with the yield at 0.9661 percent. The 30-year U.S. Treasury bond slipped 66/32, with the yield at 4.6258 percent. Spreads between 10- and two-year note yields gapped to 275 basis points, resulting in the steepest U.S. Treasury yield curve on record as rising U.S. deficits drove investors to request higher compensation for holding longer-dated instruments. Wall Street led losses on global equity markets. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  closed 2.05 percent lower, while the Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  lost 1.90 percent, and the Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  finished 1.11 percent lower. The MSCI world equity index .MIWD00000PUS fell 0.55 percent while the MSCI index for emerging-market stocks .MSCIEF trimmed early gains to rise 1.7 percent, both partially supported by early gains in Asian and European markets. European equities finished higher for a third straight session after France, Europe's second-largest economy, posted a small rise in consumer confidence for May. In Sweden, consumer confidence also beat estimates. The FTSEurofirst 300  .FTEU3  of top European shares ended 0.6 percent higher, booking gains in eight of the past 10 sessions. DOLLAR MIXED The U.S. dollar weakened against the British pound, propelled by hopes of improvement in the UK economy and banking sector, but firmed against the euro after a European Central Bank official said interest rates could fall further if economic conditions worsen. Sterling traded above $1.60 for the first time in almost seven months. The euro weakened 0.71 percent at $1.389. Against the Japanese yen, the dollar was up 0.17 percent at 95.16. The euro has climbed more than 5.0 percent against the dollar so far in May, lifted partly as cautious optimism about the world economy dulled the U.S. dollar's safe-haven appeal. But that view was shaken a bit as U.S. housing data on Wednesday showed the inventory of unsold homes rose last month, stoking worries that prices have further to fall. The data also showed, however, that U.S. existing home sales climbed in April to an annual rate of 4.68 million from a 4.55 million pace in March, slightly higher than market expectations for a 4.66 million-unit pace. In commodity markets, U.S. crude oil futures settled at the highest level in almost seven months on expectations that OPEC would not alter production levels when it meets on Thursday. U.S. oil futures for July settled up $1, or 1.6 percent, at $63.45 a barrel, the highest close since $65.30 on November 5. (Additional reporting by  Pedro Nicolaci da Costa ,  Steven C.
