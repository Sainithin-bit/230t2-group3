 (Reuters) - Bidders for General Motors' German unit Opel were being urged on Wednesday to improve their offers ahead of an evening meeting with the German government that was set to narrow the field of potential investors. 

 Below are some key elements of the bidders' plans: FIAT SPA Fresh from signing an agreement with Chrysler, Fiat CEO Sergio Marchionne revealed plans to create a European auto giant with the scale needed to survive the crisis. Under the "Phoenix" plan, Fiat -- Europe's sixth-largest carmaker by sales in 2008 -- wants to combine GM Europe's Opel, Vauxhall and Saab brands, GM Mercosul (Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay) and GM South Africa with Fiat group brands Fiat, Alfa Romeo, Lancia and LCV. Combined proforma revenue could grow to 58 billion euros in 2010, with recurring savings of 1.4 billion euros after 2015. Fiat says the combined entity would need funding of about 7 billion euros over two years, assuming no cash or financial debt contributions from Fiat or GM. The plan would mean finding "another production mission within Fiat Group" for its Termini Imerese plant, and "another mission" for the UK's Luton plant. MAGNA Magna has teamed up with Russian bank Sberbank Rossii, with carmaker GAZ as industrial partner in a plan involving investment of up to 700 million euros in Opel, with credit lines guaranteed by the German government. Magna wants Opel and GM to gain 20 percent of the Russian market in the short term, and eventually sell 1 million units there. Magna wants to leave existing GM Europe managers to run the group and pledged to keep all four Opel plants in Germany. Under Magna's plan, GM would keep a 35 percent equity stake in Opel, Sberbank would get 35 percent, Magna would take 20 percent, and Opel's employees 10 percent. RHJ RHJ has not revealed details of its bid for Opel. The Belgium-listed company has historically invested heavily in Japan and also focused on the automotive parts sector. It has expressed an interest in diversifying geographically, particularly into Europe, and in pushing deeper into financial services. It holds a 60.18 percent stake in Japanese cast autoparts maker Asahi Tec Corp. BAIC Chinese carmaker BAIC's plan envisions keeping all four Opel plants in Germany for at least two years and foresees no job cuts in the country, a financial source said, adding the concept called for less than 5 billion euros in state aid. BAIC would invest 660 million euros in equity. Another source familiar with the matter said BAIC planned to make Opel a global brand, selling in Asia, Latin America and elsewhere, where GM would be "not exactly pleased" with the competition.
