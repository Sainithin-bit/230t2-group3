 BERLIN  (Reuters) - The German government has decided to give Fiat ( FIA.MI ) and Magna MGa.TO preferred bidder status for Opel and grant them access to the carmaker's books, according to a report in German daily Die Welt. 

 The newspaper, citing sources close to talks taking place in the German Chancellery on Wednesday, said the two other bidders RHJ International ( RHJI.BR ) and China's BAIC, would be allowed to further develop their offers. No one was immediately available in the German government to comment on the report. (Writing by  Noah Barkin )
