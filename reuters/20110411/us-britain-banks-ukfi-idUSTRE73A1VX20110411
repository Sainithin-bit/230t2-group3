 LONDON  (Reuters) - The commission charged with drawing up potential reforms of Britain's banking sector said on Monday that it hoped the government body managing taxpayers' stakes in banks was ready to cooperate. 

 "It's probably fair to say that we would be grateful if UKFI would cooperate. We hope they see the world the same way that we do," commission member Martin Taylor told reporters. Taylor was responding to a question about whether the UKFI, which manages stakes in Lloyds and RBS, would be making a mistake if it failed to take into account the commission's view that disposals at Lloyds should go further than currently envisaged.
