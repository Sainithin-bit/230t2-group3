 LONDON  (Reuters) - Part-nationalized British bank Lloyds might have to sell much more of its business than already required by regulators to boost competition in the British banking sector, a UK banking commission said. 

 However, the Independent Commission on Banking (ICB) added in its interim report that it would be unwise to unwind Lloyds' 2008 emergency takeover of rival HBOS. Britain rushed through approval of Lloyds' takeover of HBOS in 2008 at the height of the financial crisis in a move it said would help to stave off the collapse of the country's banking system. The government owns roughly 41 percent of Lloyds and 83 percent of rival Royal Bank of Scotland after bailing out both banks with billions of pounds of taxpayers' money during the credit crisis. "There is cause for regret that the government in 2008 amended competition law to facilitate the Lloyds TSB/HBOS merger but the facts in 2011 have to be taken as they are. In the light of those facts, reversing the merger does not appear to be a sensible course to pursue," the commission said. Lloyds said in a statement that it was assessing the implications of the ICB's proposals. Following the bailout, RBS and Lloyds were ordered by regulators to sell off some assets and trim their balance sheets and last month, Lloyds appointed U.S. banks JPMorgan Chase & Co and Citigroup to oversee the sale of 600 branches. The commission said there was a strong case for the government to "enhance" Lloyds' program of asset sales. "The commission.....suggests that the government seek agreement with Lloyds Banking Group to enhance the divestiture substantially," it said. It warned that if the asset sale program was not extended, a probe by competition authorities into current account and small and medium business lending could be warranted. The ICB said there was less of a case to make RBS sell off more assets than it has already been told to. "The case for enhancing the RBS divestiture does not appear to be as strong as for the Lloyds Banking Group divestiture," it said. The credit crisis also led to Britain having to fully nationalize Northern Rock, which the government is likely to sell back to the private sector at some point, and the ICB said this could be used to form a new "challenger" bank. "In particular, the Commission would not want to preclude the possibility of Northern Rock plc being used to strengthen competition at a national level, for example by being combined with the Lloyds Banking Group divestiture in order to strengthen a new challenger bank." Lloyds was told by European authorities in November 2009 it had four years to sell at least 600 branches, 4.6 percent of the personal current (or checking) account market and 19 percent of its mortgage book to limit competition distortions after taking the taxpayer bailout. Those businesses for sale would on their own, create Britain's seventh biggest bank or building society in terms of current accounts and branches and could be worth over 3 billion pounds ($4.92 billion), analysts have said. NBNK Investments, a new banking start-up, has said it wants to buy the Lloyds branches. [ID:nLDE68C1FF] Other suitors could include Virgin Money, National Australia Bank or Spain's BBVA.
