 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Developed nations are seeing very little pass-through to core inflation from rising food and energy prices, the International Monetary Fund said on Monday. 

 "When we look at inflation in advanced or emerging market countries, what we see is clearly a direct effect of commodity prices on headline inflation, but the important question for monetary policy is how does it translate into core inflation," said IMF chief economist Olivier Blanchard. "We see a fairly major difference in the two groups of countries. In emerging markets we have seen an increase in core inflation; in advanced countries, we do not see much pass-though to core inflation." (Editing by  James Dalgleish )
