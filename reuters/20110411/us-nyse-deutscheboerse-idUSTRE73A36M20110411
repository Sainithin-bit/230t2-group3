 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Deutsche Boerse ( DB1Gn.DE ) has no plans to raise its offer for NYSE Euronext NYX.N, two people familiar with the company's thinking said on Monday. 

 The operator of the Frankfurt stock exchange is preparing to file an offer document with German regulator BaFin as early as Tuesday, the people said. Deutsche Boerse declined to comment. On Sunday, NYSE Euronext's board of directors unanimously rejected the rival $11.3 billion offer from Nasdaq OMX Group ( NDAQ.O ) and IntercontinentalExchange ( ICE.N ), saying it was too risky and counter to the Big Board's vision. At current share price levels Deutsche Boerse's offer is worth $10 billion, less than the Nasdaq/ICE offer. (Reporting by  Edward Taylor ; Writing by  Maria Sheahan )
