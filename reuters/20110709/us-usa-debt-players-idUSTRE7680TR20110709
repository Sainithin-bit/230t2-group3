 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The White House says a series of talks on debt and deficits this weekend are vital to getting a deal that clears the way for Congress to raise the $14.3 trillion debt ceiling by August 2. 

 In the run-up to a meeting President Barack Obama will host at the White House on Sunday evening, Vice President Joe Biden and key White House staff members will be working closely with Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill to try to hammer out the outlines of a possible agreement. Here are the key players in those discussions: JOE BIDEN - Biden, a 36-year veteran of the Senate, has taken on an increasing role as an emissary for the Obama administration on Capitol Hill. He is trusted by Democratic lawmakers but has also developed a rapport with some key Republicans, including Senate Minority leader Mitch McConnell. During May and June, Biden led a series of talks with lawmakers that the administration hopes will lay the groundwork for an eventual deal on the deficits and the debt limit. GENE SPERLING - Sperling, Obama's top economic adviser, is a veteran of the budget battles of the 1990s when he served in under President Bill Clinton. Picked in January to succeed Larry Summers on the White House National Economic Council, Sperling's clout within the administration grew when he emerged as a key player in talks with Republicans last December on a tax-cut package. At the time, he was a senior Treasury Department official. JACK LEW - As White House budget director, Lew has kept a relatively low public profile but is a highly influential adviser behind the scenes who has a reputation as a budget hawk. Picked by Obama a year ago to replace former budget director Peter Orszag, Lew held the same position during Clinton's second term. He is a former hedge fund manager. BARRY JACKSON - Jackson, chief of staff to U.S. House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner, is taking the lead role for Republicans. Jackson, who served as an aide in President George W. Bush's White House, was the Republicans' main negotiator in talks that narrowly averted a government shutdown earlier this year. He has been an important player in Republican politics for decades and helped draft the "Contract with America," a set of conservative goals pushed by former House Speaker Newt Gingrich during the 1990s. DAVID KRONE - Krone serves as chief of staff to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, a Democrat. Krone was the Democrats' lead negotiator in the budget battle earlier this year. He was a lobbyist before he began working for Reid. ROHIT KUMAR - A deputy chief of staff to Senate Republican leader McConnell, Kumar is expected to play a secondary role as Barry Jackson takes the lead. BRUCE REED - Reed is Biden's chief of staff. Known as a centrist Democrat, Reed was executive director for the Bowles-Simpson panel, which issued a report last year recommending ways to cut the U.S. budget deficit. BILL DALEY - Daley, the White House chief of staff, is a former commerce secretary whose experience in the private sector as a banker was welcomed by the business community when he joined the Obama administration earlier this year. ROB NABORS - Nabors worked as a deputy director in the White House budget office in the early part of the Obama administration. He now heads the White House legislative affairs office.
