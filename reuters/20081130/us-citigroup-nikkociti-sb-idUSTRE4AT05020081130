 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Struggling Citigroup Inc ( C.N ) plans to sell NikkoCiti Trust and Banking Corp, its trust bank unit in Japan, as part of its global restructuring efforts, Japanese media reports said on Sunday. 

 The assets could be worth anywhere from 10 billion yen to 40 billion yen ($105 million to $420 million), various media reports estimated. An auction could be held as early as Monday, the Nikkei business daily said, without citing any sources. Major Japanese trust banks such as Mitsubishi UFJ Trust and Banking Corp, a subsidiary of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group ( 8306.T ), Sumitomo Trust & Banking Co Ltd 8403.T, and Mizuho Trust & Banking Co Ltd 8404.T, are likely to make bids for the Citigroup unit, Nikkei said. Kyodo news agency and several other Japanese dailies carried similar reports. Yomiuri Shimbun said the sale could be worth 10 billion yen to 20 billion yen, while Nikkei said it may go for around 40 billion yen. NikkoCiti Trust had 136 employees and 20 billion yen in capital as of September 30, according to its website. Officials at NikkoCiti Trust were not immediately available for comment. Earlier this month, the U.S. government unveiled a massive rescue plan for Citigroup, agreeing to shoulder most potential losses on about $306 billion of the bank's risky assets, and to inject new capital.
