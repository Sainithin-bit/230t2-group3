 MEXICO CITY  (Reuters) - Mexican tycoon Carlos Slim is not in talks to buy Citigroup's Mexican bank Banamex despite speculation in the local market, a spokesman for Slim said on Friday. 

 Telecoms magnate Slim is "not even in talks," about acquiring Banamex, Mexico's No. 2 bank, spokesman Arturo Elias Ayub said. "The rumor is absolutely false," he said. Citigroup, intrically involved in the global credit debacle, has lost more than $28.5 billion in the last 15 months. The losses have given rise to speculation that it would sell Banamex to raise cash. Analysts and traders in Mexico say Slim, one of the world's richest men, would be the most obvious buyer. "There is local talk that the sale of Banamex has been sealed with a local consortium of investors. An announcement could be made over the weekend," Royal Bank of Scotland said in a note to clients on Friday. It did not mention Slim. Citigroup said it would divide itself into one business focused on commercial and retail banking, and another on brokerage, retail asset management, consumer finance and troubled assets. A Banamex spokesman in Mexico City told Reuters he did not know of any plan to sell the bank. Banamex had 286 billion pesos ($21 billion) in loans and 343 billion pesos in deposits in November and is second in Mexico to Spain's BBVA. Mexico's banks, dominated by international players including Santander and HSBC, have weathered the world financial crisis relatively well because they have not dabbled in risky businesses like subprime lending.
