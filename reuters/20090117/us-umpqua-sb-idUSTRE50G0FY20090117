 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Regulators closed Vancouver, Washington-based Bank of Clark County on Friday, with Umpqua Bank assuming customers' insured deposits. 

 Bank of Clark County had $446.5 million in assets and $366.5 million in deposits, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp said in a statement. Umpqua Bank, a subsidiary of Umpqua Holdings Corp ( UMPQ.O ), agreed to assume insured deposits of the Bank of Clark County, which will reopen on Tuesday as branches of Umpqua Bank. The FDIC insures up to $250,000 per account through 2009 and individual retirement accounts at insured banks. But Bank of Clark County had about $39.3 million in uninsured deposits in 138 accounts that may exceed the insured limit, the FDIC said. It added that "is likely to change once the FDIC obtains additional information from these customers." Customers with insured deposits can access their money over the weekend by check, teller machine or debit card, the agency said. The bank's failure is expected to cost the FDIC's Deposit Insurance Fund between $120 and $145 million, it said. (Reporting by  Susan Heavey ; Editing by  Gary Hill )
