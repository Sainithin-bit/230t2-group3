 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The incoming Obama administration is considering ways of using government capital to acquire bad assets and unclog the financial system, people familiar with the Obama team's thinking said on Saturday. 

 The U.S. Federal Reserve, Treasury and Federal Deposit Insurance Corp, a bank regulator, have been in talks about ways to ease a banking crisis that is again deepening -- and a government-run "aggregator bank" is among the options. Outgoing Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and FDIC Chairman Sheila Bair said on Friday a government bank to round up bad assets was one of a number of ideas U.S. regulators had been discussing to restore confidence in U.S. banks. Shares in Bank of America and Citigroup plunged this week as investors worried about the health of their finances. The sources said advisers to President-elect Barack Obama, who takes office on Tuesday under the shadow of the worst U.S. financial crisis in decades, were also considering the idea of an aggregator bank among other options. David Axelrod, a top adviser to Obama, told Reuters the new administration would have something to say about a fresh approach to the financial crisis in "the next few days." "There are a range of things we're going to have to do to stabilize the financial community and part of it is going to involve housing, and part of it is going to involve how we approach this issue generally," Axelrod said. In addition to steps to bolster banks, Obama officials want to attack aggressively the underlying causes of the credit crisis: the sharp downturn in the U.S. housing market and the related deterioration in mortgage-related assets. One of the sources said options being considered by Obama's team included the creation of a single national "bad bank," individual institutions to specialize in different asset classes, "bad banks" within existing large private banks, or some combination of the three. BACK TO THE FUTURE Bair and Paulson said the government could use money from a roughly half-used $700 billion U.S. financial rescue fund to capitalize an institution to absorb "toxic" assets of banks. By taking on bad assets, officials hope to make banks attractive again to badly needed private capital and allow them to renew lending, boosting the economy. That was the original aim of the bailout fund known as the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP, which was revamped to focus instead on providing capital to struggling banks. The idea of relieving banks of their bad assets, alongside injecting more public money into them, won support from one of the world's top fund managers on Saturday. "In time, this would help reliquify an economy that has been brought to its knees by the credit crunch," Mohamed El-Erian, chief executive of Pacific Investment Management Company, told Reuters. "While far from inexpensive, it would be far cheaper than the alternatives, including offsetting the short- and longer-term effects on the economy of a further implosion of the banking system," he said. A surge in U.S. mortgage defaults led to a global credit crisis that has raged since the summer of 2007. Goldman Sachs has estimated that losses worldwide could mount to $2 trillion, about double what has been realized so far. British Prime Minister Gordon Brown told the Financial Times on Saturday that banks needed to reveal the true size of their losses as a step toward moving past the crisis. While officials have been discussing leveraging money from the U.S. bailout fund, it is not clear whether the fund is large enough for the task at hand. Seeking more money, on top of a planned $825 billion economic stimulus push, may rattle investors further about the state of U.S. public finances. "They may very well have to come back to ask for TARP Two," said Moody's Economy.com chief economist Mark Zandi. ACTIONS NEEDED Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke said on Tuesday it was critical to bolster the banking system to complement huge tax cuts and public spending to lift the recession-mired economy. He said the government could buy bad assets from banks or offer them guarantees against losses on assets that would be ring-fenced but remain on bank balance sheets, a tactic used to help Citigroup and Bank of America. A third option would be to set up bad banks with public cash, similar to the U.S. Resolution Trust Corp, which liquidated almost $400 billion in assets from more than 700 insolvent savings and loans institutions from 1989 to 1995.
