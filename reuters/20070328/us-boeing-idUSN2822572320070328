 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Boeing Co. ( BA.N ) plans to debut its much-anticipated 787 Dreamliner model on July 8 at an event at its assembly plant in Everett, Washington, the plane maker said on Wednesday. 

 The mid-sized 787 aircraft, which uses lightweight carbon composite material to reduce operating costs, has racked up roughly $70 billion in orders in about three years on the market. At the event -- to be held on 7/8/07, according to American dating conventions -- the public will be able to see the aircraft fully assembled for the first time. The first test flight of the 787 is planned for late August. The first delivery of the plane, which is sold out until 2013, is scheduled for May 2008. Fueled by demand for the 787, Boeing topped EADS-unit ( EAD.PA ) Airbus in new plane orders in 2006 -- the first time Boeing bested its rival since 2000. Airbus has struggled with the design of the A350, its rival product to the 787. The Airbus jet is expected to enter service in 2013.
