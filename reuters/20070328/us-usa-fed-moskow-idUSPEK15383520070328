 BEIJING  (Reuters) - Any change in U.S. interest rates will depend on how fresh figures influence the Federal Reserve's economic forecast, Chicago Federal Reserve President Michael Moskow reaffirmed on Wednesday. 

 But in a speech in Shanghai, Moskow made no mention of data issued on Tuesday that showed U.S. consumer confidence weakened in March and that U.S. single-family home prices posted their first annual decline in January in more than a decade. Moskow's prepared speech, posted by the Chicago Fed on its Web site, was identical to one he gave in Beijing on Tuesday. "My assessment is that the risk of inflation remaining too high is greater than the risk of growth falling too low," Moskow, a current voting member of the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee, said.
