 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Orders for U.S.-made big-ticket items were weaker than expected in February as a stricken housing industry put a drag on the economy, a report on Wednesday showed. 

 New orders for U.S.-made durable goods rose 2.5 percent. Excluding volatile transportation orders, demand for goods meant to last more than three years was down for the fourth time in the last five months. The Commerce Department reported that excluding transportation orders, which are heavily skewed by aircraft, durable goods orders fell 0.1 percent. U.S. Treasury debt prices rallied on the surprisingly weak report, while stocks fell after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke in testimony before Congress expressed concerns about the economic outlook. The dollar was down against the yen. Bernanke, testifying to the Joint Economic Committee, highlighted the risks the slumping housing market poses to the economy and noted business investment was weaker than expected. "Although some of this pullback can be explained by the recent moderation in the growth of output, the magnitude of the slowing has been somewhat greater than would be expected given the normal evolution of the business cycle," Bernanke said, adding that despite recent weak readings the Fed expects business investment in equipment and software to grow at a moderate pace this year. The weak durable goods report was a surprise to economists, who said this lower demand would weigh down economic growth in the first quarter. "This is very weak," said Chris Rupkey, senior financial economist at Bank of Tokyo/Mitsubishi-UFJ in New York. "This is what it looks like when we are going into a recession. I'll be surprised if we don't." Economists polled ahead of the report were expecting overall durable goods orders to advance by 3.5 percent and by 1.6 percent, excluding transportation. The Commerce Department revised down its figures for January, reporting a 9.3 percent decline in overall durable orders in January, first recorded as a 7.8 percent decrease. The sharp drop in January durable goods orders reported a month ago helped spark a big sell-off in U.S. equities and raised concerns at the Fed that business spending might prove weaker than they had expected. February data on business investment is likely to keep those concerns alive. RECESSION SIGNAL? In a further sign of weak demand, orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft, viewed as a proxy for business spending, fell 1.2 percent last month after declining 7.4 percent in January. Economists were expecting a 2.3 percent gain. "This weak report suggests that, at best, equipment spending will be flat relative to the fourth quarter, which we know was down from the third quarter. It represents a manufacturing recession but, also, just a general sense of corporate caution where business expectations fell through most of 2006," said Cary Leahey, managing director and economist at Decision Economics in New York. The rise in overall durable goods orders could be largely attributed to an 88.4 percent surge in nondefense aircraft and parts orders and a 29.2 percent gain in defense aircraft orders. Automotive orders advanced 1.3 percent in February. A 0.8 percent decline in shipments in February is sure to drag down gross domestic product growth during the quarter. Amid a spate of troubles in the subprime mortgage market that has led to the collapse of many mortgage lenders, separate data showed U.S. mortgage applications declined last week as refinancing dipped while purchase activity barely budged. The Mortgage Bankers Association said its seasonally adjusted index of mortgage applications dipped 0.2 percent to 671.0 last week. The MBA's seasonally adjusted purchase index climbed 0.1 percent to 411.1. Its refinancing applications index slipped 0.5 percent to 2,197.7. Mortgage application levels are being scrutinized as rising foreclosures and other problems in the subprime mortgage market causes lenders to clamp down on loans to borrowers with weak credit.
