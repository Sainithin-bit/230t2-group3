 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Victoria's Secret Stores President and Chief Operating Officer Mark Weikel will join Lord and Taylor as chief operating officer, effective April 9, the department store operator said on Wednesday. 

 Lord and Taylor said Weikel would report to President and CEO Jane Elfers. Lingerie chain Victoria's Secret and parent company Limited Brands Inc. ( LTD.N ) have seen a slew of promotions and departures since the beginning of the year. Pink, a division of Victoria's Secret, recently named a new president, while the chief executive of Victoria's Secret direct-to-consumer division left the company in January. Victoria's Secret Stores named a new chief executive, Lori Greeley, in January, and the company said then that she and Weikel would be its "co-leadership team." Weikel had been COO of the division since 2003 and was promoted to president upon Greeley's hiring. Weikel's duties will be assumed by Victoria's Secret COO Jerry Stritzke until a replacement for Weikel is found, Limited Brands said in an e-mail. The company named Stritzke to his post in May. The head of the Limited Stores chain left his post in January, as did two co-presidents of the company's Express casual clothing chain. A spokeswoman for Limited Brands said the turnover at the company was not out of line for the company with more than 3,700 stores. "It's just people moving to other roles and, in many cases, to bigger jobs, and fortunately, we have deep bench strength," spokeswoman Jennifer Ortiz wrote in an e-mail to Reuters.
