 PHILADELPHIA  (Reuters) - Pennsylvania's two largest health insurers, Highmark Inc. and Independence Blue Cross, said they have agreed to merge, creating the third-largest Blue Plan health insurer in the United States. 

 The companies provide health insurance to about 8 million people. In a joint statement on Wednesday, the nonprofit companies said the combination will reduce drug costs by $280 million and generate administrative savings of $300 million. The largest Blue Plan in the United States is WellPoint Inc. ( WLP.N ) with about 30 million members, followed by Health Care Service Corp. with more than 11 million members. Highmark Chief Executive Kenneth Melani will become CEO of the combined company. Joseph Frick, CEO of Independence Blue Cross, will become president and chief operating officer. Frick said the new company, which will employ about 18,000 people and be headquartered in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, will be in a better position to contain rising health care costs. "By combining our two organizations, we will be better able to maintain affordable programs, meet shifting consumer demands for new products and fund essential technological and infrastructure improvements," Frick said. Acting Pennsylvania Insurance Commissioner Randy Rohrbaugh said in a statement regulators will seek to ensure consumer protection in their evaluation of the deal. The companies will seek approval for the transaction from state and federal regulators starting in April and will operate separately until the deal is cleared, the statement said.
