 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - "M" is coming to the New York Stock Exchange. 

 No, not the famed fictional head of British intelligence from the James Bond series. Retailer Federated Department Stores Inc. FD.N said on Wednesday it plans to adopt "M" as its stock symbol when shareholders approve its proposed name change to Macy's Inc. Shareholders are scheduled to vote on the name change on May 18 and the stock symbol change would go into effect on June 1. The retailer proposed the change of its symbol to reflect the change of its business. Ninety percent of Federated's sales now come from the Macy's brand, the company said. In recent years the company changed the names of many regional department stores it owns to Macy's. Federated management originally planned to ask shareholders to change the name to Macy's Group Inc., but simplified that to Macy's Inc. when it found it could have the coveted single-letter stock symbol. While "M" may be best known as the name of James Bond's boss in Ian Fleming's novels and the many blockbuster movies, in the financial world, "M" was seen as part of a different plot -- real or imagined. The New York Stock Exchange was long thought to be saving the "M" symbol to lure Microsoft Corp. ( MSFT.O ) away from rival Nasdaq. "That has been a matter of speculation, something we have not had to address," New York Stock Exchange spokesman Christiaan Brakman said. "'M' will be for Macy's." The symbol "M" has been unused since 1989, when it represented Texas bank holding company M Corp., which went under that year. With the symbol "M" gone, 10 single letters remain available: G, I, J, L, N, P, U, V, W, and Z. Single-letter symbols have been seen as carrying considerable cachet. Among the long-time holders of such symbols are Ford Motor Co. (F) ( F.N ) and U.S. Steel Corp. (X)  ( X.N ). "This is another important opportunity to reinforce the recent expansion of the Macy's brand," Terry Lundgren, Federated Chairman and Chief Executive, said in a news release. Federated shares closed on Tuesday at $46.23 on the New York Stock exchange. Oh, and for James Bond fans, sorry -- "Q" is already taken. Not by a gadget maker, but by regional phone company Qwest Communications International Inc. ( Q.N )
