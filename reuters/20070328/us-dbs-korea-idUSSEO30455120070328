 SINGAPORE/SEOUL  (Reuters) - DBS Group Holdings ( DBSM.SI ) is talking to investors about buying Korea Exchange Bank, sources close to the deal said on Wednesday, the second time the Singapore bank is eyeing the $10 billion Korean lender. 

 The Singapore bank, Southeast Asia's largest, is working to form a consortium with South Korean bank Nonghyup to buy KEB 004940.KS from U.S. buyout fund Lone Star LS.UL, one of the sources familiar with the situation told Reuters. KEB is controlled by U.S. buyout fund Lone Star and is one of the few remaining targets in South Korea's banking sector for foreign buyers seeking growth. But a legal battle over Lone Star's 2003 purchase of KEB has put a sale on hold. "DBS has always wanted to buy a Korean bank. But the thing was the (South Korean) government did not want that to happen," a source said, asking not to be identified. "Both DBS and Nonghyup will likely become top shareholders in KEB (if the deal goes through), but it is more likely that Nonghyup has more shares (in the partnership)." He added DBS was in informal negotiations with Lone Star LS.UL, which has a 64.62 percent stake in KEB. Another source said a deal was unlikely to happen this week. Shares in DBS fell more than 3 percent on the news amid weak stock markets across Asia. KEB shares were 1.3 percent higher at 15,100 won by 0507 GMT. DBS, in which Singapore's state investor Temasek Holdings TEM.UL has a 28 percent stake, declined to comment but said it was looking for growth opportunities. A Lone Star spokeswoman in Seoul and Nonghyup also declined to comment. "We are always on the lookout for organic and inorganic opportunities that are accretive to our shareholders, and which extend our Asia banking franchise," DBS said. Last year, DBS bid for KEB, South Korea's fifth-biggest lender, but dropped out after the local regulator classified Temasek as a non-banking group, which would bar DBS from becoming a top shareholder in a South Korean bank. "They made a bid last year, and they have been looking around for a while and there are not that many opportunities," said Tony Raza, an analyst at Merrill Lynch. "They had pretty strong earnings in the second half, I suspect investors may be more receptive this time round." Forming a consortium with a domestic financial group is also likely to help stem a possible political backlash against foreign capital for increasing stakes in the financial sector and making a fortune. "DBS should still be interested in KEB and forming a consortium is a way to skirt the qualification issue," said Koo Kyung-hwe, an analyst at Hyundai Securities. "The buyout price is likely to go higher this time, given KEB's increased asset value and profits so far." Lone Star picked top South Korean lender Kookmin Bank 060000.KS to buy KEB last year, but scrapped the $7.3 billion sale in November due to escalating legal conflicts. That price tag is sharply lower than the current market value of $10 billion. The resumption of the sale is unlikely to come soon, analysts say, as a local court is still reviewing whether the 2003 deal to sell KEB to Lone Star was valid. Lone Star in February secured a $445 million dividend payout from KEB after last year's sale failed. Lone Star owns 64.62 percent of KEB and can sell up to a 70.87 percent stake by exercising options with other investors. Kookmin has said it would try to buy KEB if it is put up for sale again. A Kookmin spokesman said the bank was not aware of any discussions about the DBS-led consortium. Hana Financial Group ( 086790.KS ), South Korea's fourth-ranked lender and one of the previous bidders for KEB, said it had not been contacted by DBS.
