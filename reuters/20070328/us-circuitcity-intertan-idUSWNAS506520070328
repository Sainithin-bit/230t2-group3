 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Circuit City Stores Inc. CC.N said it has hired Goldman Sachs to explore strategic options for a possible unit sale and will replace 3,400 store employees with lower-paid workers, sending its shares up on Wednesday. 

 The consumer electronics retailer, which is in the midst of a multiyear effort to revamp its business and win back market share from larger rival Best Buy Co. Inc. ( BBY.N ), said it may sell off InterTAN Inc., the Canadian retailer it acquired in 2004. Circuit City is trying to reduce expenses in order to offset gross margin pressure in the competitive flat-panel television business. Analysts applauded the cost-cutting but said the move may prove to be good news for Best Buy. "While we view these cost cuts as clearly good for near-term earnings, they are not necessarily the way to drive longer-term operational success," said Bernstein analyst Colin McGranahan. "It stands to reason that firing 3,400 of arguably the most successful sales people in the company could prove terrible for morale," he added. Circuit City also said it signed a seven-year deal worth $775 million with IBM Corp. ( IBM.N ) to outsource its information technology infrastructure services. The company said the deal will begin to generate savings in fiscal 2008 and reduce IT costs by more than 16 percent over the length of the contract. About 50 of its 130 internal IT infrastructure workers will join IBM and remain on site serving its contract, while the other 80 will support the transition in the short term, the company said. Circuit City shares were up 2.86 percent, or 54 cents at $19.42 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. LOWER LABOR COSTS "We expect to deliver improvements in our selling, general and administrative expense rate while maintaining appropriate investments to drive our key strategic initiatives such as digital home services, multichannel and home entertainment," said Chief Executive Philip Schoonover in a statement. The company, which also increased the number of planned store closures to about 65 from 60, said it expects pretax expenses of about $144 million in the fourth quarter related to store closures, goodwill impairment and other restructuring activities. The retailer also lowered its 2007 outlook for sales growth to 8 percent from its prior forecast of 9 to 10 percent. Circuit City said that 8.5 percent of store employees, "who were paid well above the market-based salary range for their role," will be "separated" from the company and replaced by new workers compensated at the current market range. McGranahan said that Circuit City had already once shifted from a highly paid workforce that earned commissions to one based on lower-paid hourly workers. "The prior occurrence had a dramatically negative impact on sales, and a significant risk exists that the same will happen again," the analyst for Bernstein said in a research note. The Richmond, Virginia-based company said it expects greater sales volatility during the first half of fiscal 2008 due to the changes it is implementing, but spokesman Bill Cimino said the higher-paid workers were not necessarily the most experienced and that there was not always a correlation between salary and customer service. He noted that the company has plans in place to quickly train new employees to improve the level of execution prior to the all-important holiday season.
