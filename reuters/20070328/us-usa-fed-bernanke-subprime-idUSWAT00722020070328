 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Troubles in the subprime mortgage market seem to be having a "moderate" impact on the housing market and so far are minimal for the economy, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said on Wednesday. 

 "So far we have not seen any significant indications that this has spilled over into other credit markets," Bernanke said while taking questions after delivering remarks to the congressional Joint Economic Committee. "We are watching that very carefully." He said the Fed needs clarity on its authority to regulate non-bank mortgage lenders and advised Congress to explore new ways to regulate mortgage lending standards.
