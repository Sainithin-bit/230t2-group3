 MONTREAL  (Reuters) - Bombardier Inc. ( BBDb.TO ) reported a slightly higher quarterly profit on Wednesday as a robust business jet market offset weak regional aircraft sales. 

 Bombardier, the world's top train maker and third-largest manufacturer of civil aircraft, said it earned $112 million, or 6 cents a share, in the fourth quarter ended January 31, compared with $86 million, or 5 cents a share, a year earlier. Analysts had forecast profit of 5 cents a share before special items, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue rose to $4.4 billion from $4 billion. Manufacturing revenue was higher for business aircraft, but lower for regional aircraft, the company said. It also had higher revenue for rolling stock. Bombardier said it expected total aircraft deliveries to rise in fiscal 2008 from the 326 made in fiscal 2007. In fiscal 2006, Bombardier had delivered 337 aircraft. Bombardier's class B shares rose 3 Canadian cents to C$4.61 on the Toronto Stock Exchange on Tuesday afternoon. The stock had risen about 38 percent over the past six months, largely on the firm outlook for sales of business jets. ($1=$1.16 Canadian)
