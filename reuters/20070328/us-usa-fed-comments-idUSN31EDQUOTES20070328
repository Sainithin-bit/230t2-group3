 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The following is a summary of recent comments by Fed policy-makers: 

 * Denotes 2007 voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets U.S. monetary policy. * FED CHAIRMAN BEN BERNANKE, MARCH 28: "Our policy is still oriented toward control of inflation, which we consider to be at this time to be the greater risk," he told the congressional Joint Economic Committee. "I would say it would be more accurate to say that we are looking for a bit more flexibility given the uncertainties that we are facing and the risks that are occurring on both sides of our outlook." "To the downside, the correction in the housing market could turn out to be more severe than we currently expect, perhaps exacerbated by problems in the subprime sector. Moreover, we could yet see greater spillover from the weakness in housing to employment and consumer spending than has occurred thus far. The possibility that the recent weakness in business investment will persist is an additional downside risk. To the upside, consumer spending -- which has proved quite resilient despite the housing downturn and increases in energy prices -- might continue to grow at a brisk pace, stimulating a more rapid economic expansion than we currently anticipate." * CHICAGO FED PRESIDENT MICHAEL MOSKOW, MARCH 26: "We all think (core inflation above 2 percent for three years) is too high. It gets built into expectations and then it's very hard to control, very hard to reduce. So inflation is our predominant concern," he told students at Tsinghua University in Beijing. "We believe that there's enough slack already built into the economy in 2007 to enable us to have lower inflation in 2008 and at the end of 2007." * FED GOVERNOR FREDERIC MISHKIN, MARCH 23: "I am less optimistic about the prospects for core PCE inflation to move much below 2 percent in the absence of a determined effort by monetary policy," he said at a conference at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. "A substantial further decline in inflation would require a shift in expectations, and such a shift could be difficult and time consuming to bring about." PHILADELPHIA FED PRESIDENT CHARLES PLOSSER, MARCH 23: "The last couple of months' (inflation) numbers are not encouraging. We had seen some abatement of inflation but don't see that recently," he said at a bankers' conference in Palm Beach, Florida. * NEW YORK FED PRESIDENT TIMOTHY GEITHNER, MARCH 23: "There are few signs that the disruptions in this one sector of the credit markets (high-risk mortgages) will have a lasting impact on credit markets as a whole," he said at a Richmond Fed credit market symposium. * FED GOVERNOR RANDALL KROSZNER, MARCH 22: "I want to emphasize that the fundamental risks in credit markets have not been changed by the new instruments that are now being traded. Credit risks may be traded among market participants, but that does not eliminate risk," he said at a Richmond Fed conference on credit markets. FEDERAL OPEN MARKET COMMITTEE, MARCH 21: "Recent indicators have been mixed and the adjustment in the housing sector is ongoing. Nevertheless, the economy seems likely to continue to expand at a moderate pace over coming quarters. "Recent readings on core inflation have been somewhat elevated. Although inflation pressures seem likely to moderate over time, the high level of resource utilization has the potential to sustain those pressures. "In these circumstances, the Committee's predominant policy concern remains the risk that inflation will fail to moderate as expected. Future policy adjustments will depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming information." * FED GOVERNOR RANDALL KROSZNER, MARCH 12: "The near-term inflation outlook is more likely to be dominated by cost factors, such as productivity growth and the price of raw materials, than by the tightness of labor and product markets," he said in remarks to the National Association for Business Economics in Arlington, Virginia. RICHMOND FED PRESIDENT JEFFREY LACKER, MARCH 9: "One might question whether inflation expectations are anchored closely enough to the price stability shore," he said at a conference in Washington on monetary policy. "If inflation expectations are forward-looking, a central bank has the opportunity to move expectations in the right direction though clear communication reinforced by appropriate actions, and a more rapid return to price stability would be warranted." * FED VICE CHAIRMAN DONALD KOHN, MARCH 9: "Inflation expectations are critical: increases in expectations of inflation elevate the cost of returning to price stability. And unanchored expectations make it very difficult to understand where the economy is and where it is going."
