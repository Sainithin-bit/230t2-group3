 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson on Wednesday said the biggest economic challenge for the United States is the widening income gap between rich and poor. 

 "What I think about the most when I say, 'What is the greatest challenge' is the widening income gap. And as I've looked at that, I believe it's largely attributable to technology," Paulson told a House Appropriations subcommittee. He said those with the skills to be able to use and access technology have far better income potential than those who lack such skills.
