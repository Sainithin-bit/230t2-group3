 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said on Wednesday he sees signs that the U.S. housing market downturn may have reached a bottom, and the economic damage from housing may be contained. 

 "There are some encouraging signs that we're at or near the bottom" of the housing market, Paulson said in a question and answer session in testimony to the financial services subcommittee of the U.S. House Appropriations Committee. "It looks to me like the housing issue is going to be contained," Paulson said, adding that some concerns remained about foreclosures in the subprime mortgage market. He said, however, these concerns must be balanced against the benefits that subprime loans have brought, enabling many Americans to buy homes they otherwise would not have been able to afford. "We're looking at this carefully from all angles," he said.
