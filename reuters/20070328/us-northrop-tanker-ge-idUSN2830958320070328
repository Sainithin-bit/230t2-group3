 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Northrop Grumman Corp. ( NOC.N ) on Wednesday said it picked General Electric Co.'s ( GE.N ) CF6-80E1 engine to power the KC-30 aerial refueling tanker, which Northrop and European partner EADS ( EAD.PA ) are proposing in a $40 billion U.S. Air Force competition. 

 "Northrop Grumman conducted a rigorous downselect process to choose the best engine at the lowest risk for the KC-30," which is based on the Airbus A330 built by EADS, Northrop said in a statement. It said the GE engine was reliable, efficient and had amassed more than 3.6 million flight hours with A330 aircraft. It said GE engines currently power more than 80 percent of the U.S. Air Force tanker fleet. The high-stakes competition is to build a first batch of 179 tankers. Northrop said EADS would provide the aircraft -- the A330-200 -- and the air-refueling boom system for the tanker, which will carry 45,000 more pounds of fuel than the Air Force's current fleet of KC-135s. Northrop said its other partners on the tanker program include Sargent Fletcher Inc., the U.S. division of Cobham Plc ( COB.L ); Honeywell International Inc. ( HON.N ); Smiths Aerospace; Parker Aerospace, a unit of Parker Hannifin ( PH.N ); AAR Cargo Systems; and Telephonics Corp. Boeing Co. ( BA.N ) is pitching its 767 tanker against the Northrop-EADS proposal and has picked Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies Corp ( UTX.N ), to power its KC-767 tanker. Australia, Britain and the United Arab Emirates have picked the EADS A330 platform for their tanker programs, while Boeing is building its tanker for Italy and Japan. The tanker replacement program is the Air Force's No. 1 acquisition priority. It has been dragged out for years after a procurement scandal killed a $23.5 billion Air Force sole-source plan to lease and buy 100 Boeing KC-767s. Replacing over 500 existing tankers over the next four decades could be worth more than $200 billion. Tanker proposals must be submitted to the Air Force by April 12, with a contract award expected by the end of 2007.
