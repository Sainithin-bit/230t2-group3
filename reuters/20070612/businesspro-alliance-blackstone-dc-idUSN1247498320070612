 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. antitrust authorities said on 
Tuesday they had approved plans by Blackstone Group LP BG.UL 
to buy Alliance Data Systems Corp. ( ADS.N ) for $6.76 billion. 

  Officials have completed their investigation of the deal 
without taking action, the Federal Trade Commission said in a 
notice.  Dallas-based Alliance Data is a business services company 
providing transaction, credit and marketing services, an 
industry that has attracted heavy interest from private equity 
buyers lately.
