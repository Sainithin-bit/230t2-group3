 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Investment bank Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. LEH.N, said on Tuesday second quarter profit rose, helped by a surge in investment banking revenue. 

 Lehman, the fourth-largest U.S. investment bank by market value, said net income rose to $1.27 billion, or $2.21 a share, for the three months ended May 31, compared with $1 billion, or $1.69 a share a year earlier. Analysts had on average expected earnings before special items of $1.87 a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Lehman Brothers has missed out on the stock market rally that began in March, as investors have fretted about the company's exposure to home loans made to people with poor credit. Such subprime mortgages have suffered from rising defaults recently. Lehman says its exposure to subprime mortgages is small. From March 1 through Monday's close, the Standard & Poor's 500 index  .SPX  has risen more than 7.5 percent, while Lehman's shares have risen just 3.3 percent.
