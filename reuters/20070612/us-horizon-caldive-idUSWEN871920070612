 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Cal Dive International Inc. ( DVR.N ) said on Monday it agreed to acquire Horizon Offshore Inc. HOFF.O for $628 million in a deal to diversify the oil service company's fleet. 

 The deal calls for Horizon stockholders to receive a combination of 0.625 shares of Cal Dive common stock and $9.25 in cash for each share of Horizon common stock. The deal will also include about $22 million of Horizon's debt. Based on Cal Dive's closing stock price on June 11, the price equates to a transaction value of about $19.25 per Horizon share, or a premium of about 14 percent to Horizon's closing price, the company said. It said the deal is expected to close in the third quarter.
