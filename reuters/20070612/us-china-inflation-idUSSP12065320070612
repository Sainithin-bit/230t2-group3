 BEIJING  (Reuters) - Surging food prices boosted China's annual consumer price inflation in May to a 27-month high, extending a rising trend and reinforcing expectations that interest rates will rise further. 

 Inflation quickened to 3.4 percent last month from 3 percent in April, the National Bureau of Statistics said on Tuesday. Food prices, which make up a third of the consumer basket, rose 8.3 percent from a year earlier and a shortage of pork caused meat prices to jump 26.5 percent. The overall inflation figure was in line with forecasts, but Shanghai's main stock market index fell more than 2 percent at one point on expectations of tighter monetary policy before regaining ground. "We expect tighter monetary policy in the coming months given heightened inflation risks and negative real interest rates," economists at Goldman Sachs said in a note to clients. Non-food inflation remained subdued, with prices up just 1 percent from a year earlier, but economists said the data reinforced the case for further central bank tightening. Yi Xianrong, an economist with the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS), the government's premier think-tank, agreed that a third interest rate rise this year was now inevitable. The price of pork, China's staple meat, soared in May as a result of a widespread pig disease and a spike in the price of feedcorn. Alert to the potential for popular unease over inflation, Premier Wen Jiabao showed his concern by making a high-profile visit to a pork market in northwestern China. Putting aside the special reasons affecting pork, Yi at CASS said the leap in food prices rises was inevitable. "You just look around -- many things are getting pricey and liquidity is flooding into China, so why wouldn't food prices go up?" Central bank governor Zhou Xiaochuan, aiming to keep 2007 inflation below 3 percent, had said he would await the May inflation figures before deciding whether to raise rates again. Central banks usually do not respond to shocks to the supply of food and energy as long as they do not push other prices and wages higher. In China's case, economists said Zhou faced a tricky decision given the torrents of cash pouring into the banking system from the country's record trade surplus. "Earlier this year it was eggs and poultry and now it's maybe the pork prices, and monetary conditions are simply too loose to prevent these supply shocks from spiking prices," said Tim Condon of ING Financial in Singapore. The rise in pork prices would probably prove transitory, but the central bank would remain on alert, Condon said. (Additional reporting by  Tamora Vidaillet )
