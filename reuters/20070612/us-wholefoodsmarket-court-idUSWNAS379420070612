 (Reuters) - A federal court will on July 31 begin a preliminary injunction hearing on U.S. antitrust authorities' bid to block Whole Foods Market Inc.'s WFMI.O proposed acquisition of rival Wild Oats Markets Inc. OATS.O, the companies said. 

 The hearing is scheduled to conclude on August 1, the grocery chains said in a statement. The Federal Trade Commission had said it would challenge the transaction because it would eliminate competition between "two uniquely close competitors" in many local markets around the United States.
