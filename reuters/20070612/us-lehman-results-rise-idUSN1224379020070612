 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. LEH.N on Tuesday said quarterly profit rose 27 percent, beating expectations, on surging revenue from bond underwriting and stock trading. 

 Lehman Chief Executive Richard Fuld Jr. has focused more of Lehman's efforts overseas and invested heavily in businesses ranging from merger advisory to asset management to equities trading, to diversify a company that traditionally relied heavily on bond underwriting and trading for profits. With newer businesses turning in double-digit revenue growth, Lehman's overall revenue rose 25 percent despite weakness in the U.S. mortgage market, which contributed to a 14 percent decline in bond trading revenue. Lehman's shares have underperformed the broader market for much of this year, hurt by concerns about Lehman's exposure to U.S. home loans made to people with weaker credit, known as subprime mortgages. But Tuesday's results eased those fears and the company's shares were up more than 2 percent in early trading on the New York Stock Exchange. "The worriers probably worried too much," said James Ellman, president of financial services hedge fund Seacliff Capital, which owns Lehman shares. Speaking on a conference call, Lehman's chief financial officer Christopher O'Meara said there are still headwinds affecting the U.S. subprime mortgage market, but that there are some positive signs there, including clients growing more active in trading bonds backed by the home loans. The fourth-largest U.S. investment bank by market value said net income rose to $1.27 billion, or $2.21 a share, for the second quarter ended on May 31 from $1 billion, or $1.69, a year earlier. That easily beat the analysts' average forecast of $1.87 a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue rose to $5.5 billion from $4.4 billion. Stock trading revenue jumped 94 percent to $1.7 billion, helped in part by record trading from customers and profitable trades with the company's own funds. Lehman has not changed its business model with respect to taking some risk with its own money but still mainly focusing on client trades, CFO O'Meara told Reuters in an interview. "We're in the business of risk taking, but it's still a client-focused model," O'Meara said. In equities trading, customer activity grew across the board, especially in trading outside the U.S., O'Meara said. The overall pipeline of fees that Lehman stands to earn from underwriting securities or advising on mergers doubled to $1.6 billion at the end of the quarter from the beginning of the year. MORE OVERSEAS Lehman has dramatically boosted foreign revenue across the firm -- for the second quarter, 48 percent of the company's revenues were from outside the United States, compared with 37 percent for the whole of fiscal 2006. Bond underwriting revenue rose more than 85 percent. Bond trading revenue fell by 14 percent, hurt by weakness in the U.S. mortgage market as well as lower revenue from municipal bonds and interest-rate products. Return on equity, a measure of the company's effectiveness at wringing profit out of its equity capital, rose to 25.8 percent from 23.7 percent a year earlier. Brad Hintz, an analyst at Sanford Bernstein, said Lehman's return on equity for the quarter was likely close to that of rival Goldman Sachs Group ( GS.N ), which reports results on Thursday. But the price-to-book ratio for Lehman, a share valuation measure, is only about 2.1, about two-thirds the value of Goldman's. That large difference signals Lehman's valuation may have scope to rise closer to Goldman's, Hintz said. From March 1 through Monday's close, Lehman's shares had risen just 3.3 percent, less than half the 7.5 percent gain in the Standard & Poor's 500 index  .SPX , as investors fretted about Lehman's subprime mortgage exposure. Lehman has said that its exposure to subprime mortgages is small. The company's shares were up $1.17 to $76.85 in afternoon trade on the New York Stock Exchange.
