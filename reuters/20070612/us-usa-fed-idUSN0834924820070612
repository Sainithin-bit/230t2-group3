 CODY, Wyoming  (Reuters) - Cody is a long way from the marble hallways of the Federal Reserve in Washington, but its fortunes will not be ignored when policy-makers meet to debate interest rates later this month. 

 The remote rural community of about 9,000 inhabitants at the eastern gateway to Yellowstone National Park was recently scrutinized by the Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank as it searched for clues on the health of the U.S. economy. "Whether you call it the intuitive analysis that follows the hard analysis, it adds texture, it adds information. It is critical for decision-making," Kansas City Fed President Thomas Hoenig told Reuters. The U.S. central bank's 12 regional branches conduct intensive discussions with local businesses to glean evidence on how the economy is performing and to look for insights weeks or even months before national data is published. In turn, the regional Fed bank presidents present these findings, together with their own research and judgments, when the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee meets at the Fed's Washington headquarters about every six weeks. Hoenig hosted a two-day road trip to Cody with the board of directors from the Kansas City Fed's Denver branch to take the pulse of the economy in this corner of his far-flung district. Each regional Fed is responsible for surveying the economy and supervising banks in a number of states. The Kansas City district consists of Wyoming, Nebraska, Colorado, Kansas, Oklahoma, northern New Mexico and western Missouri. NAVY SEAL Their first port of call was a pharmaceuticals laboratory founded seven years ago by Ric Asherman, a former Navy SEAL who invented a chest dressing still used by U.S. armed forces. Low taxes drew Asherman to Cody. Wyoming does not have a state income, corporate or inheritance tax, and its sales tax is capped at 5 percent. But Asherman also liked the fact that his valuable merchandise was much more secure out here than in a big city. "There are only a couple of roads going in and out of town, with nothing in between," he told the group of visitors. "The police can seal it off in two minutes. Asherman employs around 40 staff, including Vladimir Kuznetsov, a Russian-born chemist who has invented a new way of producing certain active ingredients used in pain killers. This really got Hoenig's attention. "This Russian scientist developed a method that I would not begin to understand. But what I heard was a 50 percent increase in productivity with the process of the conversion," he said. The Fed is watching productivity trends carefully because it impacts whether firms can lift output without adding labor and other inputs that could put upward pressure on inflation. Hoenig said the anecdotal evidence he heard in Cody was the kind of feedback that encouraged him to believe that a slowdown in U.S. productivity growth would be temporary. In the first quarter, U.S. nonfarm business productivity grew at a slim 1 percent annual rate, well off the 2.5 percent pace the economy enjoyed during the late-1990s boom. "Reducing costs. Increasing output. That is still going on ... So my sense is that those things are still in place," Hoenig said. "I think the productivity numbers will rebound. I think we'll see that rebound in the second quarter." EAR TO THE GROUND The scale of these countrywide economic focus groups set the Fed apart from other central banks and have yielded important breakthroughs for monetary policy in the past. Former Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan famously guessed right about the "new" economy in the 1990s when his business contacts convinced him an unmeasured productivity surge was under way. Policy-makers are currently wrestling with the impact of a slumping housing market and whether this will be offset by pick-up in business investment. They hope contacts with businesses will give them an early read on the outcome, and they have their ears pinned back. "Larger manufacturers tied to the home-building industry are pessimistic," said Kristy Schloss, president of Schloss Engineered Equipment and current chairwoman of the Kansas City Fed's Denver branch board of directors. "Costs are increasing sharply, they are not able to pass these along and they don't see any improvement in sight," she told other Denver directors. Nor was the news on housing in Colorado good. "We're still six, nine, 12 months away from seeing upward movement in the housing market, so we have probably not hit bottom yet," said fellow director Bruce Alexander, president and chief executive of Vectra Bank Colorado. But in Wyoming, the story was much more upbeat. The state's energy sector has benefited from high prices, while strong demand for holiday homes in locations like prestigious Jackson Hole have boosted land values and construction. "Wyoming is the land of plenty," Richard Scarlett, chairman and CEO of the Jackson State Bank and Trust, said over dinner at Cassie's, a popular steakhouse and piano bar that curtained off a discreet rear dining area for the Fed visitors. "We've got plenty of gas, plenty of oil and plenty of miles ahead ... Thanks to the interest rates that you all are setting, people are spending and the economy is doing well."
