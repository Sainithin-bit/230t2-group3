 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Citigroup ( C.N ) has raised its stake in Japanese brokerage Nikko Cordial Corp. 8603.T to 68 percent this month from 61 percent, according to a filing to Japan's finance ministry. 

 Citigroup in April secured 61 percent of Nikko Cordial's voting stock in a $7.7 billion tender offer bid, with an aim to eventually turn Japan's third-biggest brokerage into a wholly owned subsidiary. Securing more than a two-thirds stake would give the U.S. banking group better control over Nikko Cordial without worrying about potential veto moves from minority investors. New York-based Citigroup is hoping to recover credibility at the scandal-hit Nikko Cordial, which escaped a threatened delisting by the Tokyo bourse over its accounting mess.
