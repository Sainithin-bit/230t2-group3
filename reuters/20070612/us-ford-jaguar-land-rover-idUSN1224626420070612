 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co. ( F.N ) said on Tuesday it was working with financial advisers on the best options for its European luxury brands Jaguar and Land Rover. 

 "We are working with financial advisers to determine the best future for Jaguar and Land Rover," said John Gardiner, a spokesman for Ford's luxury brands. He declined to name the advisers. Sources familiar with the matter said on Monday that Ford had hired investment banks -- including Goldman Sachs ( GS.N ), HSBC Holdings Plc ( HSBA.L ) and Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ) -- to help the automaker explore the sale of the two brands. Gardiner said Ford's review of its global operations was ongoing and the company was looking at all options. He declined to give a timeline for any decision. Ford, which has faced scrutiny over how it will raise and maintain liquidity as it restructures its money-losing North American operations, could get a cash-infusion from the sale of the two nameplates. Analysts have said that Ford was still burning cash and contract talks with the United Auto Workers union were looming, which strengthens the case for asset sales. The profitability of Ford's luxury brands, dubbed the Premier Automotive Group, has been volatile. Land Rover has said it expects to be profitable this year but Ford has struggled to make money with Jaguar. The brand, known for its leaping cat hood ornament, remains the biggest drag on the results of Ford's luxury division. Ford could raise between $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion through a combined sale of Jaguar and Land Rover, Merrill Lynch analyst John Murphy said. Ford sold Aston Martin in March for $925 million but last month denied that it was in talks to sell Volvo.
