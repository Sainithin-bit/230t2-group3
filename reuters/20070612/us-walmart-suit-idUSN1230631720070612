 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A judge denied class action status for a New York lawsuit claiming Wal-Mart Stores Inc. deprived hourly workers of wages, requiring employees to work "off the clock" before or after their shifts. 

 But in a separate case on Tuesday a judge in the Missouri Court of Appeals partially upheld a lower court decision that gave workers the right to sue the retailer as a group. The cases alleged Wal-Mart understaffed its stores and to make up for the labor shortfall, it required employees to work through their breaks or off the clock without compensation. The New York suit sought class-action status on behalf of about 200,000 current and past hourly New York employees. In a decision dated June 11, State of New York Supreme Court Judge Richard Platkin denied class action status, saying the issues need "individualized inquiry." Speaking of the New York case, Wal-Mart spokesman John Simley said the retailer was "pleased that the trial court ruled in Wal-Mart's favor in every element and denied class certification in this case." Jonathan Selbin, an attorney with Lieff Cabraser Heimann & Bernstein, who worked on behalf of the New York plaintiffs, said the ruling was disappointing. "There's some 200,000 relatively low wage earners who were part of this class and effectively this order means none of these people are going to get their chance to prove their claims," he said. Simley said the retailer was disappointed by the Missouri decision and was exploring its option for an appeal. A lawyer for the plaintiffs in the Missouri case could not immediately be reached for comment. (Additional reporting by  Paritosh Bansal )
