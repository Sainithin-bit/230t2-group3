 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Retailers could see some big changes in their earnings reports and balance sheets, as accounting rulemakers move forward with a project to change the way companies account for leases, a study showed on Tuesday. 

 The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), which sets U.S. accounting rules, voted last year to begin a joint project with the International Accounting Standards Board to reconsider accounting for leases. Companies could eventually be required to recognize leases on their balance sheets, rather than in financial statement footnotes. The study, headed by Georgia Tech Accounting Professor Charles Mulford, applied the expected changes to lease accounting rules to retailers' 2006 earnings. "It is clear that excluding operating leases from the balance sheet causes a material distortion of the financial position of the company," the study's authors wrote. Retailers, who often lease most of their store locations, are likely to see earnings decrease if the change requires companies to capitalize their leases, according to the study on Tuesday from the Georgia Tech Financial Analysis Lab. Under the potential changes, retailers would see earnings reduced because they would have to record interest expenses based on the present value of the leases, and reflect expenses from the way the company pays off its leases over their lifetime. According to the study, under the accounting standard, No. 3 U.S. warehouse club operator BJ's Wholesale Club Inc. BJ.N would have seen earnings from continuing operations fall from $1.40 per share to 28 cents per share. Department store Saks Inc. SKS.N would have seen a loss from continuing operations of 5 cents a share increase to a loss of 44 cents a share, according to the study. "For both companies, the increased interest and amortization expenses were greater than the reduction in rent and income tax expenses," the study read. On average, earnings from continuing operations of the 19 companies profiled would have been reduced by 5.3 percent. In some cases -- including retailers J.C. Penney Co. Inc. ( JCP.N ) and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ( WMT.N ) -- effects from amortization and depreciation of leasing properties under the expected accounting changes were actually less than the rent cost. The study showed that Wal-Mart could have added 3 cents per share to its earnings from continuing operations under the expected changes, while J.C. Penney could have added 11 cents a share. The study also showed companies could see significant changes to the balance sheet if new rules are adopted. The median increase in assets was 14.6 percent for the retailers, while the median increase in liabilities was 26.4 percent, the study showed. FASB members have said they expect the lease accounting project to pick up steam next year, and produce a final standard some time in 2009.
