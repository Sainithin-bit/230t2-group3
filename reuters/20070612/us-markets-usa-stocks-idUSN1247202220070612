 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. stock futures fell on Tuesday as rising bond yields stoked concerns about higher interest rates, while a disappointing outlook from Texas Instruments Inc. soured prospects for the tech sector. 

 The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes rose to 5.19 percent. Analyst say a decisive break above 5.15 percent could spook investors into selling stocks. Bond yields move inversely to prices. "Since the 10-year note broke 5 percent, that's put the market mentality on the defensive," said Andre Bakhos, president of Princeton Financial Group in Princeton, New Jersey, adding: "Texas Instruments has also soured the soup. With Nucor warning earlier yesterday and now Texas instruments, people are wondering who may be next out with a profit warning, while they wrestle with where is the best place to put their money." S&P 500 futures fell 5.3 points, below fair value, a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into account interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the contract. Dow Jones industrial average futures dropped 26 points and Nasdaq 100 futures dropped 5.25 points. Shares of Texas Instruments were down 2.5 percent in Europe after the chip-maker cut the mid-point of its second-quarter revenue target late on Monday. Shares of Starbucks Corp. dropped 1.2 percent in Europe after Goldman Sachs removed the coffee chain operator from its conviction buy list. Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., the fourth-largest U.S. investment bank by market value, is also among stocks to watch, with the brokerage due to post quarterly results before the bell. U.S. stocks ended little changed on Monday as rising oil prices boosted the energy sector but lingering concerns about higher interest rates kept investors on edge. Investors worry that rising rates would increase borrowing costs, making conditions tougher for the deal-making that has provided fuel for stocks, and dragging on a rebound in the hard-hit housing sector.
