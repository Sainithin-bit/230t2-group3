 BEIJING  (Reuters) - It is premature to say that inflation has returned to China, but bank deposit rates need to remain positive in real terms, an economic planning official said on Tuesday. 

 His comment came hours after China said consumer price inflation had risen to a 27-month-high of 3.4 percent in May, intensifying speculation of a fresh interest rate increase. Zhou Wangjun, a deputy director in the price department of the National Development Reform Commission (NDRC), said the rise in inflation was "not too high". But he said interest rate increases were needed when consumer price inflation outstripped deposit rates. "Let's make it simple: we can't put our money in the bank if interest rates are negative. We must at least give deposit holders some interest," Zhou said in a live Web cast on the Chinese government portal www.gov.cn. People's Bank of China Governor Zhou Xiaochuan said last week that the central bank would decide its next policy move after seeing May's inflation figures. China's one-year deposit rate is 3.06 percent before a 20 percent withholding tax is levied. Inflation spurted last month due to food prices, which leaped 8.3 percent. Meat prices alone jumped 26.5 percent. But Zhou said overall inflation was still in check thanks to stable prices for industrial products and services -- which jointly account for two thirds of the CPI basket. Food makes up the rest. "Will food prices increase lead to inflation? I think it is still too early to draw that conclusion," Zhou said. Zhu Xiaoliang, a deputy director in the market operations department of the Ministry of Commerce, said retail prices of pork in 32 Chinese cities had dropped 2.3 percent in the first 10 days of June. Zhou of the NDRC added that increases in the price of beef, lamb and vegetables -- a spillover of dearer pork -- would not be sustained because supplies were abundant. "There's no need to worry about big price increases. The scenario is unlikely to play out," said Zhou.
