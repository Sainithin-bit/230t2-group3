 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said on Tuesday that China's current rate of growth could not continue and added that a boom in global financial market liquidity was near a turning point. 

 "We cannot continue this rate of growth in China and the Third World. This cannot continue indefinitely," Greenspan said in a speech in New York. "Some of these price earnings ratios are 'discounting nirvana.'"
