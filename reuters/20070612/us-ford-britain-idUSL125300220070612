 LONDON  (Reuters) - The British government is in contact with Ford Motor Co ( F.N ) over the possible sale of the U.S. carmaker's Jaguar and Land Rover brands. 

 "We are in touch with the company. We still believe both Land Rover and Jaguar are highly successful companies and will have a highly successful future," a spokesman for Prime Minister Tony Blair said on Tuesday. Sources familiar with the matter said on Monday that Ford had hired investment banks to explore options including the sale of the two luxury British brands. "The government talks to companies about the possible impact on jobs," the spokesman added.
