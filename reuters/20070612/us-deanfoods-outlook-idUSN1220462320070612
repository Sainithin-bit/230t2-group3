 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Dean Foods Co., the nation's largest processor and distributor of milk and dairy products, cut its profit forecast on Tuesday due to soaring costs for raw milk, sending its shares down as much as 5.5 percent. 

 Raw milk prices are increasingly likely to reach all-time highs by the third quarter, which will be "particularly challenging," Dean said in a statement. Arun Daniel, an analyst at ING Investment Management, said it could take some time for raw milk prices to moderate, noting higher grain prices that drive up the cost of feeding dairy cows, and increasing demand from emerging markets. The increasing use of corn to produce ethanol is helping to drive up corn prices. "You have higher corn prices. That is just a fact. That is not going anywhere," Daniel said. "The demand from emerging markets isn't going away any time soon." Dean said it now expects to earn 30 cents to 31 cents per share, before special items, in the second quarter, down from a previous forecast of 37 cents to 38 cents. For the full year, it expects $1.52 to $1.58 per share, down from a prior estimate of $1.72 to $1.78. Analysts' average forecasts were 37 cents a share for the second quarter and $1.69 for the full year, according to Reuters Estimates. "Though we expected a haircut, we did not envision earnings dropping this low," Bear Stearns analyst Terry Bivens said in a research note. Bivens rates Dean shares "outperform." Higher milk costs are leading to increased prices for dairy products, including cheese and ice cream. Dean said its Horizon Organic brand is facing increased competition in the organic milk market because of an oversupply of raw organic milk. A change in regulations has encouraged more farmers to produce raw organic milk, forcing prices lower, it said. Until recently, the U.S. organic milk market was characterized by shortages as consumer demand outstripped supply. Dean said it would spend aggressively to promote the Horizon brand to maintain market share. Sales at WhiteWave Foods, through which Dean sells its organic and soy milk products, grew 7 percent during the first quarter and is one of the company's focus areas for growth. In 2006, WhiteWave accounted for $1.28 billion of Dean's total sales of $10.1 billion. Dean Foods CEO Gregg Engles has said he expects a 40 percent increase in the supply of organic milk in 2007, creating 25 million excess gallons. However, Dean said the oversupply situation is short term. Dean shares were down $1.43 to $31.03 in morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange after falling as low as $30.66 earlier in the session.
