 PHILADELPHIA  (Reuters) - A group led by Penn National 
Gaming Inc. ( PENN.O ) and hedge fund D.E. Shaw is considering 
making a cash and stock offer for casino company Harrah's 
Entertainment Inc. HET.N, a source familiar with the 
situation said on Tuesday. 

  Lehman Brothers LEH.N and Wachovia Corp. WB.N would 
provide financing and have some equity in the company if a deal 
went ahead, the source said.  CNBC first reported the news of the possible bid by Penn 
National, the third-largest gaming company in the United 
States. Terms of the potential offer were not immediately 
available.  Talk of a new offer for Harrah's comes almost two months 
after private equity firms Apollo Management and Texas Pacific 
Group offered to buy the casino operator for about $15 billion. 
The two firms have since raised their offer to about $15.5 
billion.  Penn National, which owns and operates horse-racing parks 
and casinos, has a market capitalization of $3.3 billion. That 
is a fraction of the $14.2 billion market capitalization of 
Harrah's, which owns or manages more than 40 casinos under the 
Harrah's, Caesars and Horseshoe brand names.  Harrah's, which has said only that a committee of 
non-management directors is reviewing the original bid, 
declined comment on Tuesday.  A representative for Penn did not immediately return a call 
seeking comment. D.E. Shaw declined comment. Representatives 
for Wachovia and Lehman were not immediately available.  Shares of Penn National closed at $38.16, down 58 cents, or 
1.5 percent. Shares of Harrah's closed at $78.46, up $1.91 or 
2.5 percent.  (Reporting by  Jessica Hall  in Philadelphia; Caroline Humer
