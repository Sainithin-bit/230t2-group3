 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Luxury jeweler Tiffany & Co. Inc. ( TIF.N ) reported a 22 percent rise in quarterly profit on Wednesday and said holiday sales growth was above expectations so far, sending its stock up as much as 7 percent. 

 Strength in the quarter was seen in higher-end jewelry, including some of the company's diamond collections, Tiffany said. Net income rose to $29.1 million, or 21 cents a share, in the third quarter, ended October 31, from $23.8 million, or 16 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, earnings were 17 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Analysts polled by Reuters Estimates were expecting 16 cents. "Our earnings estimates are a bit more aggressive than where the street is at, so we want to get a better sense of how the momentum is maintained heading into December, which is the most critical period," said James Hurley, a managing director and luxury goods analyst at Telsey Advisory Group. Hurley said Tiffany's holiday outlook is bright, with the company being the busiest luxury retailer he saw in multiple locations on Black Friday, which is typically not a big sales day for upscale merchandisers. Telsey Advisory Group does not rate stocks, said Hurley, who does not own any shares of Tiffany. New York-based Tiffany, which operates more than 150 stores and boutiques around the world, said sales in November were ahead of expectations for the November-December holiday season. "Comparable-store sales growth in the United States is currently exceeding our high-single-digit expectation, and international comp-store sales growth is exceeding our mid- single-digit expectation," Michael Kowalski, chairman and chief executive, said in a statement. "It's a good start to the season, but the vast majority of holiday business is still ahead of us." International retail sales rose 9 percent to $221.7 million, despite weakness in Japan, which saw an 8 percent decline in net sales and a 9 percent drop in comparable store sales. "Tiffany can't control the Japanese economy, but is working to change what it can -- the selling culture in Japan and improving its store base there," CIBC analyst Dorothy Lakner said in a research note. "Longer term we see improvement in Japan and new growth in silver as positives for sales and margins," wrote Lakner, who has a "sector outperformer" rating on Tiffany stock. Results in the latest period included income from the sale of investment stakes in an online retailer and a manufacturer. Tiffany said both investments were written off in previous years. Third-quarter sales rose 10 percent to $547.8 million. Sales at stores open at least a year rose 4 percent. Tiffany, which has raised prices on some jewelry to offset higher costs for precious metals, said gross margin slipped to 53.6 percent of sales from 54.1 percent a year earlier, hurt by higher costs. The company also said wholesale sales of diamonds hurt margins. Tiffany sells diamonds at wholesale that do not meet its standards, the company said. Tiffany now expects full-year earnings of $1.79 to $1.84 per share, up 2 cents from a forecast it gave in August. Analysts, on average, expect $1.77 per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Tiffany shares were up $2.16 at $38.09, their highest in seven months, in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. At Tuesday's close, the stock was trading at 17.9 times next year's estimated earnings, compared with a multiple of 13.2 for lower-priced jeweler Zale Corp. ( ZLC.N ).
