 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Cosmetics maker Revlon Inc. ( REV.N ) said on Wednesday it plans to launch a $100 million equity offering, largely backstopped by majority owner Ronald Perelman, and refinance an existing credit agreement. 

 It said the steps are part of its plan to improve cash flow and strengthen its balance sheet and capital structure. The moves follow a massive shake-up in September, which included naming a new chief executive officer, discontinuing a new line of cosmetics for mature women and cutting jobs. Shares of Revlon, which also sells brands including Almay and Mitchum, were up 7 cents, or 4.6 percent, at $1.59 after climbing as high as $1.63 on the New York Stock Exchange. "Although these actions were expected, we still view this as a positive as it gives the company some breathing room under its covenants and gets the ball rolling in the company's quest to clean up its balance sheet," SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analyst Bill Chappell wrote in a note to clients. A $75 million equity offering had been planned for some time, then deferred as Revlon worked on revitalizing its brands. The company now expects to launch a $100 million rights offering that would allow holders to buy additional Class A common stock; it still plans to use proceeds to reduce debt. Revlon plans to distribute rights to buy shares to its shareholders at the close of business on December 11. Revlon said the subscription price would be determined by a committee of independent directors based on market conditions. MacAndrews & Forbes, Revlon's parent company owned by financier Perelman, agreed to buy its pro rata share of the $100 million of Class A common stock covered by the rights offering. MacAndrews & Forbes would also backstop $75 million of the offering, buying Class A shares offered but not purchased so that the gross proceeds of the rights offering would total $75 million. Meanwhile, Revlon's operating unit, Revlon Consumer Products Corp., expects to refinance and replace its existing $800 million term loan with a new five-year $840 million term loan facility. Revlon also expects to amend an existing $160 million multi-currency revolving credit facility and extend its maturity through the same five-year period. New York-based Revlon said that if the unit completed the refinancing, it would expect annual interest savings due to lower interest margins, which would give Revlon greater flexibility and extend the maturity dates of the unit's existing bank credit agreement. "We do expect the new term loan will have a slightly better rate, resulting in interest savings, but we will not adjust our estimates until the deal closes in the next few weeks," said Chappell, who has a "buy" rating on the company's shares. Citicorp Global Markets Inc. will be the sole lead arranger and sole bookrunner on the term loan and credit facilities and JPMorgan Chase Bank will act as syndication agent on the term loan facility, Revlon said.
