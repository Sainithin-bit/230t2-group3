 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - General Motors Corp. ( GM.N ) Chief Executive Rick Wagoner said on Wednesday he is "not excessively worried" about a possible proxy fight with the automaker's largest individual shareholder, billionaire Kirk Kerkorian. 

 "We're just running the business every day to do the right thing for the business and our shareholders and not excessively worried about the rest of that," Wagoner told reporters at the Greater Los Angeles Auto Show, referring to a possible proxy fight with Kerkorian. Kerkorian's associate, Jerry York, resigned from GM's board in October in a dispute over board oversight and strategy triggered by GM's decision not to pursue an alliance with Renault-Nissan ( RENA.PA ) ( 7201.T ). York's resignation -- and his public criticism of the oversight the board provided -- led many analysts to believe Kerkorian was gearing up for a proxy fight to seek control of the board and oust Wagoner. "If we continue to do what we did this year with a continuous turnaround on a remarkable pace and keep driving the growth in places like China and Russia, our profitability will come back, cash flow and stock price will react to that," Wagoner said.
