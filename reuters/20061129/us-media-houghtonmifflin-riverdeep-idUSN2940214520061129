 In 6th paragraph, corrects figure on deal in 2002 

 By  Megan Davies NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Riverdeep Inc., an Irish educational software publisher, is close to a deal to buy U.S. textbook publisher Houghton Mifflin for about $3.5 billion including debt, two sources familiar with the situation told Reuters on Wednesday. Boston-based Houghton Mifflin is owned by private equity firms Bain Capital, Thomas H. Lee Partners and The Blackstone Group. Bain and Thomas H. Lee each own 40 percent of Houghton Mifflin, while Blackstone owns the remaining 20 percent. The deal is expected to be structured so that a new holding company will be created combining both Houghton Mifflin and Riverdeep. A Houghton Mifflin spokesman declined to comment. Riverdeep was not immediately available for comment. Excluding debt, the deal is worth $1.7 billion, according to the Wall Street Journal. French media group Vivendi ( VIV.PA ) sold Houghton Mifflin to private equity groups in 2002 for $1.66 billion (1.7 billion euros). Founded in 1995, Riverdeep is behind popular educational software brands Reader Rabbit, Carmen Sandiego and Cluefinders. Its flagship product is Destination Success, which encompasses mathematics and reading courses for various ages. The deal would bring together players in both the traditional and interactive media industries, giving Houghton Mifflin some technological firepower as the industry shifts to electronic media.
