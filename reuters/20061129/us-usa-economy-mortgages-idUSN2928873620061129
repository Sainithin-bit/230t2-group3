 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Applications for U.S. home mortgages fell last week as housing market muddled along and the Thanksgiving holiday shortened the work week, an industry group said on Wednesday. 

 The seasonally adjusted index of total mortgage applications declined 3.9 percent in the week ended November 24 to 599, its lowest level since October, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. The four-week moving average for the applications index rose by 1.1 percent to 622.8. The MBA's measure of loan refinancing dropped 9.6 percent to 1,749.6, the group said. Its index of mortgage applications earmarked for home purchases rose for a third week in the past four, climbing 1.3 percent to 406.7. "We're about where we expect to be for the next couple of quarters," said Mike Fratantoni, senior director of research and economics at the MBA. "We are forecasting that home sales volumes will reach a low point at the end of the second quarter 2007" with the purchase index staying within the 370 to 400 range, he said. The shortened week made it difficult to discern any patterns despite seasonal adjustments, he said. Some economists say recent data showing mixed results from the housing market suggests the worst of the year's slump may have passed. The MBA's purchase index has rebounded since late October's 375.6, the lowest level in the current downturn. Sales of existing homes, which represent most of the market, unexpectedly rose in October to a 6.24 million-unit annual rate as prices fell, the National Association of Realtors said on Tuesday. The median home price declined 3.5 percent from October 2005, marking the largest year-on-year decline since the NAR began keeping records in 1968. However, new home sales slipped 3.2 percent in October even as their prices rose, a government report showed on Wednesday. "We still have some problems in the housing market" since new home sales were weaker than expected, said Gary Thayer, chief economist at A.G. Edwards & Sons in St. Louis. Long-term, 30-year fixed-rate mortgage rates last week were unchanged at 6.13 percent, the lowest level since January, the MBA said. Ten-year Treasury notes, which guide the mortgage rate, have fallen since then. Lower fixed rates relative to floating rates has reduced the attractiveness of adjustable-rate mortgages, which exploded in popularity in 2003 and 2004. The ARM share of applications last week fell 1 percentage point to 24.5 percent, the lowest level since October 2003.
