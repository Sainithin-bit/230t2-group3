  By  Frank Tang  and Atul Prakash NEW YORK/LONDON  Nov 29 (Reuters) - Gold eased on
Wednesday, as the dollar bounced back from recent lows after
stronger-than-expected figures on third-quarter U.S. economy
growth.  Some analysts and traders said they expected the precious
metals market to struggle to break out of its recent range
before the end of the the year.  "If the dollar continues to weaken then gold will go
higher, but it's going to be a grudging move higher rather than
anything explosive," said John Reade, head of metals strategy
at UBS Investment Bank.  "What would have to change, I guess, is that we have to see
investors suddenly have more risk appetite. And at the moment,
in the gold market specifically, they are not really showing
that," he said.  Spot gold XAU= was quoted at $636.10/637.10 an ounce by
16:15 EST (2115 GMT) after moving in a tight $3 range. It was
last quoted at $639.30/640.30 late on Tuesday.  The metal jumped to a three-month high of $641.75 on
Monday, mainly due to dollar weakness and firm crude oil
prices, but subsequently pared gains on profit-taking.  The dollar rebounded after the strong GDP data increased
the expectations that the Federal Reserve can hold off on
cutting interest rates. Higher rates make U.S. securities more
attractive and increase demand for the dollars.  The dollar hit a 20-month low against the euro this week,
while oil prices rose toward $62 a barrel after U.S. inventory
data showed unexpected declines in stocks of winter fuel, with
colder temperatures forecast in the world's top heating oil
market.  Gold often moves in the opposite direction to the dollar
and is generally seen as a hedge against inflation.  "Gold is really directionless at the moment, but everyone I
have spoken to is fairly bullish to it," one trader said. "It
is drifting a bit, but I think it is still looking fairly
strong."  That said, gold was finding it tough to break through the
$640 level. Some traders said the impetus may come from silver,
which has put in a very strong performance since early October
-- gaining some 30 percent in value.  Silver XAG= rose to its highest since mid-May at $13.77
an ounce and was last quoted at $13.53/$13.60, against
$13.67/13.74 on Tuesday.  Some traders said the silver market was now targeting
$14.50, but noted it was much smaller than the gold market and
so prone to sharp fluctuations.  Silver, which also benefits from its use in industrial
applications, hit its highest in 25 years in May when it
rallied to a peak of $15.17 as funds poured money into many
commodities.  Platinum XPT= fell to $1,150/1,160 an ounce from
$1,155/1,165 late Tuesday, while palladium XPD= dropped to
$317/322 an ounce from $320/325.
