 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Department store operator Bon-Ton Stores Inc. ( BONT.O ) on Wednesday reported a wider quarterly loss, hurt by an income tax charge, but reaffirmed its fiscal year earnings forecast. 

 "We are executing to our plan and we are on target to reach our financial goals for fiscal 2006. However, it is important that we continue to perform to plan during the critical fourth quarter," said Keith Plowman, Bon-Ton's chief financial officer, in a statement. Shares rose 14.5 percent to $36.95 in late morning trading. Bon-Ton, which in the first quarter acquired the Northern Department Store Group, or Carson's, from Saks Inc., reported a loss of $10.9 million, or 66 cents per share, for its fiscal third quarter ended October 28, compared with a loss of $6.3 million, or 39 cents per share, a year earlier. It said the quarter's results include an income tax charge of roughly 10 cents per share for a $1.7 million reduction in its income tax benefit due to new tax planning strategies. Analysts, on average, were expecting a loss of 45 cents per share, excluding the income tax charge, according to Reuters Estimates. Bon-Ton, which is working to integrate Carson's operations into its business, now operates 275 department stores and seven furniture galleries under nameplates including Bon-Ton, Bergner's, Carson Pirie Scott, Elder-Beerman, and Younkers. It said third-quarter sales jumped 181 percent to $804.1 million, including $537.5 million from the Carson's stores. Its gross margin rate increased 2.8 percentage points to 36.6 percent of net sales, helped by fewer markdowns. Bon-Ton's quarterly comparable-store sales, which do not include Carson's, decreased 4.8 percent, while its November sales at stores open at least a year fell 10.5 percent. Carson's November comparable-store sales rose 6.6 percent. For its fiscal year, Bon-Ton said it expects earnings per share of $2.15 to $2.25. Analysts are expecting $2.53 per share for the year, according to the average estimate of three analysts polled by Reuters Estimates.
