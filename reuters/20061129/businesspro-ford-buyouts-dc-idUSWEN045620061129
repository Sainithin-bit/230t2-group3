 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co. ( F.N ) on Wednesday said 
a total of 38,000 employees -- almost half of the automaker's 
U.S. factory workforce -- had accepted buyout offers to leave 
the company. 

  The number includes about 30,000 workers who the most 
recent round of buyout offers that concluded this week and 
about 8,000 employees who accepted Ford's earlier 
plant-by-plant buyout offers.  The buyouts exceed Ford's goal of cutting 30,000 
blue-collar jobs in North America by 2008 and exceeds rival 
General Motors Corp.'s ( GM.N ) similar efforts earlier this 
year, which resulted in 34,400 workers accepting buyout offers.  Ford in September said it would reduce its North American 
hourly workforce by 25,000 to 30,000 employees by the end of 
2008.  The No. 2 U.S. automaker is in the midst of cutting jobs 
and shutting 16 factories in an attempt to return its North 
American automotive operations to profitability by 2009.  Ford has reported a loss of nearly $7 billion in the first 
nine months of this year.  During the most recent round offers, Ford offered buyouts 
to all of its nearly 75,000 U.S. factory workers from October 
16 to November 27.  Hourly employees who accepted the buyouts during that time 
will begin to leave the company in January 2007 and the process 
is expected to be completed by September 2007.  Of the 38,000 total acceptances, about 6,000 were by hourly 
employees at Automotive Component Holdings, a holding company 
that comprises of former Visteon Corp. ( VC.N ) factories.  The company said the numbers are preliminary as all buyout 
offers are voluntary and include an opportunity for workers to 
rescind acceptance up until the time they leave the company.  Ford shares were up 2.21 percent at $8.33 in morning 
trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
