 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - The dangers of inflation may not yet be over for the United States, despite recent data indicating that price rises have slowed, St Louis Federal Reserve Bank President William Poole said in an interview published on Wednesday. 

 Poole told Germany's Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper that the weakening in inflation seen in recent weeks did not mean "that we have already crossed over the mountain." It is still possible that some companies will try to pass higher costs onto consumers, he said in the interview. "But markets are quite obviously convinced that inflation will now slow quickly," Poole said in light of futures markets expectations for easier monetary policy in the coming months. The Fed will announce its next interest rate decision on December 12.
