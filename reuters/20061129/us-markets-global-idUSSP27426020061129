 LONDON  (Reuters) - European stocks bounced on Wednesday, snapping a five-day losing streak as signs of strength in Japan's economy lifted Asian bourses and the yen, while forecasts for cold U.S. weather pushed oil above $61. 

 Government bonds were little moved after markets absorbed fresh U.S. and German supply, with Tuesday's weak U.S. durable goods data offset by hawkish comments on inflation from U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke. By 1030 GMT, the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 Index  .FTEU3  had risen 0.7 percent to 1,435.4 points, having fallen as much as 3.8 percent since hitting a 5-1/2 peak last week. The index has gained almost 13 percent this year and although markets expect the global economy to slow next year, companies continue to make very good returns, said Kevin Gardiner, a global strategist at HSBC. "The spread between the cost of capital and the profitability of firms is at record levels and is going to stay close to those levels next year," he said, adding that valuations remained low and markets should drift higher. Gains were broad-based, but exporters and stocks geared to the economic cycle were among the best performers having suffered most during the recent sell-off. Europe's largest car maker, Volkswagen ( VOWG.DE ), rose 4 percent on renewed talk of bid interest from rival Porsche ( PSHG_p.DE ). Porsche denied it was planning a bid. Pharmaceutical companies .SXDP such as GlaxoSmithKline ( GSK.L ) outperformed after global leader Pfizer ( PFE.N ) on Tuesday announced plans to cut its U.S. sales force by 20 percent. Heavyweight energy stocks .SXEP rose as expectations for colder weather in the U.S. Northeast, a key heating oil market, supported crude prices. U.S. light crude CLc1 rose to $61.39 a barrel, a one-month high. DATA BOOSTS YEN, NIKKEI In Asia, data showing Japanese industrial output rose 1.6 percent in October surprised markets which were expecting a decline of 0.5 percent. The data lifted the battered yen and Tokyo stocks, offering evidence that the cooling U.S. economy will be offset by improving growth in other regions. The yen recovered from a fresh record low at 153.45 per euro EURJPY= to trade around 153 yen. The dollar was little moved at 116.23 yen  JPY= , while the euro briefly hit a fresh 20-month high versus the dollar at $1.3218 before falling into negative territory. The Nikkei average  .N225  rallied 1.4 percent to end at 16,076.2 points, its first close above the 16,000 point level in a week. "Japan's industrial output data is proving its economy is on track for stronger growth, so the implications for the global economy are positive," said Jason Hwang, a strategist at Woori Investment and Securities in South Korea. Factory output in South Korea rose unexpectedly in October according to data on Wednesday, strengthening the prospects of a rate rise in Asia's third-largest economy early next year. BONDS MIXED The stronger data dented Asian government bonds, but European paper was mixed as markets reacted to the weaker U.S. data on Tuesday, Bernanke's comments overnight on the upside risks to inflation and the well-received sale of 4 billion euros in five-year German debt. The December Bund future FGBLZ6 was down 11 ticks at 118.33, retreating from Tuesday's one-month peak, while the yield on 10-year notes EU10YT=RR edged up to 3.703 percent.
