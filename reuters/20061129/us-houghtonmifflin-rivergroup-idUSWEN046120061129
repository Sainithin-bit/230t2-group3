 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Textbook publisher Houghton Mifflin will be acquired by Riverdeep, an Irish educational software publisher, for $1.75 billion, the companies said on Wednesday. 

 The deal gives Houghton Mifflin technological firepower as the education publishing industry shifts to electronic media. Riverdeep's popular educational software brands include Reader Rabbit, Carmen Sandiego and Cluefinders. Riverdeep will assume $1.61 billion of Houghton Mifflin debt, giving the deal a total value of $3.4 billion. Certain Houghton Mifflin managers and employees will roll over $40 million of their equity into equity of HM Rivergroup, a newly formed company that will own both Riverdeep and Houghton Mifflin. Boston-based Houghton Mifflin is owned by private equity firms Bain Capital, Thomas H. Lee Partners and Blackstone Group BG.UL. Bain and Thomas H. Lee each own 40 percent of the company, while Blackstone owns 20 percent. French media group Vivendi ( VIV.PA ) sold Houghton Mifflin to the private equity groups in 2002 for $1.66 billion (1.7 billion euros). Riverdeep's Barry O'Callaghan will become executive chairman of HM Rivergroup, while Tony Lucki, chairman, president and chief executive of Houghton Mifflin, will become vice chairman. Dublin-based HM Rivergroup expects to complete the deal before year-end. After closing, HM Rivergroup will change its name to Houghton Mifflin Riverdeep Group Plc. Houghton Mifflin and Riverdeep had combined revenue of $1.425 billion in the 12 months ended September 30. Riverdeep's flagship product is Destination Success, which encompasses mathematics and reading courses for various ages. (Additional reporting by  Robert MacMillan  and  Michael Flaherty )
