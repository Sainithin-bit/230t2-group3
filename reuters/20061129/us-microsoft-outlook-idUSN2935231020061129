 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp.( MSFT.O ) Chief Financial Officer Chris Liddell on Wednesday said the world's largest software company still expected revenue to grow 13 percent to 15 percent for the current fiscal year. 

 Liddell, in comments at a CSFB technology conference, also said that he saw no reason the world's largest software maker would not continue aggressive stock buybacks. In slides accompanying the presentation, Liddell also forecast fiscal 2007 operating earnings growth of 9 percent to 11 percent and earnings per share growth of 13 percent to 15 percent. Shares of Microsoft rose nearly 1 percent, or 28 cents, to $29.67 in morning Nasdaq trade.
