 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Chemicals maker DuPont Co. ( DD.N ) said on Wednesday it expects its 2007 earnings per share to be about $3.15, in line with its prior forecasts for 10 percent annual increases. 

 The company, which makes products ranging from Teflon to Kevlar, said at its investor conference in New York that it continues to target $400 million in cost savings for 2007, partly from streamlining projects. Hassan Ahmed, an analyst with HSBC said: "They (DuPont) are being very conservative with guidance, very similar to what they did in 2006." DuPont continues to expect 2006 reported earnings of about $2.86 a share, including the net benefit of 1 cent a share from year-to-date significant items. In November 2005 the company announced that it would reduce fixed costs by $1 billion over a three-year period. The bulk of the cost reductions will take place through 2007 and 2008. DuPont has already begun to see earnings growth being spurred by the cost reduction measures announced a year ago. Analysts are also confident about DuPont's near-term outlook due to a rich pipeline of products, which present strong revenue growth prospects for the company over the next few years. Don Carson, an analyst with Merrill Lynch, said in a research note that "The top-line growth from DuPont's rejuvenated R&D effort is finally being leveraged with significant productivity improvements." Carson also said it is likely that the company would announce an additional share repurchase, once the current buyback program ends in 2007. DuPont had announced a $5 billion share repurchase program last year and it has thus far bought back $3.3 billion worth of shares. Shares of DuPont have risen about 20 percent over the last 3 months, outperforming the Standard and Poor's Chemicals index .GSPPM, which is up only about 8.5 percent over the same period. The Wilmington, Delaware, company said it expects revenues from Brazil, Russia, India and China to grow more than 20 percent in 2006 Chad Holliday, chairman and chief executive officer of DuPont, speaking on the sidelines of the investor conference said: "Large acquisitions don't seem to be on the horizon because they are dilutive." Holliday also added that he did not see any major divestitures in the near future. Shares of DuPont, a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, fell 20 cents to $48.00 in late afternoon trade on the New York Stock Exchange. (Additional reporting by  Matt Daily )
