 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The Obama administration will set a strict deadline for General Motors Corp and Chrysler LLC to reach cost-cutting deals with creditors and their major union even as it extends more aid to the struggling automakers, the New York Times reported on Friday. 

 The newspaper, which quoted people with knowledge of the discussions, said the White House was likely to extend more short-term aid to GM and Chrysler while also saying that bankruptcy was still a potential outcome for either. The White House said on Friday that President Barack Obama would announce a further aid package for GM and Chrysler on Monday, a day before a deadline under the federal bailout that has kept both automakers in operation. The New York Times reported that the White House autos task force was likely to set a deadline of weeks rather than months for GM and Chrysler to reach a deal with creditors and the United Auto Workers. Under the terms of the $17.4 billion in emergency loans approved for the Detroit automakers by the Bush administration in late December, GM and Chrysler need to win concessionary agreements to reduce the amount owed to the United Auto Workers and other creditors. GM and Chrysler have reached agreements in principle to change provisions of their contract with the UAW that would reduce the average hourly cost for production workers, another provision of the loan deal. But neither automaker has struck a deal with the union on how to restructure the amount they owe to a trust fund affiliated with the union that will take over responsibility for paying for retiree health care after 2010. GM, which has $27 billion in outstanding bonds, also faces a target of reducing that debt by two thirds by getting debt holders to agree to accept newly issued stock instead.
