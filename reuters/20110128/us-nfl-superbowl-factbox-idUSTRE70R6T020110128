 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Facts and figures about Super Bowl XLV, to be played between the Pittsburgh Steelers and Green Bay Packers at Dallas on February 6. 

 FAVORITE SPORT * Professional football (31 per cent) remains the favorite game among Americans who follow at least one sport, topping baseball (17 per cent), according to a Harris Interactive poll. College football (12 per cent), auto racing (7 per cent) and men's pro basketball (6 per cent) round out the top five. ECONOMIC IMPACT * Spending in the United States on Super Bowl-related merchandise, apparel and snacks is expected to reach $10.1 billion, or an average of $59.33 per consumer, up from $8.9 billion, or $52.63 per consumer, last year, according to a survey by the Retail Advertising and Marketing Association. * Super Bowl XLV is forecast to have a $612 million economic impact in the Dallas region, according to a study commissioned by the North Texas Super Bowl XLV Host Committee. That would be an all-time record, topping the $500 million reported for Super Bowl XLII in Arizona, the committee said. * According to the study, 147,000 out-of-state visitors and 4,600 media are expected during Super Bowl week, 24,000 hotel rooms are booked in 12 cities across north Texas and 600 private jet trips to north Texas are anticipated. * The matchup between the Pittsburgh Steelers and Green Bay Packers is a good sign as U.S. market returns top 20 per cent annually when either team plays, according to a tongue-in-cheek analysis by Capital IQ, a unit of Standard & Poor's. TV/ADVERTISING * Last year's Super Bowl victory by the New Orleans Saints over the Indianapolis Colts on CBS drew a record U.S. TV viewing audience of 106.5 million, topping the 106 million who watched the finale of the comedy M*A*S*H in 1983. * Last year, CBS said its advertising revenue in the first quarter, which included the Super Bowl, rose 17 per cent. Without the NFL championship, the increase would have been high single digits. CEO Leslie Moonves said last March that CBS took in $200 million in revenue on game day. * News Corp's Fox is charging advertisers, including Anheuser-Busch InBev, PepsiCo, Walt Disney and General Motors Co, an estimated $2.8 million to $3 million for 30-second spots in this year's Super Bowl. * From 2001 through 2010, the Super Bowl has accounted for over seven hours of commercial time, representing more than 850 announcements and $1.62 billion of network advertising sales, according to Kantar Media. * The 2010 Super Bowl contained a record 47 minutes and 50 seconds of network ads in an all-time high 104 messages. * Nielsen found last year that 51 per cent of those polled tuned in more to watch the commercials than the Super Bowl. FOOD/ENTERTAINMENT * Dips and spreads are top choice at 30 per cent for food to eat during the Super Bowl, according to a poll commissioned by grocer Supervalu. That was followed by chicken wings (22 per cent), pizza (17 per cent), chips and salty snacks (14 per cent), and burgers, hot dogs and brats (9 per cent). * Football fans are expected to eat an estimated 69.6 million pounds (31,570 tones) of avocados during the Super Bowl, according to the Hass Avocado Board, which represents 20,000 producers and 100 importers. That's enough to cover Cowboys Stadium field, in almost 27 feet of avocados. * Strip club operator Rick's Cabaret expects to see at least $1 million in extra sales at its seven Dallas-area clubs from the Super Bowl next month. TICKETS * Face value for Super Bowl tickets range from $200 for the plaza outside the Arlington, Texas, stadium to $1,200 for club seats inside, the NFL said. That's a far cry from the $6 tickets one could buy for the first Super Bowl in 1967. * The face value of a ticket for the Super Bowl since 1967 has outpaced inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index -8,900 per cent to less than 600 per cent, according to broker-dealer ConvergEx. * On the secondary market, ticket prices have soared, hitting an average of $4,375 on January 26, up 67 per cent from the same point last year, FanSnap said. * NFL formula for dividing the game's tickets: 17.5 per cent to each participating team, 5 percent to the host team, 34.8 percent for the other clubs and 25.2 per cent to the league. TRIVIA * According to Populous, the NFL's consulting architect for the Super Bowl, 200,000 square feet (18,580 square meters) of tents will be erected around the stadium, as well as 8 miles of fencing, 3,000 feet of concrete barricades and 26 temporary broadcast booths. In addition, 260 port-a-potties will be set up and 8,000 linear feet of duct tape will be used for the media route. * The Vince Lombardi Trophy presented to the Super Bowl's winning team is made by high-end jeweler Tiffany & Co and stands almost 21 inches tall and weighs 107 ounces (3 kilograms), the NFL said. It is worth more than $25,000. (Editing by  Steve Ginsburg )
