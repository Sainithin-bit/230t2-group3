 (Reuters) - Bank of America Corp may give some investment bankers a greater share of their bonus payments in cash for 2010 compared to the previous year, the Wall Street Journal said, citing people familiar with the situation. 

 Bankers and traders making more than $5 million may be paid as much as 30 percent of their 2010 compensation in cash and at least 70 percent in deferred stock, the Journal said. A few Bank of America employees could see a stock award of as much as 80 percent and 20 percent in cash, the paper said. "We feel that our pay practices are fair and appropriate for our employees and our shareholders," a BofA spokesman told the paper. The bank did not immediately return Reuters calls seeking comment.
