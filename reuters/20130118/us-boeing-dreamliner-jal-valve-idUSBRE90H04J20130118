 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japan's transportation ministry said a fuel leak on a Japan Airlines-operated Boeing 787 jet last week was due to a malfunction in a driving mechanism that controls a valve. 
 The British company that makes the valve for the jet was investigating the matter, the ministry said. (Reporting by  James Topham ; Editing by Edmund Klamann)
