 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Morgan Stanley said its commodity results fell in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, and trading risks for the sector were also lower. 
 "Commodities results declined meaningfully in a challenging market," the bank said. Morgan Stanley's Value-at-Risk (VaR) in commodities stood at $22 million in the fourth quarter, unchanged from the previous three months but down from $26 million in the 2011 fourth quarter.
