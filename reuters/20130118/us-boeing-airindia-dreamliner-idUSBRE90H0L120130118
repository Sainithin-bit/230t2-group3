 NEW DELHI  (Reuters) - Boeing Co. is liable to compensate state-run Air India for the grounding of 787 Dreamliner passenger jets on safety issues, Indian aviation minister Ajit Singh told reporters on Friday. 
 The lightweight, mainly carbon-composite aircraft has been plagued by mishaps, raising concerns over its use of lithium-ion batteries and forcing many airlines across the globe to ground them. Poland's state-controlled LOT Airlines earlier said it would seek compensation from Boeing for grounding its two planes. (Reporting by  Anurag Kotoky ; Editing by Prateek Chatterjee)
