 BERLIN  (Reuters) - Germany does not expect the troika of foreign lenders that is currently in Athens to deliver a report on Greece's progress before a summit of European Union leaders on Monday, a senior German official said on Thursday. 
 "I would not expect the report of the troika to be ready by the summit on Monday," the official said, requesting anonymity, at a pre-summit media briefing. He added that this meant that Greece would not play a major role at the EU leaders summit. (Reporting by  Noah Barkin )
