 LONDON  (Reuters) - Prudential ( PRU.L ), Britain's largest insurer, is in advanced talks to buy the Asian operations of bailed-out insurance giant AIG ( AIG.N ), sources familiar with the discussions told Reuters on Saturday. 

 Financing for the deal -- which could be worth more than $20 billion and would propel Prudential to the top spot among insurers in Asia -- could include a bumper share issue, the sources said. Prudential declined to comment. A year ago sources familiar with the matter said that Prudential had made a preliminary offer for AIA, but its modest price fell short of the seller's expectations. At the time, AIG had wanted between $20 billion and $40 billion for AIA, depending on the size of the stake to be sold. (Reporting by  Clara Ferreira-Marques , Editing by Kylie MacLellan)
