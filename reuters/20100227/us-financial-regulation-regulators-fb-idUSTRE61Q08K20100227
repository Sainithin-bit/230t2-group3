 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - A reordering of the federal agencies that oversee the financial system is likely to result from the continuing push for regulatory reform by the Obama administration and Democrats in Congress. 

 Here are the major regulators involved and their duties. * TREASURY DEPARTMENT Treasury is a cabinet-level department tasked primarily with financing the government and collecting taxes. It plays a major role in bond markets. It regulates banks mainly through two units: the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS). * OFFICE OF THE COMPTROLLER OF THE CURRENCY OCC charters, regulates and supervises national banks, including some of the nation's largest. Formed in 1863, it has about 3,000 employees and is led by Comptroller John Dugan. * OFFICE OF THRIFT SUPERVISION OTS regulates thrift institutions. Formed after the 1980s-1990s savings and loan crisis, OTS has about 1,000 employees. Officials and key lawmakers seem determined to eliminate the OTS, which was the primary regulator for failed lenders like Countrywide Financial and Washington Mutual. * FEDERAL RESERVE The Fed is an independent agency that controls the nation's monetary policy, while also supervising state-chartered banks that opt into the Fed system. Created in 1913, it has about 2,700 employees involved in supervision and regulation. The Fed under Chairman Ben Bernanke has radically expanded its role in the economy, injecting hundreds of billions of dollars of liquidity into the financial system. * FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORP The FDIC is an independent agency that protects consumers by insuring deposits in banks and thrifts. It also examines state-chartered banks that do not join the Fed system, and is funded through fees that banks pay for deposit insurance. Created in 1933 during the Great Depression, the agency has about 5,000 employees. It is chaired by Sheila Bair. * SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION The SEC regulates public corporations, stock exchanges, brokers, mutual funds, municipal bonds and corporate auditors. Formed in 1934, it has about 3,500 employees and is led by Chairman Mary Schapiro. * COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING COMMISSION The CFTC oversees commodity and financial futures. With about 490 employees, it was formed in 1974. Gary Gensler is its chairman.
