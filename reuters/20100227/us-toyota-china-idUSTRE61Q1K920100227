 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp's ( 7203.T ) president will hold a news conference in Beijing on Monday to explain its recent recalls, Kyodo news agency reported, citing an announcement by the automaker's local unit. 

 No one at Toyota in Japan could be reached for comment. The briefing by Akio Toyoda in China would follow his appearance this week in Washington, where he was grilled by U.S. lawmakers for a series of recalls that have tarnished the carmaker's brand and reputation for quality. Toyota has recalled more than 8 million cars globally for unintended acceleration and braking problems, in a widening safety crisis that broke about one month ago. The bulk of the recalls are in the United States. Toyota said last month that it had submitted an application to recall more than 75,000 of the RAV4 sport utility vehicle in China, the world's largest auto market in 2009. The cars were made at Toyota's joint venture plant with China's FAW in Tianjin. (Editing by Ron Askew)
