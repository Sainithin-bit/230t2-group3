 SANTIAGO  (Reuters) - Chile, the world's biggest copper producer, was rocked by a huge magnitude-8.8 earthquake on Saturday, putting at risk operations at several of the country's mid-sized mines near the capital and oil refineries, but sparing the massive deposits in the north. 

 The quake affected the 116,000 barrel pre day (bpd) Bio Bio oil refinery run by state energy firm ENAP, the country's largest, said Mining Minister Santiago Gonzalez. Bio Bio is located just north of the city of Concepcion, near the epicenter. ENAP said the quake had also affected its roughly 100,000 bpd Aconcagua refinery near the capital, and that it would need to increase diesel imports to meet demand. It said it had sufficient gasoline stocks to last two weeks and diesel stocks for 10 days. The U.S. Geological Survey said the earthquake struck 56 miles northeast of Concepcion -- which is south of Santiago -- at a depth of 22 miles at 3:34 a.m. (0634 GMT). As of 1800 GMT, operations at mines producing over 1 million metric tones a year -- near one-fifth of the country's total 5.4 million metric tones last year -- had been suspended by the quake, but they appeared undamaged. State-run Codelco said all of its operations were unaffected except for its El Teniente and Andina mines, which were suspended because of electricity cuts after the quake but were otherwise undamaged. Garcia it could take two days for the mines to resume production. Freeport McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc ( FCX.N ) said the quake did not damage its two mines in the country, but it is facing a power outage at its Candelaria mine, which will result in a temporary shutdown. Smaller miners reported little impact. Barrick Gold Corp ( ABX.TO ) and Breakwater BWR.TO said its mines had not been affected. Teck Resources Ltd ( TCKb.TO ) said the quake had not impacted its Andacollo and Quebrada mines, though they could still be hit by power supply restrictions.
