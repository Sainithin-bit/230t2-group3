 LONDON  (Reuters) - Prudential ( PRU.L ), Britain's largest insurer, is in talks to buy the Asian operations of bailed-out insurance giant AIG ( AIG.N ) in what would be one of the largest ever overseas deals by a UK firm, Sky News reported. 

 Sky said Pru Chief Executive Tidjane Thiam was putting a proposal to AIG's board in New York on Saturday. Sky added financing for the deal, which could be worth about $25 billion, could include a 15 billion pound ($22.8 billion) share issue. Prudential declined to comment.
