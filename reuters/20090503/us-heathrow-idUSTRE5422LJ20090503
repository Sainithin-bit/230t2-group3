 LONDON  (Reuters) - The leaders of some of the UK's largest companies have started a revolt against the third runway at Heathrow, citing "responsible citizenship," media reports said. 

 An open letter, signed by 13 business leaders, is expected to question the benefits to business of the runway and to call for more exploration into possible alternatives, the Daily Telegraph reported on Monday. Among the names listed were James Murdoch, head of News Corporation in Europe and Asia, and BSkyB ( BSY.L ) chief Jeremy Darroch, the paper said. "To say that all those from the business community support the third runway is wrong," the letter is expected to say on Monday, according to the Daily Telegraph report. The letter is expected to take issue with the notion that passengers changing planes at Heathrow boost the domestic economy. The company leaders will call for more new high-speed rail links, and raise environmental and safety concerns, the paper said. The Sunday Times had earlier reported that the 13 also included Justin King of J Sainsbury ( SBRY.L ), Charles Dunstone of Carphone Warehouse ( CPW.L ), Ian Cheshire of Kingfisher ( KGF.L ) and Roy Gardner of Compass ( CPG.L ). Kingfisher confirmed Cheshire was involved, but the others were unavailable for comment. The paper cited Russell Chambers, an adviser at Credit Suisse, who it said was "instrumental informing the group." "It's possible to be pro-transport, pro-aviation and yet at the same time, pro-responsible citizenship," he told the paper. A source familiar with Chambers' thinking confirmed to Reuters that he has been very concerned about the third runway along with a number of other "high profile" executives. Credit Suisse declined to comment. (Reporting by  Ben Deighton  and  Avril Ormsby ; editing by  Richard Chang )
