 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc. ( PFE.N ) said on Tuesday that it had won a patent case over its Lipitor drug in an Irish court, which ruled a patent protecting the blockbuster cholesterol fighter would be infringed by a competing product from India's Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd. ( RANB.BO ) 

 The decision by the High Court in Dublin prevents Ranbaxy from launching its drug before the basic Lipitor patent expires in November 2011, Pfizer said. The ruling is subject to a possible appeal. Lipitor is the world's top-selling drug and amounted to more than one-fourth of Pfizer's $48 billion in revenue last year. The company has been defending its intellectual property for the drug around the world against generic drugmaker Ranbaxy. Pfizer, the world's largest drugmaker, also is trying to protect Lipitor's market share against an influx of inexpensive generic versions of other cholesterol medicines. Pfizer shares closed at $25.88 on Monday on the New York Stock Exchange.
