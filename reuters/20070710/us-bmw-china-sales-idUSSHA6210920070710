 SHANGHAI  (Reuters) - BMW ( BMWG.DE ), the world's largest premium car maker, said on Tuesday it sold 38 percent more cars in mainland China in the first half of 2007, as the country's growing ranks of nouveau riche snapped up the latest models. 

 Total sales swelled to 23,667 units from 17,168 units a year earlier, it said in a statement. Sales of BMW brands rose 36 percent to 22,891 units, with Minis up 131 percent at 776 units. In the Greater China area, including Macau, Taiwan and Hong Kong, BMW moved 28,327 vehicles in the period, up 31 percent, it added. Many other foreign automakers have also reported strong first-half sales in the world's second-largest auto market, as they rolled out new models. Toyota Motor ( 7203.T ), a relative latecomer to China, sold 212,000 vehicles in the period, up 77 percent from a year earlier, powered by brisk demand for its Camry sedans, the best-selling car in the United States in eight of the past nine years. Sales of its premium model, Lexus, came to 12,000 units in the first six months, nearly matching the 13,000 models sold in all of 2006 and well on track to meet its full-year 2007 target of 22,000. BMW has teamed up with Brilliance China Automotive Holdings Ltd. ( 1114.HK )( CBA.N ) to make BMW 3 Series and 5 Series in a venture in the northern city of Shenyang, with an annual capacity of 30,000 units. Local media have said the venture, operating at full capacity, is building a second plant capable of making 20,000 cars per year. A BMW spokesman in China said late last month details of the expansion plans had yet to be finalized.
