 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Alcoa Inc. ( AA.N ), which has launched a hostile offer for Canadian rival Alcan Inc. AL.TO ( AL.N ), said on Tuesday that it signed for a $30 billion credit facility with its lenders that it would use to pay for Alcan shares. 

 The banks includes Citigroup Inc. ( C.N ) and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. ( GS.N ) as joint lead arrangers and joint book-running managers. The maturity date for the credit facility is January 10, 2009. The move is yet another step in Alcoa's attempt to take over Alcan. In addition, the company has filed with some antitrust authorities and on Monday, it extended the expiration time of its offer until August 10 from July 10. Alcan has rejected the $28.6 billion offer and its shares are trading above the offer price, indicating investors anticipate a higher offer from either Alcoa or a rival. Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and BMO Capital Markets are advising Alcoa on its offer, which was announced on May 7.
