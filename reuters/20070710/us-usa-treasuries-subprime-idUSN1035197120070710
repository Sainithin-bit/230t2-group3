 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The latest rumblings from the U.S. mortgage debacle is seen turning bond bears timid in the coming weeks or at least until the extent of contamination from subprime assets is clear. 

 Credit ratings agency Standard & Poor's stunned markets on Tuesday by warning of possible downgrades to a slew of mortgage-backed debt, boosting Treasuries but sending shivers through the riskier sectors of the fixed-income market. Even though the economy has bounced back from earlier scares in the subprime sector, which targets borrowers of lower credit quality, this latest bout of jitters should still tamp down yields until the scope of the damage is known. "It could keep rates artificially low for the next four to six weeks," said Ajay Rajadhyaksha, co-head of U.S. fixed income strategy at Barclays Capital in New York. If it weren't for housing and its credit implications, rebounding economic growth and nagging inflation concerns would be applying downward pressure on bond prices. This was the case last week, when the Treasury market suffered its biggest losses in over a year, based on the rise in benchmark 10-year yields US10YT=RR. By Tuesday afternoon, however, a powerful bond market rally pushed benchmark 10-year yields down to 5.03 percent, well off Friday's two-week highs near 5.20 percent. FIRST STEP? Worries that S&P's announcement could be the first step in a wave of downgrades that could affect investment-grade assets drove the rally in Treasuries. In particular, analysts say typically conservative classes of investors -- such as banks, insurance companies and money managers -- may be holding positions in assets destined for downgrades, including collateralized debt obligations. CDOs are a rapidly growing class of securities created by packaging together bonds, including risky subprime loans, junk or high-yield bonds and high-grade debt. Securities backed by subprime loans are often carved into pieces of varying degrees of risk, some including triple-A tranches made up of the most secure income stream in a CDO. Uncertainty over such a scenario led investors to dump some risky assets in favor of Treasuries, the market's usual safe haven in times of trouble. "People are worried about CDOs they cannot sell because when you want to sell things like this nobody wants to buy from you," said Michael Cheah, vice president, portfolio manager, at AIG SunAmerica Asset Management in Jersey City, New Jersey. "So these people are forced to sell junk bonds and corporate bonds, or pay in the swap market," he added. The fear now is that a large amount of assets have been masquerading as investment-grade. Ultimately they may have to be dumped, or offset by selling of other risky investments. "We have less than 10 companies that are triple-A rated," said Cheah. "Triple-A companies include GE ( GE.N ), Berkshire Hathaway ( BRKa.N ) and are we to believe that these CDO tranches made up of garbage are the equivalent of GE and Berkshire Hathaway?" "It's a joke. It's a fake. A lot of people are now just waking up to reality that these are fake triple-As -- while a few still need the rating agencies to tell them when to sell," he said. Still, some doubt subprime alone will bring an extended bond rally. Given that long-term rates are well below the 5.25 percent fed funds rate, it will take a solid conviction that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates to get the market going. "Other than a flight-to-quality bid, Treasuries definitely have a limit to how far they can run," said David Coard, head of fixed-income sales and trading at the Williams Capital Group in New York. "The 10-year yield probably won't go below 5 percent."
