 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Kicking off the new earnings season, aluminum company Alcoa Inc ( AA.N ) reported on Monday that second-quarter profit slipped, but still matched Wall Street expectations, even though revenue fell short of forecasts. 

 Alcoa also extended its $28.6 billion offer to acquire Canadian rival Alcan Inc AL.TO( AL.N ), which was to expire on Tuesday, by a month. Last week, Alcan said the offer remains inadequate and said it is pursuing alternatives, such as talks with other groups. It declined to comment on reports that Rio Tinto Ltd ( RIO.AX ) ( RIO.L ), the world's second-largest miner, has asked investment banks to advise it on options, including a possible counter bid for Alcan. Pittsburgh-based Alcoa, traditionally the first major corporation to report in the quarter, said earnings from continuing operations were $716 million, or 81 cents per share, compared with $749 million, or 85 cents per share, in the same quarter of last year. Revenue rose to $8.1 billion from $7.8 billion. The earnings matched Wall Street estimates, but the revenue figure fell below the analysts' average consensus of $8.41 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. Alcoa shares, which had risen 1.68 percent during the day on the New York Stock Exchange, fell 0.9 percent to $42 in extended trading after the announcement. In its news release, Alcoa also said it was extending its offer for Alcan until August 10, with all other terms and conditions of the offer remaining unchanged. "This extension period will provide Alcan's shareholders with more time to consider our offer while we continue to pursue the various governmental and regulatory approvals necessary to complete the offer," said Alcoa chief executive Alain Belda. Asked during a conference call with Wall Street analysts when he expected U.S., Canadian, Australian and European regulators to complete the reviews, he said there was no time frame. Alcoa said last week it received a request from the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice for additional information on the offer for Alcan. It said about 418,500 Alcan common shares had been deposited and not withdrawn under Alcoa's offer to date. "We remain the natural partner for Alcan with the most substantial synergies and an unparalleled commitment to Canada and Quebec," Belda said. Noting that Alcoa recorded record revenue for the second quarter, Belda said the outlook for aluminum was robust, especially in the aerospace, transportation and construction segments. Meanwhile, China is still driving demand. Alcoa estimates Chinese aluminum consumption growth of 34 percent, year-over-year, with North American growth declining about 2.5 percent. Overall, the company sees 10 percent world consumption growth in 2007, he told the analyst call. Included in Alcoa's quarterly results was a favorable after-tax restructuring adjustment of $21 million, or 2 cents per share from completion of its soft alloy extrusion joint venture with Sapa. That was offset by a 2 cent per share charge in transaction costs stemming from the Alcan offer. The company also reported $36 million, or 4 cents per share, of curtailment costs at Alcoa's Tennessee and Rockdale, Texas smelters. "It looks like it was a good quarter. It was less than last year, but the metal price was lower than last year," said analyst Charles Bradford of Bradford Research/Soleil. Andrew Seibert, co-portfolio manager at Stewart Capital Management in Pittsburgh, said the results were "fairly solid ... since expectations have been somewhat low. "I would think the shares are going to continue to rise on two things, not necessarily due to earnings," he said. "One is the possible buyout of Alcan and the second is that somebody may be buying Alcoa. That is what is pushing this stock up."
