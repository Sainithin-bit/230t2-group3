 CAMBRIDGE, Massachusetts  (Reuters) - Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke on Tuesday said he is hopeful to move forward in the "reasonably near future" with ideas on improving communications policies as the central bank. 

 "We are moving in a very collegial and intellectual way in coming up with new proposals," Bernanke said in answering questions after speaking before the National Bureau of Economic Research. The Fed chief also said interest paid on reserves might serve as an additional instrument of monetary policy control.
