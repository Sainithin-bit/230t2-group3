 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - A Google Inc. ( GOOG.O ) executive said on Tuesday that the company had heard the chairman of the U.S. Federal Communications Commission will propose the winner of a coming auction of valuable wireless airwaves be required to provide an "open platform" to consumers and rivals. 

 In a notice posted on Google's public policy blog, the company's Washington telecom and media counsel, Richard Whitt, said: "We're hearing through the proverbial grapevine" that open-platform requirements will be part of the auction rules that FCC Chairman Kevin Martin is expected to propose soon.
