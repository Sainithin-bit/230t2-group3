 MOSCOW  (Reuters) - A Moscow court on Tuesday delayed a hearing into a $22.5 billion lawsuit by Russia's federal customs service against Bank of New York to November after the plaintiffs asked the Foreign Ministry to intervene. 

 A lawyer for the plaintiffs said the customs service was now suing Bank of New York instead of Bank of New York Mellon Corp. ( BK.N ) after being informed that the Moscow office was a subsidiary of the first entity. "We have also been told that the Moscow office has no right to represent Bank of New York in the courts, and we have therefore asked Russia's Foreign Ministry to intervene and deliver all the necessary documents to BONY's head office," lawyer Maxim Smal told Reuters. A new hearing was set for November 13. Bank of New York Co. has completed an $18.3 billion merger with Pittsburgh-based Mellon Financial Corp. to create Bank of New York Mellon, the world's largest custodian of investor assets. The bank was not immediately available for comment. Russia filed the lawsuit in May, accusing the former Bank of New York Co. of helping illegally transfer $7 billion through its accounts in the late 1990s. The lawsuit was filed 18 months after the bank agreed to pay $38 million to settle two U.S. criminal investigations, including one into the alleged money-laundering conspiracy. A former Bank of New York executive and her husband pleaded guilty in 2000 to being part of a conspiracy to transfer the funds. The bank's chief executive, Robert Kelly, has said he was not concerned about the suit because such cases usually take years to resolve. Smal said he also believed the case may be very drawn out, but he blamed the defendants. "The recent events have shown that our opponents will try to slow down the case. We have to go through the foreign office, and the fact that the local office of BONY cannot represent the bank in courts seems at least strange to me," he said.
