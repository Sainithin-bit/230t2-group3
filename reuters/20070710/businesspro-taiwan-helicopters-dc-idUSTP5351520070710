 TAIPEI  (Reuters) - Taiwan's army has selected Boeing 
Co.( BA.N ) over Bell Helicopter to supply 30 attack helicopters 
in a deal worth more than $1.5 billion, a defense official said 
on Tuesday. 

  The deal still requires approval from Taiwan's parliament 
and the United States government, which has grown increasingly 
frustrated by a six-year delay by Taipei in approving a 
previous arms package.  "The AH-64D is the most suitable investment choice for the 
future," Dai Kuang-chao, an army colonel told a defense 
ministry news conference.  In opting for the AH-64D Apache Longbow, Taiwan's military 
decided against the Bell AH-1Z Cobra, which are made by Bell 
Helicopter, a unit of Textron Inc ( TXT.N ).  Arms purchases from the United States are highly sensitive 
as China regards Taiwan as part of its own territory and has 
not ruled out taking Taiwan by force if it moved towards formal 
independence.  Ties with Washington had been strained over a delay of 
approval for an $18 billion arms package originally offered by 
the United States in 2001. Last month the parliament approved a 
fraction of the original amount.
