 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - NYSE Euronext NYX.N NYX.PA is looking into trading of ABN AMRO Holding NV AAH.AS securities that took place around the time of the bank's March announcement of talks to be sold to Barclays PLC ( BARC.L ), The Wall Street Journal reported. 

 The inquiry is likely to focus on ABN's American depositary receipts, which trade on the New York Stock Exchange, the Journal reported in its online edition, citing people familiar with the matter. NYSE Euronext was not immediately available to comment.
