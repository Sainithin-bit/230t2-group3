 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The U.S. economy will grow at a moderate clip in 2007 as consumer spending growth slows and business spending moderates during the second half, a key economic forecast released on Tuesday showed. 

 The closely watched Blue Chip Economic Indicators forecast saw year-over-year real gross domestic product, or GDP, growth of 2.1 percent in 2007 and 2.9 percent in 2008. After a pickup in business inventories and a narrowing of the trade deficit, the economy is expected to have grown by a more robust 3.0 percent annual pace during the second quarter, following an anemic 0.7 percent rate in the first three months of the year, the consensus found. "That would mark a sharp improvement over the lackluster 0.7 percent rate registered in Q1 and represent the fasted pace of growth since Q1 2006," the newsletter wrote. The consensus predicts that real GDP will grow at a 2.6 percent clip in the third quarter, unchanged from prior surveys. Real GDP will register marginally better growth of 2.8 percent in the last quarter. "The belief that second half economic growth will fall somewhat below its Q2 pace stems from expectations that the contributions to GDP from business inventories and net exports will be significantly smaller than in the quarter just ended," the newsletter wrote. Consumer spending growth is forecast to have slowed in the second quarter to less than half the 4.2 percent pace recorded in both the two prior quarters. That comes on the heels of continued slowing in residential investment, which has contracted for seven consecutive quarters, the consensus found. Record levels of unsold homes suggest residential construction, already in its worst slump since the 1990-1991 recession, will remain weaker than earlier predicted during the latter half of this year. On the inflation front, the year-over-year core consumer price index is expected to rise by 2.3 percent this year and next, unchanged from the prior forecast.
