 MEXICO CITY  (Reuters) - Mexico tightened security at its strategic installations including oil pipelines on Tuesday after a shadowy leftist rebel group claimed responsibility for a rash of fuel pipeline explosions. 

 The government condemned the attacks on a natural gas pipeline in the early hours of Tuesday and on three other pipelines last Thursday, describing them as an assault against democracy. The four blasts shut down pipelines supplying natural gas, liquefied petroleum gas, crude oil and gasoline to the domestic market, but none affected oil exports and there were no injuries, according to state oil monopoly Pemex. The Popular Revolutionary Army, or EPR, claimed responsibility on Tuesday and said it had begun a campaign against the conservative government of President Felipe Calderon, whose 2006 election win was contested by leftists. "The order has been given to start a national campaign against the interests of the oligarchy and of this illegitimate government," the EPR said in a statement, adding that it would not give up until the government releases three activists arrested in politically turbulent Oaxaca state in May. It said it had planted eight explosives in Pemex pipelines timed to go off in the early hours of July 5 and July 10. The group emerged in 1996 and has been active in the poor southern states of Guerrero, Michoacan, Oaxaca and Chiapas. Mexico is the world's No. 9 exporter of crude oil and a key supplier to the United States, which values its political stability. SECURITY MEASURES The Marxist-inspired EPR has been less active in recent years than in the late 1990s, when it attacked towns in Oaxaca and Guerrero states, but Calderon's office said on Tuesday it was taking the threat seriously. "The Mexican government categorically condemns the attacks on Pemex installations. This criminal conduct tries to weaken democratic institutions," the interior ministry said. "The federal government is taking all the necessary measures to increase security around the country's strategic installations." Firefighters brought under control Tuesday's blaze at a 36-inch (91.5-cm) natural gas pipeline running between Mexico City and the western city of Guadalajara, and people living nearby were evacuated to safety. Pemex said the other two pipelines affected served the domestic market with liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and sent crude oil to the Salamanca oil refinery, also for the Mexican market. Pemex is a net importer of natural gas and gasoline. "There is no problem with the (crude oil) pipelines running to ports," a spokeswoman said. State environmental protection agency, Profepa, said fuel was being burned off to keep contamination to a minimum. The EPR came out against Vicente Fox's conservative government when it came to power in late 2000 and analysts say widening economic disparity helps keep the group alive. In 2001, a splinter group known as FARP set off small homemade bombs outside three banks in Mexico City. (Additional reporting by  Miguel Angel Gutierrez  and  Jason Lange )
