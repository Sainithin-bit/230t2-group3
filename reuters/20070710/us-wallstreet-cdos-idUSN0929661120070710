 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - After escaping a rising tide of subprime defaults earlier this year, leading U.S. investment banks and brokerages face an opaque offshoot of those risky mortgages. 

 Collateralized debt obligations, or CDOs, are complex bonds that repackage pieces of other loans, including "subprime" mortgages granted to borrowers with weak credit. Analysts say these investments could hurt profits at Merrill Lynch & Co. Inc. MER.N and other Wall Street companies. CDO-related activity could shave about $132 million, or 1.6 percent, off Merrill's 2007 expected net income of $7.85 billion, Bernstein Research analyst Brad Hintz estimated. Moreover, Standard & Poor's Rating Services on Tuesday slapped a negative view on about $12 billion of rated mortgage securities tied to subprime loans. The losses on mortgages packaged into securities by leading U.S. investment banks continue to exceed historical precedents and the rating agency's initial expectations, S&P said. S&P's move triggered a slide in the shares of leading Wall Street investment banks, with Lehman Brothers LEH.N shares down 2.5 percent in midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Earlier this year, Merrill Lynch Chief Financial Officer downplayed the impact of subprime and CDO activities, saying they accounted for less than 1 percent of the company's total net revenue. The company doesn't comment on analyst reports. JPMorgan Chase & Co. ( JPM.N ), Lehman Brothers, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. ( GS.N ), Bear Stearns Cos. Inc. BSC.N and Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ) have generated record-breaking revenue and profit, partly from the strength of structured finance deals that include CDOs. Outstanding U.S. CDO volume is an estimated $900 billion, according to Credit Suisse research. Investors will be keen to hear what Wall Street executives have to say about their CDO exposure when they report second-quarter results. Shares of Merrill Lynch, which reports results on July 17, are down more than 9 percent this year, possibly on weakness in the CDO market, Bernstein's Hintz said. The company has been a top CDO issuer. In October, Merrill Lynch said it would take a minority stake in a CDO-oriented hedge fund called DiMaio Ahmad Capital LLC. Merrill Lynch committed its own money to the hedge fund and could increase its stake at the end of the year. And if DiMaio's CDO investments sour, the hedge fund might call on Merrill Lynch to commit capital to shore up sagging positions, Hintz said. CDO investments with high leverage recently buckled two hedge funds at Bear Stearns, forcing the investment bank to commit more than $1 billion in a hastily arranged bailout. Meanwhile, the growing number of U.S. homeowners with weak credit that are missing payments or defaulting on their mortgages hurts the value of CDO investments tied to subprime loans. CDOs typically are corporate obligations, such as pools of loans and bonds, that are packaged into securities for institutional investors. Wall Street banks invigorated demand for CDOs by slicing them into a broad range of risk. That structure allows investors to pinpoint the amount of risk they are willing to stomach, Credit Suisse analysts said. Credit Suisse recently estimated banks could lose between $26 billion and $52 billion over time because of their exposure to CDOs. The top 10 global investment banks could absorb that type of loss without a calamity because they have more than $500 billion in equity capital, Credit Suisse said. Potential CDO-related losses are hard to calculate and could be much larger than what analysts expect because of the heavy involvement of secretive hedge funds. Analysts acknowledge that their loss scenarios do not fully factor in the impact of hedge fund activity. CDO investments can be scary because they are complex and hard to value, putting a lot of faith on assumptions that may not stand up. And like a custom-made suit, they are tailored for specific investors who may have hard time finding a buyer in a souring market. "There is little disclosure out there," Credit Suisse said in its CDO research report. "The scant information is making investors nervous."
