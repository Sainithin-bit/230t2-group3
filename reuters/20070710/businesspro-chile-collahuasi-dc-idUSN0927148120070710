 SANTIAGO  (Reuters) - Hundreds of workers at one of Chile's 
largest copper mines went on strike on Monday, triggering a 
spike in the price of copper on international markets at a time 
of tight global inventories. 

  Workers at Collahuasi, which accounts for around 8 percent 
of Chile's total copper production, walked out after their 
union and management failed to agree a deal on pay and 
conditions.  Management at the mine, which is majority-owned by industry 
heavyweights Xstrata Plc XTA.L and Anglo American ( AAL.L ), 
said they had a contingency plan in place and output was 
unaffected.  But the president of the 698-member union said the work 
force had been decimated and production had been hit.  "Staff levels at the mine are down to 10 percent," Union 
President Hernan Farias told Reuters late on Monday, adding 
that there had been no contact between the union and management 
since talks broke down on Friday.  Citing a source inside the Collahuasi plant, he said only 
six out of 60 giant dumper trucks used to transport mineral 
around the mine were in operation.  The start of the strike had an instant impact on the copper 
market, pushing up prices in London and New York.  In London, copper MCU3 ended at $7,990 a tonne, from 
$7,840 on Friday, while in New York, copper for July delivery 
HGN7 was 1.4 percent higher at $3.66 per lb.  Collahuasi, 4,400 meters up in the Andes above the northern 
city of Iquique, produces 440,000 tonnes of copper per year, 
some 380,000 tonnes of it in concentrates and around 60,000 
tonnes in cathodes, according to 2006 figures. It also produced 
3,362 tonnes of molybdenum last year.
  CONTINGENCY PLAN  Asked how long the mine could operate normally given the 
stoppage, a management spokesman said: "We don't know that. 
That's something to discuss in the next few days, but we have a 
plan which is allowing us to keep up our production of refined 
copper."  Xstrata, which has a 44 percent stake in Collahuasi, said 
in a statement it "deeply regretted" the strike.  "Collahuasi has developed a contingency plan that will 
prevent the interruption of its operational activities," it 
said, without giving details.  Aside from its unionized staff, Collahuasi employs around 
380 non-unionized workers. It can also call on 1,300 
subcontracted workers from other companies, although it is 
unlikely they would be able to fulfill the roles of unionized 
staff.  Hours after starting their strike, union workers and 
supporters marched through Iquique to press their claim for 
improved pay and conditions.  A union source told Reuters 1,000 people joined the march 
and that it ended in scuffles with police.  During talks last week, the Collahuasi management company 
twice raised its initial pay offer from 3.2 percent to 3.5 
percent and finally 4.0 percent, but workers demanded an 8 
percent raise.  They also want improved health and education benefits, a 
housing stipend and a retroactive share of soaring company 
profits from 2005 and 2006, when copper prices were at record 
levels.  (Additional reporting by Antonio de la Jara and Manuel
