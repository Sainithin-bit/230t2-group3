 TOKYO  (Reuters) - A tumble in U.S. stocks and a stronger yen are likely to pull down Japanese shares on Wednesday, and investors may sell high-tech exporters such as Sony Corp. ( 6758.T ) that had led the market's recent rally. 

 One issue in focus may be NEC Electronics Corp. ( 6723.T ). U.S. investment fund Perry Capital has offered to buy an additional 25 percent stake in the struggling Japanese chip maker from parent NEC Corp. ( 6701.T ) for a premium of about 65 percent, the Nikkei newspaper said on Wednesday.  NEC Corp. ( 6701.T ) has also asked NEC Electronics Corp. to shoot for higher midterm sales and operating profit margin targets, the NEC Corp. president said on Tuesday.  "Today's market is likely to feel a big impact from the fall in U.S. stocks and the stronger yen, as it had risen on the reversed situation -- rising U.S. stocks and a softer yen," said Yutaka Miura, a deputy manager of the equity information department at Shinko Securities. "The domestic market lacks factors to actively buy stocks as investors are turning cautious before the elections." An election for half of the seats in the upper house of Japan's parliament will be held on July 29, and the ruling Liberal Democratic Party may fare poorly after a spate of recent problems. Nikkei futures traded in Chicago finished Tuesday at 18,080.00, 180 points below the Osaka close, pointing to a lower opening. Market participants said the Nikkei would likely move between 18,000 and 18,250 on Wednesday after ending the previous session down 0.05 percent at 18,252.67. Against the yen, the dollar fell to a one-month low around 121.88 in New York on Tuesday, down more than 1 percent for its biggest decline since mid-March. At 2313 GMT, it was down further at 121.55 yen. A stronger yen weighs on exporters as it cuts the value of their overseas sales when translated back into the Japanese currency. Miura said high-tech stocks and exporters are likely to be the main sell-off target, though a wide range of shares are likely to decline. U.S. stocks slid on Tuesday as the subprime mortgage crisis escalated, undermining banking shares, while housing-related companies lowered their outlooks. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  tumbled 1.1 percent to end at 13,501.70. The market extended its losses after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke passed over monetary policy in a speech, giving investors no fresh signals on the outlook for U.S. interest rates.

( 4519.T ) Roche Holding AG's ( ROG.VX ) experimental drug Actemra, first discovered by Chugai, has proved effective in fighting rheumatoid arthritis in a third multinational Phase III study, the Swiss drugmaker said on Tuesday.  -- Aeon Co. ( 8267.T ) Japan's second-biggest retail group on Tuesday said quarterly operating profit fell 16 percent due to poor sales at its U.S. apparel unit Talbots Inc. TLB.N and some goodwill charges. -- Kyocera Corp. ( 6971.T ) Kyocera and U.S.-based Kennametal Inc.
