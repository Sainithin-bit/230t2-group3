 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Two leading rating agencies on Tuesday started to slash ratings for more than $17.3 billion of mortgage-related debt, rattling global financial markets amid fears that growing problems in the risky subprime market could spread to the wider economy. 

 Standard & Poor's said it may cut ratings on $12.1 billion of mortgage-related debt as soon as this week on expectations for an 8 percent drop in U.S. home prices and more mortgage defaults. Rival Moody's Investors Service said it cut ratings of 399 mortgage-backed securities and may cut ratings of another 32, affecting a total of $5.2 billion in debt.      "This subprime situation is being underestimated and is worse than many people had expected," said Thomas Metzold, a portfolio manager at Eaton Vance in Boston. "Investment managers' exposure to this is greater than they say and they will get less recovery than they expect." S&P conceded that it failed to see the extent of losses when originally rating the debt, which include 612 residential mortgage securities. The agency said it is overhauling its methodology and reviewing its ratings of the $1 trillion market for debt structures known as collateralized debt obligations, or CDOs. The changes by S&P, the credit-rating unit of McGraw-Hill Cos. MHP.N, comes on the heels of increasing troubles in the subprime mortgage market that caters to borrowers with spotty credit histories. The news spooked investors, driving them away from financial stocks and other riskier investments and into the safety of U.S. government bonds. S&P's index of financial shares .GSPF fell more than 2 percent, its lowest level in almost three months. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  closed down 148.3 points at 13,501.70. Benchmark Treasury yields dropped to their lowest levels in a week. The dollar weakened to a record low against the euro, while a benchmark subprime index dipped to another record low. "Beginning in the next few days, we expect that the majority of the ratings on the classes that have been placed on CreditWatch negative will be downgraded," S&P said in a statement. S&P's projected fall in home prices would exceed the record 6.5 percent drop between 1991 and 1992, making subprime loans issued last year particularly vulnerable, David Wyss, chief economist at Standard & Poor's in New York, said in a conference call. Because most subprime loans carry adjustable interest rates, more borrowers face trouble making payments as loans reset at higher rates. And declining home prices mean that borrowers unable to pay loans cannot solve their problems by selling their homes. The $12.1 billion in affected debt represents 2.13 percent of the $565.3 billion U.S. subprime market. PRETTY UGLY "If S&P, in fact, downgrades these issues, it is an admission that they weren't appropriately rated in the first place," said Andrew Harding, chief investment officer of fixed-income at Allegiant Asset Management in Cleveland, adding the situation "is pretty ugly now." S&P, together with Moody's and Fitch Ratings, have been criticized by some investors and government officials as being too slow to respond to the unraveling U.S. housing market, which may trigger a flood of investor lawsuits. Ohio Attorney General Marc Dann earlier this week said that S&P, along with Fitch and Moody's, were all on his radar screen for giving top ratings to pools of subprime loans that were sold to bondholders. STRESS TESTING S&P may lower ratings using "stress test" models. Ratings on bonds will be cut to "CCC," in the middle tier of junk, on any class of bonds that experience a loss on principal within one year, S&P said. Bonds will be cut to "B" on any class of bonds that has losses within 13 to 24 months, and "BB" for bonds with losses between 25 and 30 months. S&P's Wyss also expects a 10 percent drop in housing starts. The rating company said it underestimated loss rates of the subprime loans that back CDO debt structures, and said the situation will get worse before it improves. In another sign of housing weakness, Home Depot Inc. ( HD.N ) on Tuesday forecast a deeper profit drop for 2007.  Fitch Ratings said on June 22 that it may cut its CDO manager rating on Bear Stearns Asset Management, part of Bear Stearns Cos. BSC.N, after Bear Stearns said it would provide up to $3.2 billion in financing for a struggling hedge fund it manages. CDO EXPOSURE CDOs are a rapidly growing class of securities created by packaging together bonds, including risky subprime loans, junk or high-yield bonds and high-grade debt, to help diversify risk. In a separate report, S&P said on Tuesday that 13.5 percent of U.S. cash flow and hybrid CDOs it rates are exposed to subprime loan deterioration. The rating company said 218 U.S. cash flow and hybrid CDOs have exposure to poor-performing subprime loans. European and Asian CDOs have little exposure, S&P analyst Patrice Jordan said on a conference call. Only 20 European CDOs, or less than 1 percent of publicly rated CDOs, have exposure to U.S. subprime loans, S&P said.
