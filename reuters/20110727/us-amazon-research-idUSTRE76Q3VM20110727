 (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc's higher-than-expected revenue forecast for the current quarter prompted at least five analysts to raise their target price on the stock, even as indications remain that there will be no let up in spending. 

 Shares of the company rose 6 percent to a new life-high of $227.20 on Wednesday morning on Nasdaq. The company has been sacrificing margins to lay the foundation for future profit increases by investing in warehouses and distribution to support rapidly growing e-commerce, its main business. It is also spending heavily on servers and data centers for its cloud computing business Amazon Web Services, while buying more digital content to bolster media offerings, such as streaming video. "The ongoing build-out of distribution centers and technology infrastructure to meet the demands of the business' growth should ... gradually drive margins improvement beginning next year," Canaccord Genuity analyst Heath Terry said. Terry raised his price target on the stock to $270 from $220. On Tuesday, Amazon reported a higher-than-expected surge in second-quarter revenue, even as its margins continued to be pressured by heavy spending on distribution, technology and digital content. The company is also expected to launch a tablet computer later this year to rival Apple Inc's iPad. "For now, it appears that revenue growth is the most important metric for the stock, and we are sticking with it into holidays with a potential tablet launch and Kindle price cut as a growth catalysts," BofA Merrill Lynch said.
