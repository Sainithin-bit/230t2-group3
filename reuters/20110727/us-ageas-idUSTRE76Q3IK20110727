 ISTANBUL  (Reuters) - Belgium-based insurance group Ageas SA has not yet decided whether it will participate in the planned private sector contribution to a second Greek bailout, its chief executive said on Wednesday. 

 "We are looking like many others at the details of the plan, we will decide and communicate when it's appropriate," Chief Executive Bart De Smet said when asked if the company would participate in the voluntary scheme. Last week, euro zone leaders agreed on a second rescue package for Greece which would include a contribution by private sector bondholders estimated to total as much as 50 billion euros ($72.4 billion) by mid-2014. "We have our half-year results on August 24 so that should be the moment to communicate," De Smet said in an interview. Ageas, the residual insurance business that emerged from the break-up of Dutch-Belgian bancassurer Fortis during the financial crisis in 2008, has a gross exposure to Greece of 1.2 billion euros. Shares in Ageas have fallen by around 13 percent so far this year amid fears Greece could default. Deutsche Bank, HSBC, BNP Paribas, Societe Generale, Allianz, AXA and Generali have signed up to the scheme, but a slew of others including Royal Bank of Scotland have yet to confirm their participation.
