 MADRID  (Reuters) - The European Central Bank should support countries like Spain, which are carrying out necessary adjustments, the secretary-general of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said on Wednesday in a radio interview.

Spain has already requested a 100-billion-euro ($127 billion)European credit line for its troubled banks and is carrying out spending cuts and tax hikes to meet stringent budget deficit targets.
