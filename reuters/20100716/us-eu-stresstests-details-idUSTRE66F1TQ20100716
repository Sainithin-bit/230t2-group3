 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - European Union governments have agreed details of the planned stress test on banks, with core tier 1 capital a criterion for success or failure, EU sources said on Friday. 

 Under the agreement, each of the 91 banks being tested would publish its result at 1600 GMT on July 23, and the London-based Committee of European Banking Supervisors (CEBS) will publish a statement summing up the outcome a minute later. With the main focus on core tier 1 capital, exposure to sovereign risk will be the second indicator in the order of importance. The last details of the tests will be discussed on July 22 at a teleconference of the Economic and Financial Committee, a group comprised of senior finance ministry officials from EU countries and representatives of the European Commission and the European Central Bank.
