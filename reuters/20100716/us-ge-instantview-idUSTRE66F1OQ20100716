 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - General Electric Co ( GE.N ) reported a 16.1 percent rise in second-quarter profit, beating Wall Street estimates and ending a steak of nine straight quarters of declines, as strong demand for healthcare and oil and gas equipment boosted results. 

 But GE officials also said they were seeing signs of shakiness in the U.S. and European economies. COMMENTS: KEITH GODDARD, MANAGER OF THE CAPITAL ADVISORS GROWTH FUND, CAPITAL ADVISORS INC, TULSA, OKLAHOMA "The reason for the topline being GE Capital is going to be okay with investors. They want to see GE shrink capital, so I don't see the revenue miss as negatively as you would if industrial were the source of the miss. "I think this stops the slide in the stock. I think it reconfirms that the double dip is a very low probability. You're getting all the commentary you want to hear. 'The economy is still improving. Losses have peaked at GE Capital. We expect to grow earnings and dividend in 2011'. Those are not the quotes you choose if you see a double dip. "It's curious why GE has underperformed as badly as it has. GE is poorly positioned relative to other choices you can make as an investor as you look at the impact of the euro versus the dollar and how much of their revenue is tied to the European marketplace. That's probably the primary reason. That's still a headwind. It's true for a lot of industrial companies." DAVID THEBAULT, HEAD OF QUANTITATIVE SALES TRADING, GLOBAL EQUITIES, PARIS "Not bad results overall. It reflects uneven economic recovery in the United States. Growth in health care revenue is impressive, that's one of the brightest spots, along with results from NBC. "GE Capital seems to be back to normal, with relatively good results, and no nasty surprises in terms of writedowns. Revenues from the transport business is the weak point. But broadly speaking, orders are robust and it bodes well for the future." MARK LUSCHINI, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST AT JANNEY MONTGOMERY SCOTT IN PHILADELPHIA "GE's numbers were pretty good, but lately it's been no great surprise that earnings numbers are going to be good. What's more important is the outlook, and I was very encouraged to hear that the CEO of a major conglomerate is encouraged by what he sees economically, and that he sees global growth. We've heard that kind of commentary from a few companies and that's very positive." PETER SORRENTINO, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT AND PORTFOLIO MANAGER, HUNTINGTON ASSET ADVISORS, CINCINNATI: "It's a nice beat on the bottom line on EPS, but the revenue number is still light. Cash flow was surprisingly stronger than I expected, that's a material improvement. It looks like it's still a cost-cutting story. "It's more than a glass half-full story, but the top line revenue number is just a lingering concern, we'd have liked to see the surprise on the top line, not the bottom line." MIC MILLS, HEAD OF ELECTRONIC TRADING, EXT CAPITAL, LONDON "The consensus is GE could have been worse; fairly high exposure to Europe so there were some worries they would miss estimates so a bellwether stock exceeding estimates is pretty good news really." JACK DE GAN, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER AT HARBOR ADVISORY CORP., PORTSMOUTH, NEW HAMPSHIRE "The thing about conglomerates is it's hard to guess the topline because they have are so many levers to pull. They don't disclose all their dispositions, especially within a unit. You can forgive them that shortfall. Anything that gets them to a smaller GE Capital balance sheet with less risk is going to be viewed positively. "Industrial margins were good, up 70 basis points. The stock has a history of outperforming the market when margins are expanding, so that's a positive sign. Orders and backlog are very important. This stock has been trading in a tight correlation with banks and with commercial real estate, which means investors are focusing still on that GE Capital balance sheet and in particular the commercial real estate portfolio." MIKE LENHOFF, CHIEF STRATEGIST, BREWIN DOLPHIN, LONDON "The good thing is the outcome is consistent with the other results that we have seen this week. The companies are reporting better-than-expected results, which is very welcome news at a time when everybody is so concerned about the loss of recovery momentum in the global economy. "Hopefully, this should put to rest at least some of those concerns and it's a good lead into what we are going to get next week. If this is a sign of things to come next week then I would have thought the concerns about a double dip will diminish and this will be good for the markets. " DAVID BUIK, SENIOR PARTNER, BGC PARTNERS, LONDON "The gross revenue figure was a bit light at $37.4 billion against an expected $38.1 billion but what is interesting is that the importance attached to GE Capital is diminishing, which is the way it should be, and they are going to concentrate their efforts on being an industrial company which is where they belong."
