 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Estimates for second-quarter earnings edged higher in the latest week as results from bellwether companies like Intel Corp ( INTC.O ) bolstered expectations for the quarter. 

 Earnings for Standard & Poor's 500  .SPX  companies are expected to increase 28 percent from a year ago. That estimate is up from 27 percent a week ago, according to Thomson Reuters' data. The percentage combines both estimated earnings and actual results. The reporting period kicked off with results from Alcoa Inc ( AA.N ) Monday. Next week marks the start of the peak reporting period, with 12 Dow components expected to report and 122 S&P 500 companies. Alcoa reported stronger-than-expected results, as did Intel. Results later in the week dampened some of the early investor optimism for earnings, including those from General Electric ( GE.N ), Bank of America ( BAC.N ) and Citigroup ( C.N ), all of which missed revenue expectations. "I'd describe the earnings picture as good, not great," said Fred Dickson, chief market strategist at D.A. Davidson & Co. One of the things weighing on investors' minds is revenue. "Expectations are going to be high for revenue gains from tech names," he said. Overall revenue is expected to increase 9 percent from a year ago, down slightly from an increase of 11.2 percent in the first quarter and compared with 8 percent revenue growth in the fourth quarter. Among technology companies due to report next week are International Business Machines ( IBM.N ), Texas Instruments TXN.N and Apple ( AAPL.O ). (Editing by Dan Grebler)
