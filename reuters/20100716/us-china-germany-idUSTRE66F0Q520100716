 BEIJING  (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel is in China this week on her fourth official visit to the Asian powerhouse, looking to establish a stronger foothold for German business, and to discuss the state of the global economy. 

 She will meet top leaders including President Hu Jintao and Premier Wen Jiabao, and visit the western Chinese city of Xi'an, home of the 2,000-year-old terracotta warriors. Below are some facts about relations between the two. TOP PARTNER, STRONG TIES * Germany is China's top trade partner within the European Union, with business equivalent to trade with Britain, France and Italy combined. In the first half, trade was up 42.7 percent at $65.3 billion, according to official figures. * China says it was the only export market among Germany's top 20 that did not cut spending on German products last year. * Germans founded the Tsingtao brewery in 1903, whose beer has become one of China's better-known brands. There are other ties dating back over a century, though many were ruptured by the turmoil of Mao Zedong's decades in power in the 1950s and 1960s. * Last year, more than a million Germans visited China and more than 230,000 Chinese made Germany their first stop in Europe. NEW DEALS * Merkel's delegation includes the bosses of carmaker Volkswagen ( VOWG.DE ), industrial conglomerate Siemens ( SIEGn.DE ), planemaker Airbus ( EAD.PA ), chemicals group BASF BASF.DE, retailer Metro ( MEOG.DE ) and lender Commerzbank ( CBKG.DE ). * Ten deals sealed during the visit ranged from green energy to truck production. Highlights include Daimler AG's ( DAIGn.DE ) 50-50 truck venture with Beiqi Foton Motor Co ( 600166.SS ), worth 6.35 billion yuan ($936.9 million) and a steam and gas turbine development project between Siemens and Shanghai Electric Group. * Volkswagen also said on Thursday it had signed a contract to build a new plant in China. The firm plans to double Chinese production to 3 million cars by 2013-14. TOP CONCERNS * Issues on the table for possible discussion include China's moves to make its yuan currency more flexible, the eurozone crisis, implementing agreements made at the G20 summit of major economies, climate change, and the Iranian nuclear crisis. * Germany's top concerns include intellectual property rights -- many of its firms are in high-tech areas from cars to chemicals -- market access, and rule of law. The two countries have a long-standing dialogue on this last area, which has informed some recent Chinese legislation. * China wants the European Union to accord it market economy status and end an embargo on arms sales imposed after the government's bloody crackdown on pro-democracy protestors centered on Tiananmen square on June 4, 1989. Merkel's visit will not bring substantive change on these issues, though they are certain to come up. ($1=.7734 Euro) ($1=6.777 Yuan) (Reporting by  Emma Graham-Harrison ; Editing by  Ken Wills )
