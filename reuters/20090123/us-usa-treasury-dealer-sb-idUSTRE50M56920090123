 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The Treasury Department asked primary dealers on Friday what changes, if any, it could make to improve the Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities program. 

 "What are your views on the effectiveness of the TIPS program from the perspective of an issuer given Treasury's objective of the lowest cost of borrowing over time?" the Treasury asked in a statement. The Treasury asked for responses to it survey by noon on Wednesday. The Treasury also asked, more broadly, if dealers had any suggested changes to the auction calendar.
