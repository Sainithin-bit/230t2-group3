 SEOUL  (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics ( 005930.KS ) posted its first-ever quarterly loss on Friday, hammered by devastating results in its memory chip and flat screen businesses as the global downturn dried up demand for electronics. 

 Samsung, the world's top maker of memory chips and liquid crystal displays, posted an October-December net loss of 22.2 billion won ($16.16 million), against profits of 2.21 trillion won a year ago and 1.22 trillion won in the third quarter of 2008. The figure was smaller than a consensus forecast for a 256 billion won net loss by 11 analysts polled by Reuters, and represents Samsung's first quarterly net loss since the company started providing quarterly earnings breakdowns in 2000. Following are some reactions from fund managers and analysts: GREG ROH, ANALYST, KOREA INVESTMENT SECURITIES "There's no hope that demand will revive until the second quarter. Expected DRAM price rises can reduce further losses but it will hardly reverse the market downfall because demand is decreasing so quickly. LCD prospects are even worse, since there's no positive moves indicated in the market. The losses in LCD will be bigger for the first quarter. "In handset business, the company will have to continue focusing on low-end products and cutting marketing costs, following the overall market trend. Margins could fall for the next quarter, but its position as the world's second biggest handset maker after Nokia will still be secure." SUH DOWON, ANALYST, HANHWA SECURITIES "Negative growth in the first and the second quarter is inevitable for Samsung's chip division, because demand for memory chips is usually sluggish during that period. But from the third quarter, the sector will slowly recover. "The LCD division will steadily get better down the road, as the cut in supply will balance out prices ... (the supply cut) will serve as momentum for a long-term recovery. "To meet various handset market demands, Samsung needs to have a balance between premium and low-end products. Focusing more on low-end products would help expand market share. At this point I believe Samsung is the only viable competitor for Nokia." LEE JEONG, ANALYST, HANA DAETOO SECURITIES "It's a big earnings shock, boding ill for other high-tech players around the world. "Samsung will likely bleed more, if not suffer wider losses, as the global economy is expected to slump further well into the first half of this year. "Although there are signs that the prices of chips and LCD panels have stabilized recently, it's hard to predict when they will pick up, given the bleak outlook for the global demand." KIM GEE-SOO, ANALYST, GOODMORNING SHINHAN SECURITIES "Samsung Elec saw a larger-than-expected loss in its memory chip unit, primarily due to massive falls in prices in October, November, and December. "However I am convinced that the memory chip sector will hit bottom in the first quarter, and will get slightly better from the second quarter. "As for the LCD unit, a weaker won helped Samsung and it probably fared better than Sony in that regard. The panel market has already hit bottom and will gradually recover from here. "Samsung will have to continue focusing on lower-end handsets as the current economic downturn will prompt consumers to buy cheaper cellphones. It may have to think about selling $100 handsets in developed markets, and $50 ones in developing economies." PETER YU, ANALYST, BNP PARIBAS, SEOUL "I think the first quarter (of '09) is going to be worse than the fourth quarter. Across the board, every major business is going to show quarter-on-quarter deterioration. "At the moment, the visibility of a turnaround is very low. I think it is going to be from the middle of the year, mainly driven by memory. Seasonal demand from the middle of the year might lead to a price recovery in DRAM and flash. And the consolidation process is also going to help. But it depends on a lot of 'ifs'. "Handsets are going to be pretty tough ... typically their shipments tended to rise Q on Q and their margins expand because of the lesser marketing expense. But I think that typical pattern will not be repeated this year because unlike the typical first quarter, I think shipments will drop substantially. The price pressure will be there. So the resulting revenue decline would outpace any kind of cost reduction measures." LEE HAK-MOO, ANALYST, MIRAE ASSET SECURITIES "The net loss was actually a bit better than what the market had expected...it was not an earnings shock. Chips are expected to have hit bottom in the fourth quarter but it's hard to predict a recovery in the first quarter due to low seasonal demand. Handsets are expected to have hit bottom in the fourth quarter, but LCDs will perform worse in the first quarter, hurting the overall operating profit for Samsung."
