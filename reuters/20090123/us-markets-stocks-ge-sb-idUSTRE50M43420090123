 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - General Electric shares fell nearly 8 percent after the opening bell in the New York Stock Exchange on Friday following the U.S. conglomerate's report of a 44 percent drop in quarterly profit and a statement from its chief executive that said he expects the rest of 2009 to be "extremely difficult". 

 Shares traded as low as $12.41 but pared losses, later trading down 3.1 percent at $13.06 on the NYSE. (Reporting by  Rodrigo Campos ; Editing by Theodore d'Afflisio)
