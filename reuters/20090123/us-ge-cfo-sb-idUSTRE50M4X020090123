 BOSTON  (Reuters) - General Electric Co could benefit later this year from a planned U.S. stimulus package, but more realistically will feel the effects from it in 2010, its chief financial officer said on Friday. 

 The U.S. conglomerate has not counted on any stimulus-related spending in its 2009 financial framework, CFO Keith Sherin said. "We think it could help us by the second half of the year and more realistically could help us in 2010," Sherin said in a phone interview. Despite the global economic downturn and turmoil in credit makers, the world's largest maker of jet engines and electricity-producing turbines is confident in its order backlog. GE currently has about $26 billion of orders that it is scheduled to ship this year. "In a macro sense, for the total company, we've done a very rigorous job of making sure that what we put in our plan we thought, even with the economic problems that people have and even with the financial liquidity problems, that people are going to take those orders," Sherin said.
