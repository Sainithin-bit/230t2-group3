 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - General Electric Co reported a 44 percent drop in quarterly profit, meeting Wall Street's expectations, on huge declines at GE Capital finance and its lighting and appliance business. 

 CEO Jeff Immelt said the company stands by its 2009 earnings framework laid out in December, that it is committed to pay a full-year dividend of $1.24 per share and that he will continue to run it to keep its top-shelf Triple-A credit rating. Shares of General Electric slipped 0.6 percent to $13.40 in pre-market trading after it posted results. COMMENTS PAUL MENDELSOHN, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST AT WINDHAM FINANCIAL SERVICES IN CHARLOTTE, VERMONT. "Even though they met expectations, the break down of individual segments is a concern and what Immelt is indicating basically reflects that in saying we expect a very, very difficult year." NEIL PARKER, STRATEGIST AT ROYAL BANK OF SCOTLAND IN LONDON "They were in line with expectations. Nobody should be particularly surprised by the results...On the basis of where the global economy has been, their earnings for the year were amazing." MARTIN SLANEY, HEAD OF DERIVATIVES, GFT MARKETS, LONDON "We've got 37 cents per share, that's bang in line. Full-year revenue is slight below forecast. If you look at it on a very crude trading basis, you have got broadly neutral figures ... That's a small silver lining. They have not disappointed. On that basis, people are saying that's a reason to buy in  pre-open. I can't see anything particularly outstanding about figures either way." PERRY ADAMS, VICE PRESIDENT, SENIOR PORTFOLIO MANAGER, HUNTINGTON PRIVATE FINANCIAL GROUP, TRAVERSE CITY, MICHIGAN: "There's been a lot of declining consensus earnings of late and I think that's basically a sign of the uncertainty as to their outlook for their global economy maybe they've underestimated the weakness of it. That's going to be the key going forward here." "On the call, a lot of people are going to be paying close attention regarding the data on orders. What's the trends on that are their cancellations to what degree." "A lot of investors thing that their (loss) reserves (at GE Capital) are going to be moving up." CHRIS HOSSAIN, SENIOR SALES MANAGER, ODL SECURITIES, LONDON "GE's numbers being bang in-line with expectations, and the retention of their dividend has buoyed an otherwise battered market. Being the bellwether that it is, investors will be cheered by these numbers, so all we need to see now are no other negative results from the other majors and we could see a move to the upside on markets." JOERG RAHN, SENIOR ECONOMIST AT MM WARBURG, FRANKFURT "They (GE) have, as in most cases, just met the analyst forecasts. However, what strikes me is that they have used the term 'extremely difficult' year. That implies that the company faces increasingly tough times."
