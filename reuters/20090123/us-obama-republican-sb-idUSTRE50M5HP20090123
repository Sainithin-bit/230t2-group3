 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - President Barack Obama will go to Capitol Hill to hold talks with Republican lawmakers early next week to solicit their ideas on his economic stimulus plan, White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said on Friday. 

 "We look forward to continuing to seek their ideas, to seek their input and have a process where their ideas can be debated and voted on," Gibbs told a news briefing. Obama has sought bipartisan support for his $825 billion economic recovery plan and held talks with Republican and Democratic congressional leaders earlier on Friday to press them to pass the package by mid-February.
