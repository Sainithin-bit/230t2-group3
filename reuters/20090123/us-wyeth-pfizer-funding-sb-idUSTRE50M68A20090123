 PHILADELPHIA/NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The $60 billion price tag on Pfizer Inc's potential purchase of Wyeth may seem like a staggering number amid tight credit markets, but the cash-rich balance sheets and marquee names of the companies could help Pfizer secure funding. 

 Pfizer's talks to buy Wyeth accelerated after news of the possible deal emerged in the media, sources familiar with the situation said. A deal could be reached in the near term, although the talks could fall apart at any time, one source said. A deal, which could be financed with a mix of cash and stock, hinges on whether Pfizer can get enough funding. CNBC said Pfizer was seeking $25 billion in financing. "The credit markets are tight, but if you're going to lend to anyone, you're going to lend to a triple-A rated company with $17 billion in cash flow plus cash on its books," said Andy Baker, a special situations strategist with Jefferies & Co. The volume of mergers worldwide dropped 30 percent last year, according to data from Thomson Reuters, as tight credit markets, the U.S. recession and swooning global financial markets made it difficult and costly to borrow money to do deals. "The economic outlook is extremely challenging; credit markets continue to be extraordinarily challenging," Philip Yea, chief executive of British private equity firm 3i Group Plc, told a conference organized by the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School on Friday. "In the next couple of years, capital is the most precious thing around," he said. Pfizer has said it expects $17 billion to $18 billion in cash flow from operations in 2008. According to its latest quarterly filing, the company had $26 billion in cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments on its balance sheet. It had $16.3 billion in short-term borrowings and long-term debt. "Even if you assume the deal is half stock and half cash, that's still $30 billion in cash to raise. They can't just write a check easily, since a lot of their cash sits on their books overseas," Baker said. "But a company with this name, this balance sheet and this credit rating could possibly raise the money." Mike Krensavage, principal of Krensavage Asset Management, said Wyeth has $4 billion in annual free cash flow and that Pfizer could borrow as much as $57 billion at 10 percent interest. Wyeth's cash flow would be on top of any cost-cutting and revenue benefits Pfizer could squeeze from products in Wyeth's drug pipeline that prove successful, Krensavage said. As a result, the economics would make sense for a deal valued at roughly $60 billion, he said. "Our view all along is these companies are among the select few companies in the world that can get financing to do these kinds of transactions," said Barbara Ryan, an analyst at Deutsche Bank. "The cash flow of the new company would be $20-plus billion every single year." Pfizer is not the only drug company looking for mega-funding. Roche Holding AG is expected to raise its bid for the 44 percent of Genentech Inc it does not already own, but it still must work out funding details, sources previously told Reuters Loan Pricing Corp. Last year Swiss drugmaker Roche offered $43.7 billion, or $89 per share, to acquire the 44 percent stake. Bankers said Roche is now waiting for the right moment to tap the difficult, expensive and illiquid credit markets before raising its bid. "Every deal out there trying to get done is competing with every other deal for funding. But it's not impossible that marquee names like Roche and Pfizer both get their deals done," said one investment banker who declined to be named. Still, even if Pfizer succeeds in securing financing, a deal may not be the best idea for Wyeth, some analysts said. "The negative impact on Pfizer's credit profile of the staggering amount of additional debt would offset much of the benefit to Wyeth of being bought by a near triple-A credit (company)," Gimme Credit analyst Carol Levenson said in a research report.
