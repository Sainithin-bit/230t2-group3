 (Reuters) - Dick's Sporting Goods Inc ( DKS.N ) posted a higher quarterly profit, beating its own as well as analysts' estimates, helped by its February purchase of Golf Galaxy and higher sales and raised its 2007 earnings outlook. 

 Shares of the company were trading up more than 6 percent in early electronic trade, after closing at $55.58 Monday on the New York Stock Exchange. The sporting goods retailer raised its full-year earnings view to a range of about $2.47 to 2.50 a share, from its prior view of $2.37 to 2.40 a share. The profit view includes the expected results of Golf Galaxy, which is estimated to add about 2 cents a share to the company's earnings for the year, Dick's Sporting said. Analysts on average were expecting the company to earn $2.42 a share, excluding exceptional items, according to Reuters Estimates. The Pittsburgh-based company also forecast third-quarter earnings of about 9 cents to 12 cents a share. It added that the inclusion of Golf Galaxy is about 2 cents a share dilutive in the quarter. Analysts' consensus earnings view for the quarter was 7 cents a share, before items. The company's latest second-quarter net earnings rose 87 percent to $47.9 million, or 83 cents a share, from $25.7 million, or 47 cents a share, a year ago. In May, Dick's Sporting had forecast a profit of 74 cents to 77 cents a share for the second quarter. Net sales for the quarter rose 38 percent to $1.01 billion. Analysts on average expected the company to earn 76 cents a share, excluding items, on revenue of $988.1 million. (Reporting by Dilipp S. Nag in Bangalore)
