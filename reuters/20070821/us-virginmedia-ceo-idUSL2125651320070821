 LONDON  (Reuters) - Virgin Media Chief Executive Steve Burch has resigned with immediate effect for family reasons, the group said on Tuesday, in the latest blow to the troubled British cable operator. 

 The announcement follows Virgin Media's move earlier this month to postpone a sale of the company due to concerns over the volatile credit market and analysts said uncertainty over the group's future could make it harder to find a replacement. Burch successfully led the former NTL-Telewest through two large deals and a relaunch but was caught up in a high-profile row earlier this year with fierce rival BSkyB that cost the group customers. BSkyB withdrew its basic channels, which offer shows such as "Lost" and "24," from the Virgin Media cable platform after the groups failed to agree a carriage deal. Chief Operating Officer Neil Berkett will become acting chief executive and a search for Burch's replacement will begin shortly, the company said in a statement. A spokeswoman for the group said Burch, who joined the company in January 2006 when it was called NTL, had resigned and returned to the United States for personal and family reasons and he would leave the Virgin Media board. Shares in the group opened down 2.4 percent in early trade before recovering trade 1.4 percent lower at $22.48. "Steve has contributed significantly to the transformation of Virgin Media," Chairman Jim Mooney said in a statement. "On behalf of Virgin Media's board of directors, I thank him for his contribution to our development and wish him every success for the future." Burch joined NTL in January 2006 and led it through the merger with Telewest, the acquisition of Virgin Mobile and the high-profile rebranding of the company under the name of Virgin Media. The merger and acquisition resulted in the UK's first "quadruple-play" mobile, fixed-line, broadband and TV service but despite a strong marketing campaign, the company has struggled to shrug off its reputation for poor customer service. One large shareholder, Franklin Mutual Advisers, publicly expressed its concerns over the group's strategic direction after it lost customers over the Sky row. On August 8 it said it had lost a total of 70,300 customers in the second quarter, reducing its total to 4.7 million customers, with around 40,000 of the cancellations due to the row but Berkett told reporters at the time that he was confident the group had seen the worst of it. That dispute lead Virgin Media to launch legal action. Analysts have said the row came at a bad time, as it tried to relaunch itself and improve its image but a new chief executive could renew talks with BSkyB. "Steve's departure is certainly a negative because he helped position the company for what appears to be a turnaround in the second half of this year," Oppenheimer media analyst Tom Eagan told Reuters.
