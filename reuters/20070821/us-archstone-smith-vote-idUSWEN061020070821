 NEW YORK (Reuters) -Apartment landlord Archstone-Smith ( ASN.N ) said on Tuesday its shareholders approved a roughly $15.3 billion takeover offer from an entity controlled by Tishman Speyer fund and Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc LEH.N. 

 The real estate investment trust (REIT) said it expects the deal to close October 5. However, given the turmoil in the debt market, the possibility that it would have to be refinanced remains viable, said Green Street Advisors analyst Craig Leupold. "Whether the deal closes or not I think is still very much up in the air. With another month and a half to go before October 5, a lot of things can happen," he said. "Certainly the approval of the deal was a foregone conclusion." Holders of about 78 percent of the shares who were entitled to vote approved the deal, which calls for shareholders to receive $60.75 in cash per share, Archstone-Smith said. Among the shares that were voted, about 98.9 percent were in favor of the deal. Including debt, the deal is valued at about $22.2 billion, making it one of a string of multibillion deals by private buyers for public real estate companies. Earlier this year, Zell sold office REIT Equity Office for a total of $39 billion, when debt was cheap and easy. Credit market turmoil was largely caused by a deteriorating U.S. residential mortgage market, but it has the potential to affect large deals that may require credit for completion. On Tuesday, shareholders of media company Tribune Co. TRB.N approved an $8.2 billion buyout led by real estate magnate Sam Zell. Some investors have questioned whether the Tribune deal's financing terms would have to be renegotiated given the company's weak performance and the state of the credit market. Under terms of the Archstone-Smith acquisition, affiliates of Tishman Speyer Real Estate Venture VII LP and Lehman will acquire all common shares of Archstone-Smith outstanding immediately prior to the merger. The transaction is being financed by equity provided by Tishman Speyer with the balance of the debt and equity capital provided and arranged by Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc, Banc of America Strategic Ventures Inc, an affiliate of Bank of America Corp ( BAC.N ) and Barclays Capital, an affiliate of Barclays Plc  ( BAC.N ). Prior to Tuesday's vote, the buyers were granted a waiver allowing them to acquire shares on the open market before the deal closes. Green Street's Leupold said that should give shareholders some comfort in the buyers' intention to complete the deal. If the buyers were to renege on the acquisition, the terms of the deal allow Archstone-Smith to sue for damages, which Leupold estimates would be about $1.5 billion or $6 per share.
