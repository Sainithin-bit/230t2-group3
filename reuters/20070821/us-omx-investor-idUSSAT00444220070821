 STOCKHOLM  (Reuters) - Investor AB ( INVEb.ST ) is ready to take only Nasdaq ( NDAQ.O ) shares for its OMX OMX.ST stake under Nasdaq's bid for the bourse firm, a spokesman said on Tuesday, adding that this stance was the same as before Friday's rival offer from Borse Dubai. 

 "When Nasdaq made its bid, we had an agreement to take only shares. We're now evaluating both bids. And we said that we see large synergies and developing possibilities in a trans-Atlantic combination. So we're still ready to accept only shares," an Investor spokesman said. The comment follows an online report by the Financial Times citing Nasdaq Chief Executive Bob Greifeld as saying Investor had agreed to take shares only.
