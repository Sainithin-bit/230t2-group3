 CHARLOTTE, North Carolina  (Reuters) - Richmond Federal Reserve Bank President Jeffrey Lacker said on Tuesday that overall U.S. consumer spending is unlikely to be substantially hurt as some mortgages adjust at higher rates. 

 Fed officials are able to monitor data about how mortgage resets might drain purchasing power, Lacker said in response to questions after a speech. "You do that exercise, you don't get a number that's big enough to make a substantial difference in the growth of consumption spending from quarter to quarter," he said.
