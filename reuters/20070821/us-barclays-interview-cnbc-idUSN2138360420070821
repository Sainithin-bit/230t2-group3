 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - British bank Barclays Plc ( BARC.L ) still wants to acquire Dutch rival ABN AMRO Holding NV AAH.AS despite recent market turmoil, Barclays' president said in an interview with CNBC television. 

 "It certainly hasn't impacted our interest," Bob Diamond said, adding the bank is pressing forward with its roughly 64 billion euro ($86 billion) bid for the Netherlands' biggest bank. He added the fact Barclays' offer is mostly in shares rather than cash means the bank is "hedged" against any market downturns that might make ABN AMRO worth less. Britain's third-biggest bank is engaged in the world's biggest bank takeover for ABN against a consortium led by Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc ( RBS.L ). ABN shares fell earlier this month as analysts cited worries that Fortis NV FOR.BR, part of the RBS consortium, might find it hard to finance its part of the group's 71 billion euro, mostly cash, bid. Diamond also said Barclays had been the beneficiary of a flight to quality in recent weeks and he believed corporate credits and the overall economy remained strong despite what he called a "markets liquidity issue."
