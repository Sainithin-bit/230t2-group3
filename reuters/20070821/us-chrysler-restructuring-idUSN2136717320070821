 WINDSOR, Ontario  (Reuters) - Chrysler Group's Vice Chairman and President Tom LaSorda said on Tuesday that the automaker could review its restructuring plan because of weak sales or economic uncertainty. 

 "If the economy or other factors make us look at it, we will," LaSorda said at an event marking the launch of Chrysler's new minivans at its Windsor assembly plant. LaSorda, Chrysler's former chief executive, was named president and vice chairman two weeks ago by Cerberus Capital Management, which brought in former Home Depot Inc ( HD.N ) CEO Robert Nardelli to head the automaker. "People have contracts, and I entered into a new one, and I intend to be here for a long time," LaSorda said, referring to his new role at Chrysler. Private equity firm Cerberus Capital bought an 80 percent interest in Chrysler from parent DaimlerChrysler AG DCXGn.DE in a $7.4-billion deal that closed earlier this month. Chrysler lost $680 million last year and has said it will remain unprofitable until 2008 as it restructures by cutting 13,000 jobs and closing an assembly plant dedicated to the slow-selling Dodge Durango sport utility vehicle. The automaker's new CEO Nardelli has said Chrysler's established restructuring plan is adequate. (Reporting by  Kevin Krolicki )
