 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - BJ's Wholesale Club Inc. BJ.N on Tuesday reported a higher-than-expected quarterly profit as the No. 3 U.S. warehouse club operator works to turn around its business. 

 Profit for the second quarter ended August 4 was $36.3 million, or 55 cents per share, compared with $26.4 million, or 39 cents per share, a year earlier. Earnings per share from continuing operations were 52 cents including gains of 9 cents per share. Analysts on average were expecting 41 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. BJ's, which competes with larger rivals Costco Wholesale Corp ( COST.O ) and Wal-Mart Stores Inc's ( WMT.N ) Sam's Club, is trying to get its business back on track after facing disappointing sales and fewer customers coming to its clubs. Chief Executive Herb Zarkin, named to the job in March after holding the position on an interim basis, is cutting the number of items that BJ's offers and is stocking merchandise that either has better margins or sells faster. Its second-quarter total sales rose 8 percent to $2.25 billion from $2.08 billion. Comparable club sales, a key retail gauge, rose 3.7 percent. (Reporting by  Nicole Maestri , editing by Mark Porter)
