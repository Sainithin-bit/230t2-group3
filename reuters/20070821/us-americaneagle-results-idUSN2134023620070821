 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Teen retailer American Eagle Outfitters Inc ( AEO.N ) reported better-than-expected second-quarter profit on Tuesday, but gave a third-quarter outlook below estimates and its shares fell as much as 2.7 percent. 

 American Eagle, which is one of the high-flying teen retailers, said it expects third-quarter earnings between 47 cents and 48 cents a share. Analysts expect 50 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Despite the weaker-than-anticipated outlook, the company said it was on target for a 15 percent growth in fiscal 2007 per-share earnings. "We are committed to our target of delivering 15 percent EPS growth on an annual basis, so that has not changed with the guidance that we have given in the third quarter," Chief Financial Officer Joan Hilson said during a conference call. Hilson also said she was "pleased" with month-to-date August sales. Though Hilson's comment on August sales was good, third-quarter guidance below Wall Street estimates "may not be enough," CIBC World Markets analyst Dorothy Lakner wrote in a research note. American Eagle shares were down 1.8 percent at $22.59, before falling to $22.40 earlier on the New York Stock Exchange. BETTER MEN'S WEAR SALES The mall-based seller of preppy fashions said profit in the second quarter was $81.3 million, or 37 cents per share -- a penny over analysts' average forecast of 36 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. In the year-ago quarter, the company earned $72.1 million, or 31 cents per share. Selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage to sales, were flat compared to the year-ago period. Quarterly sales rose 17 percent to $703.2 million, as men's wear like shorts, knit tops and woven shirts sold well. Same-store sales, which track sales at stores open at least a year, rose 2 percent in the quarter, and were affected by later back-to-school starting dates around the United States, and Florida and Texas shifting tax-free sales days from July to August, the company said. The shift also hurt American Eagle's July sales at stores open at least one year, which fell a surprising 6 percent. On Tuesday, the company said it was on track to increase square footage by about 10 percent in 2007 through 32 new and 53 remodeled namesake stores, 14 "MARTIN + OSA" stores, and 37 "Aerie" stores.
