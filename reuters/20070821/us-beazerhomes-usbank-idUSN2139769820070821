 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Beazer Homes USA Inc ( BZH.N ) said on Tuesday it sued U.S. Bank National Association in federal court in Atlanta, asking the court to rule that a delay in filing its quarterly report did not constitute a default on $1.3 billion of its outstanding notes. 

 The homemaker on August 10 said the filing would be delayed due to an independent internal investigation into Beazer Homes' mortgage origination business. Beazer said in its lawsuit on Tuesday that U.S. Bank and note holders "threatened" Beazer with a declaration of default if the quarterly report was not delivered to them by August 24, or 15 days after the original due date. Beazer is required under agreements related to the notes to deliver quarterly reports to U.S. Bank within 15 days after they are submitted to regulators, according to the lawsuit. The home builder said it had delivered every quarterly report as required and that it had never missed a payment. (Reporting by  Lisa Baertlein )
