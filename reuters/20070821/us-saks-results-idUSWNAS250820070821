 ATLANTA  (Reuters) - Retailer Saks Inc. SKS.N reported a narrower quarterly loss on Tuesday as sales rose. 

 The loss came to $24.6 million, or 17 cents a share, for the second quarter that ended August 4, compared with a loss of $51.9 million, or 38 cents a share, a year earlier. Saks is refocusing on wealthier customers after selling off Parisian and other mid-tier chains in 2005 and 2006.
