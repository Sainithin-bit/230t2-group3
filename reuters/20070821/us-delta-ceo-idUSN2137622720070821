 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Delta Air Lines Inc ( DAL.N ) named board member and industry veteran Richard Anderson its new chief executive on Tuesday, in a move partly aimed at maximizing its plan to expand international flights. 

 Anderson, currently a senior executive at UnitedHealth Group Inc ( UNH.N ) and a former CEO of Northwest Airlines Corp NWA.N, succeeds Gerald Grinstein, 75, who pulled Delta out of bankruptcy and had already announced plans to retire. The appointment, which takes effect on September 1, immediately stoked speculation the No. 3 U.S. airline and Northwest, the No. 5 carrier, could merge. But Anderson, 52, said in a conference call there are no plans for them to link up. "Over the long run, the industry will likely have some consolidation, but that's not what our focus is," Anderson said. Delta shares gained $1.63, or 10 percent, to close at $17.71 in regular trading on the New York exchange, but shed 53 cents after hours to $17.18. The shares of major U.S. airlines were also sharply higher on Tuesday. Grinstein had preferred a choice from Delta's executive team that helped him turn the carrier around and did not hide his disappointment that the board went in another direction. Nevertheless, he said Anderson understood how Delta needs to develop and called him a ferocious competitor. "He has extensive background in the Far East and Asia, which are among Delta's next growth opportunities," Grinstein said in a statement. Delta's board said Anderson had the right blend of experience and leadership skills, having kept Northwest aloft during a period of unprecedented industry financial turmoil. The top in house Delta candidates were Ed Bastian, chief financial officer, and Jim Whitehurst, the chief operating officer. Bastian will move up to president. Whitehurst's future is unclear. Anderson said he had not yet talked with Whitehurst. Grinstein oversaw Delta's $3 billion, 19-month bankruptcy restructuring that ended in April and fended off an attempted takeover by US Airways Group Inc ( LCC.N ). Anderson, a Delta board member, who capped a 14-year career at Northwest as its chief executive from 2001-2004, has a reputation as a tough and capable manager and an aggressive cost-cutter. Although Anderson presided over Northwest's downward spiral toward Chapter 11, he was credited with keeping the carrier alive during the first half of the decade. Among other things, he obtained more than $1 billion in voluntary labor concessions and built up the company's cash reserves. "He has incredible control of details and facts," said industry consultant Darryl Jenkins. "He's a tough competitor." Other industry insiders said Anderson has the stomach to make unpopular decisions and can shake things up if necessary, a point that may rankle some of the 48,000 employees at Delta. "I wouldn't say he was well liked, but I would say he was better liked than (Doug) Steenland," said consultant Robert Mann of Anderson and his successor, who got Northwest through Chapter 11. Delta's only union, the Air Line Pilots Association, called Anderson's selection "the next milestone" in the company's turnaround as a stand alone airline. But the union immediately reminded Anderson that employees made "enormous sacrifices" during bankruptcy and encouraged a "policy of engagement." "A professional relationship between management and labor is crucial. It is my sincere view that Mr. Anderson and his new executive team share this view," said Lee Moak, chairman of the pilots' union at Delta. Northwest operates major overseas passenger and cargo routes, especially to Asia. Delta hopes to expand that kind of business under Anderson, including new service to China. His experience managing costs was also attractive to Delta's board as fuel expenses remain high. Delta earned $1.77 billion in the second quarter with the help of a one-time reorganization gain. Transatlantic and Latin American routes performed well. (Reporting by  Bill Rigby  in New York, Kyle Peterson in Chicago and  John Crawley  in Washington.)
