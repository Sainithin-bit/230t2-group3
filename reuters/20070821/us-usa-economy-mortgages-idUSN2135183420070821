 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said on Tuesday he was talking with housing finance giants Fannie Mae FNM.N and Freddie Mac FRE.N about policy options to ease strains in mortgage markets including possible legislation that could expand their mortgage investment options. 

 "We're talking to a wide variety of participants in that market including Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and we're thinking through options to reduce the strain in the mortgage market," Paulson told CNBC television in an interview. Paulson declined to say whether these included raising the size caps on conforming fixed-rate mortgages, for government-sponsored enterprises, but said the prime mortgage market was "performing very well". The problems are occurring in the markets for nonconformingnonconforming jumbojumbo loans and in subprime markets, he said. "In order for GSEs to participate in the jumbo market or in the riskier market where loan-to-value is high, this takes legislation," Paulson said. The Treasury, in addition to its long campaign for government-sponsored enterprise reform and a stronger regulator, is pursuing options "to deal with areas where the market isn't working as well," he said.
