 CHARLOTTE, North Carolina  (Reuters) - Market turmoil only warrants a change in interest rates by the U.S. central bank if it affects the outlook for inflation or growth, Richmond Federal Reserve Bank President Jeffrey Lacker said on Tuesday. 

 But he saw solid reasons to hope that the wild volatility in markets would not have a lasting impact on U.S. growth, while warning that price pressures were a worry. "I believe there are still reasons to remain concerned about the risks to the inflation outlook," said Lacker, one of the Fed's most noted anti-inflation hawks. He acknowledged it was very unclear how the economy, particularly consumer spending, would react to the market meltdown, and stressed he would be watching new data closely. He also laid out strict conditions for any future rate cuts. "Financial market volatility, in and of itself, does not require a change in the target federal funds rate, in my view. Interest rate policy needs to be guided by the outlook for real spending and inflation," he told a business group. "Financial turbulence has the potential to change the assessment of the appropriate rate if it induces a sufficient revision in growth or inflation prospects." Lacker, who was speaking at a Risk Management Association of Charlotte luncheon, dissented four times in policy meetings last year in favor of higher rates while a voter on the Fed's interest rate setting committee. He is not a voter this year. Lacker said he took heart from the stabilization in stock markets since the Fed cut its discount rate on Friday, but it was premature to declare that the move had done its job. "We take actions and financial markets do what they do. I was encouraged by the stabilization of equity markets. Having said that, I don't think equity markets are the locus of concern," he said in response to an audience question. "The locus of concern about the effectiveness and functioning of markets has to do with asset-backed commercial paper related to mortgages, and there I think the jury is out on how the market's reacted to our policy move," he said. The Fed on Friday cut the discount rate, the rate it lends to qualifying banks, by a half percentage point to 5.75 percent as fear over contagion from the problems in the U.S. subprime mortgage market led to a collapse in credit market liquidity. It also noted that market turmoil had the potential to slow growth, while omitting any explicit reference to inflation. This contrasted with the statement after a policy meeting on August 7, when it kept the federal funds rate on hold at 5.25 percent and said inflation was still its main concern. Economists said Friday's statement was a step toward cutting the fed funds' rate at its next policy meeting, scheduled for September 18. However, Lacker cautioned that any move must remain conditional on inflation expectations staying in check. "Federal funds rate adjustments in response to changes in the outlook for inflation and growth should continue to endeavor to stabilize inflation expectations," he said in the speech. He also said that while recent data on core inflation had been encouraging, recent improvements might be transitory and expectations for future inflation were still too high. On the other hand, expectations do not seem to have worsened since market hopes for a Fed rate cut deepened. "A coincident rise in inflation expectations would have raised significant policy concerns," he noted. Lacker agreed there was certainly the risk that market woes could hurt consumer spending by forcing up the cost of credit. He also acknowledged that the fallout from the housing market would probably reduce U.S. growth for the rest of this year. But he did not think market turmoil would curb consumption. Past experience proved consumers could be very resilient, weathering sharp declines in personal wealth provided they continued to believe in their ability to earn in the future, and Lacker said the U.S. labor market as "reasonably tight". "I still expect consumer spending to be reasonably healthy, and for business investment to continue to expand. But I expect overall growth to come in somewhat below its long-term trend for the remainder of the year, based on my expectations that the drag from housing will continue for some time," he said.
