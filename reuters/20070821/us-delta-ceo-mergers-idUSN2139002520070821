 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The incoming chief executive of Delta Air Lines Inc ( DAL.N ) said on Tuesday there were "no plans or intentions" to merge Delta with rival Northwest Airlines Corp NWA.N. 

 Richard Anderson, who was named as Delta's next chief executive earlier on Tuesday, made the comments on a conference call with reporters after being named as the successor to Gerald Grinstein, who retires on September 1. The appointment of Anderson, a former CEO of Northwest, fanned speculation from earlier this year that the two airlines, which emerged from bankruptcy a few months ago, might merge.
