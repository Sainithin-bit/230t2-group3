 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - President George W. Bush on Saturday sought to allay concerns about a $700 billion financial bailout, saying the final cost of the plan would be far less because the price of troubled loans bought by the government would rise over time. 

 Bush said he was confident that legislation being negotiated with Congress over the weekend would be passed "very soon" and there was "widespread agreement" on major principles. "We must free up the flow of credit to consumers and businesses by reducing the risk posed by troubled assets," Bush said in his weekly radio address. "We must ensure that taxpayers are protected, that failed executives do not receive a windfall from your tax dollars, and that there is a bipartisan board to oversee these efforts." He sought to ease anxiety over the high price tag of the legislation. "The final cost of this plan will be far less than $700 billion," Bush said. "Many of the assets the government would buy are likely to go up in price over time. This means that the government will be able to recoup much, if not all, of the original expenditure," he said. Bush repeated his warnings that failure of the financial system would put the economy in danger and on a path toward a "deep and painful recession."
