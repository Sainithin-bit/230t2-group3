 MADRID  (Reuters) - Banco Santander Central Hispano on Saturday declined to comment on a Wall Street Journal report that it was in preliminary talks with U.S. bank Wachovia. 

 Citing unnamed sources familiar with the situation, the Journal said the talks came as Wachovia's shares plummeted 27 percent on Friday amid investors' concerns over its mortgage portfolio. Wachovia is the sixth-largest U.S. bank by assets. At Friday's close, it had a market value of about $21.6 billion while Santander was worth $99.8 billion. Santander is already in the process of buying British mortgage lender Alliance and Leicester for 1.3 billion pounds. The Financial Times on Tuesday reported that the Spanish bank was interested in buying parts of British lender Bradford & Bingley. (Reporting by  Martin Roberts )
