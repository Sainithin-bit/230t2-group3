 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The Senate on Saturday agreed to finance a $25 billion loan package to help troubled automakers as part of a mammoth spending bill that will keep the government running through March 6, 2009. 

 The more than $630 billion spending bill, which passed by a vote of 78 to 12, is needed to keep the government operating after the fiscal year expires on September 30. The U.S. House of Representatives passed the legislation earlier this week and it now heads to the White House for President George W. Bush's signature.
