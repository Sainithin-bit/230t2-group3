 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she hoped congressional negotiators on Saturday would strike a deal on a $700 billion Wall Street bailout plan the White House and lawmakers say is needed to avert an economic collapse. 

 Pelosi, a California Democrat, spoke to reporters as negotiators began talks that according to a congressional aide included Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson. Pelosi said she hoped Congress could act on a bill by Sunday evening or Monday morning. "It would be my hope, that this could be resolved today, that we had a day for the American people and members of Congress to review the legislation on the Internet that we could bring something to the floor possibly Sunday night or Monday morning," Pelosi said. The meeting included top negotiators from the Senate and the House of Representatives as well as a number of committee chairmen. Lawmakers are working against the clock to try to get a deal or even pass legislation before Asian financial markets open on Monday. (Editing by  Peter Cooney )
