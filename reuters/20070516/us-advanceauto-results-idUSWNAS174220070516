 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Retailer Advance Auto Parts Inc. ( AAP.N ) reported on Wednesday a 2.7 percent rise in quarterly earnings and backed its full-year earnings forecast. 

 Net income rose to $76.1 million, or 71 cents per share, in its first quarter ended April 21, from $74.1 million, or 68 cents per share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 5.4 percent to $1.47 billion. Analysts, on average, had expected earnings of 71 cents per share and revenue of $1.49 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. Sales at existing stores, or same-store sales, a key retail measure, rose 1.1 percent in the first quarter. That included a 0.2 percent decrease in sales to retail customers and a 5.2 percent increase in sales to repair shops. The Roanoke, Virginia-based company expects sales at existing stores to grow in the low single-digit range for the second quarter and the year. The No. 2 U.S. auto parts retail chain, behind AutoZone Inc. ( AZO.N ), had 3,150 stores at the end of its first quarter. Earlier in May, Advance Auto Parts said Chief Executive Michael Coppola had resigned effective immediately and lead director John Brouillard had been appointed as interim chairman, president and CEO. Advance Auto Parts expects second-quarter earnings per share of 65 cents to 69 cents, while analysts expect 68 cents. It also backed its 2007 earnings per share forecast range of $2.38 to $2.48, while analysts expect $2.44.
