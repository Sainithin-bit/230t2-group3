 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Factory output picked up in April and groundbreaking on new homes unexpectedly rose, but permits for future home building slid to their lowest level in nearly a decade, signaling ongoing housing sector woes. 

 A Federal Reserve report on Wednesday showed output at U.S. factories, mines and utilities rose a greater-than-expected 0.7 percent in April, with the amount of industrial capacity tapped climbing to 81.6 percent, also above Wall Street forecasts. Commerce Department data showed that while U.S. housing starts rose 2.5 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 1.528 million units, building permits sank to the slowest pace since June 1997. The data offered a mixed picture of the economy's health, but most economists are still expecting tepid growth through the first half of the year as the economy squeezes out of its housing market troubles. "Make no mistake about it, residential investment will take another big bite out of Q2 GDP," said Ken Mayland, economist and president of ClearView Economics in the Cleveland area. U.S. Treasury debt prices ended largely unchanged after the data on housing starts and industrial production did little to alter expectations on Federal Reserve interest rate moves. U.S. stocks ended higher on takeover news, with the Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  gaining 103.69 points, or 0.77 percent, to close at a record 13,487.53. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  added 12.95 points, or 0.86 percent, at 1,514.14, and the Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  gained 22.13 points, or 0.88 percent, to 2,547.42. The dollar rose for the first time in four sessions and hit a three-month high against the yen. HOUSING STARTS UP The rise in housing starts was a surprise, as economists had expected them to slip to a 1.490 million unit pace in April from the 1.518 million rate first reported for March. The government revised down the March figure to 1.491 million. But building permits, which signal future construction plans, dropped in April by 8.9 percent to a pace of 1.429 million units, the slowest in nearly 10 years and well below expectations of 1.525 million units. "This is a half-full, half-empty report because housing starts came in stronger than expected but permits are very weak," said Michael Cheah, portfolio manager at AIG Sunamerica Asset Management in Jersey City, New Jersey. "My inclination is to think the half empty will win, because much weaker permits suggest home builders are looking to retrench home building and that would lead to cutbacks in housing-related jobs," he added. Even though housing starts increased in April to the fastest pace since December 2006, they were down 16 percent from a year ago and, in a sign the troubled housing market may not be turning the corner as quickly as hoped, building permits were off 28.1 percent from a year ago. A separate report on Wednesday showed U.S. mortgage applications fell last week for the first time in four weeks, weighed down by sagging demand for home purchase loans. The Mortgage Bankers Association said its seasonally adjusted index of mortgage application activity, which includes both refinancing and purchasing loans, for the week ended May 11 dipped 0.8 percent. The latest reports lent credence to the pessimistic outlook on Tuesday by the National Association of Home Builders, which reported that home builder sentiment sank in May as lenders made it more difficult for borrowers to qualify for mortgages and order cancellations mounted. INDUSTRIAL OUTPUT UP U.S. industrial production jumped 0.7 percent in April on gains in utilities, auto and high-tech manufacturing output, the Fed report showed. Capacity utilization -- a measure of how close to full capacity factories, mines and utilities are running -- was a slightly greater-than-expected 81.6 percent as manufacturing capacity use picked up. It was above the 1972-2006 average of 81 percent, the Fed said. (Additional reporting by  Mark Felsenthal  in Washington and Julie Haviv in New York)
