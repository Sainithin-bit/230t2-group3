 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Sony Corp. ( 6758.T ) posted a wider quarterly loss on Wednesday due to deficits in its PlayStation game unit, but forecast a sharp rise in annual profit on strong sales of flat-screen TVs and digital cameras. 

 The Japanese electronics and entertainment conglomerate was hit hard last year by massive costs to launch its PlayStation 3 (PS3) game machine, and to recall 9.6 million units of its laptop PC batteries, which in rare cases could catch fire from overheating. But its core electronics division saw its profits improve thanks to a weak yen boosting global sales of its electronics products such as its flagship Bravia TVs and Cyber-shot cameras. Sony's next challenge would be to win back market share in Nintendo Co. Ltd. 7974.OS and Microsoft Corp. ( MSFT.O ) in the $30 billion video game industry. "Investors think highly of Sony's efforts to turn around its struggling electronics business," said Tomomi Yamashita, a fund manager at Shinkin Asset Management. "Now, its game business is underperforming, and whether it can fix that too will be closely watched." The upbeat forecast may also underpin the perception among investors that Sony is on a recovery path, although it is still playing catch-up with Apple ( AAPL.O ) in portable music players and sees tough competition from Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. ( 6752.T ) in flat TVs. Sony forecast operating profit of 440 billion yen ($3.66 billion) for the year to March 2008, a six-fold gain from 2006/7. That beats the consensus of 377.8 billion yen in a poll of 20 analysts by Reuters Estimates, though it includes a 59 billion yen profit from a sale of land not likely reflected in the consensus. Sony expects sales to rise 5.8 percent to 8.78 trillion yen. The earnings outlook also matched an earlier promise made by Howard Stringer, Sony's first non-Japanese chief executive, of achieving 5 percent operating profit margin in 2007/8. NEW GAMES Sony's PlayStation 3 has made a weaker-than-expected showing against Microsoft's Xbox 360 and Nintendo's 7974.OS Wii console since its launch last year. Also due to a part shortage, PS3 made a delayed debut in Europe, where Sony may also cut jobs to shave costs. "It was not an ideal launch," said Sony Senior Vice President Takao Yuhara at a press conference in Tokyo. "Our focus is to strengthen our software lineup this year." Although packed with high-end features such as a high-definition DVD player and cutting edge graphics, the PS3's $600 price tags have left many would-be buyers on the sidelines. Sony said it shipped about 5.5 million PS3 consoles by March 31, of which about 3.6 million were sold. The company aims to nearly double PS3 shipments to 11 million units in 2007/08, but it warned that it would be difficult to bring its game division into the black following an operating loss of 232 billion yen in the past year. It is banking on a better showing for the PlayStation Portable. Shipments of the handheld game player fell 41 percent in 2006/07 amid competition with Nintendo's popular DS device. ELECTRONICS RECOVERY Stringer, who became CEO in 2005, has also pledged to put Sony on the right track by selling non-core assets and focusing on its electronics unit that makes up two-thirds of total sales. The electronics unit's operating profit rose to 157 billion yen in 2006/07 from 7 billion yen in the prior year on robust demand for digital cameras and high-end camcorders. Sony also more than doubled sales of liquid crystal display (LCD) TVs to 6.3 million units and predicted a further surge to 10 million units this year. "We expect profits from TVs to get a boost this year, led by LCDs," Sony Chief Financial Officer Nobuyuki Oneda said. Sony is also starting up an advanced LCD plant with Samsung Electronics Co. ( 005930.KS ) this year, which should help it make its TVs more efficiently. For January-March, the fourth quarter of the past business year, Sony booked an operating loss of 113.4 billion yen, against a loss of 51.9 billion yen a year earlier and the consensus of a 94.5 billion yen loss according to five analysts. Operating profit at Sony came to 71.75 billion yen in the year ended March 31, down from 226.42 billion yen last year. Sales rose 10.5 percent to 8.295 trillion yen, boosted by the strong performance by Sony Ericsson, the world's fourth-largest mobile phone maker owned jointly by Sony and Ericsson ( ERICb.ST ). Prior to the announcement, shares in Sony closed up 1.3 percent at 6,460 yen in Tokyo, having gained about 27 percent since the start of the year. "I think investors will be positive about the results," said Shigemi Nonaka, adviser at Polestar Investment Management. "It would not be strange to see the stock go as high as 7,000 yen."
