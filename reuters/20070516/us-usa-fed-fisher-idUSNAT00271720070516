 FORT WORTH, Texas  (Reuters) - Dallas Federal Reserve Bank President Richard Fisher said on Wednesday that it was necessary to develop better measures for a rapidly growing services sector to accurately assess the economy. 

 "We need to develop better measures for the global economy, particularly as services are increasingly traded," he told a conference. His speech on globalization was broadly similar to one delivered in Houston on April 13.
