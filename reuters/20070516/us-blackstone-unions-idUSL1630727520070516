 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - A major U.S. labor group on Wednesday asked market regulators to force changes to an initial stock offering by Blackstone Group BG.UL, one of the first major U.S. private equity firms to go public. 

 The AFL-CIO urged the Securities and Exchange Commission to require that Blackstone register as an investment company and submit to oversight under the same law mutual funds follow. The labor federation told the SEC in a letter that it believed Blackstone "deliberately structured its public offering ... to hide the fact that the Blackstone Group LP is actually an offering of interests in pools of investment securities." AFL-CIO Secretary-Treasurer Richard Trumka said in a statement: "That's unacceptable, and the SEC should step in and enforce the law." The $4 billion Blackstone initial public offering has been closely watched as one of the first from a large U.S. private equity and hedge fund firm. Blackstone has $78.7 billion under management and has been involved in some of the largest leveraged buyouts ever, including the $23 billion purchase of Sam Zell's Equity Office Properties Trust. The New York firm manages a half-dozen funds that invest in areas that include private equity investing, real estate and distressed debt. In its March prospectus, Blackstone said its listed entity was a partnership exempt from the governance requirements of investment companies such as having a fiduciary duty to stock market investors and keeping a majority of independent directors on the board. The AFL-CIO letter was released ahead of a public hearing in the U.S. House of Representatives on the impact on workers and companies from private equity firms' activities. The SEC and Blackstone declined to comment. (Additional reporting by  Kevin Drawbaugh  in Washington)
