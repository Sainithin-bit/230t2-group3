 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Stocks jumped on Wednesday as major investors disclosed stakes in Citigroup, several railroads and health-care companies, raising expectations that further takeovers could be coming. 

 Shares of Citigroup climbed 4 percent, and were the top driver of the Dow in its 23rd record close this year, after a hedge fund run by Edward Lampert disclosed it owned 15.2 million shares in the largest U.S. bank.  Railroads gained after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. ( BRKa.N ) ( BRKb.N ) said it owns stakes in Union Pacific Corp. ( UNP.N ) and Norfolk Southern Corp. ( NSC.N ), pushing the Dow Jones Transportation Average .DJT up 1.7 percent. While these investments may not necessarily indicate the beginning of a takeover, analysts said they support enthusiasm for shares, boosted in part by a recent flood of takeovers. "We're still riding on a wave of merger mania in a sea of liquidity in the market," said Fred Dickson, market strategist, director of retail research at D.A. Davidson & Co. in Lake Oswego, Oregon. "Traders at this point are afraid to sell. They don't want to be held in a position where the stock they just sold is the next private takeover target. That seems to be the dominant theme," he said. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  gained 103.69 points, or 0.77 percent, to closed at 13,487.53, a new record. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  was up 12.95 points, or 0.86 percent, at 1,514.14. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  was up 22.13 points, or 0.88 percent, at 2,547.42. The Dow also hit an all-time intraday high of 13,489.57 just before the close. The blue-chip average has had multiple records in recent weeks and the S&P 500 is coming off of its sixth straight weeks of gains. After the close, Hewlett-Packard Co. ( HPQ.N ) shares rose 1.3 percent to $45.80 in extended trade after the world's biggest maker of PCs and printers said quarterly net profit fell slightly due to a tax settlement gain a year ago, but excluding that, profits rose 27 percent. <ID:nN16257164> During the regular session, Citigroup stock was the biggest advancer on both the Dow and the S&P 500. It ended at $54.91. Meanwhile, eye-care company Bausch & Lomb Inc. BOL.N said it agreed to be acquired by private equity firm Warburg Pincus for about $3.67 billion. The stock jumped 9.8 percent to $67.50, above the offer price of $65 a share, suggesting shareholders expect a higher bid. Shares of U.S. railroads gained after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. ( BRKa.N ) ( BRKb.N ) disclosed in regulatory filings having stakes in Union Pacific Corp. ( UNP.N ) and Norfolk Southern Corp. ( NSC.N ). Union Pacific shares gained 0.9 percent to $119.39 while Norfolk shares advanced 1.7 percent to $56.79. Berkshire also said it nearly doubled its stake in diversified health-care company Johnson & Johnson ( JNJ.N ) and bought more shares of French drugmaker Sanofi-Aventis SA ( SASY.PA ) in the first quarter. It also disclosed an investment in WellPoint Inc. ( WLP.N ), the largest U.S. health insurer by membership. Johnson & Johnson shares closed up 2 percent at $63.05, while WellPoint rose 1.6 percent to end at $84.86. Trading was active on the NYSE, with about 1.51 billion shares changing hands, below last year's estimated daily average of 1.84 billion, while on Nasdaq, about 2.13 billion shares traded, above last year's daily average of 2.02 billion. Advancing stocks outnumbered declining ones by a ratio of about 5 to 3 on the NYSE and by 17 to 12 on Nasdaq.
