 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Delphi Corp. DPHIQ.PK may be near agreements with the United Auto Workers and former parent General Motors Corp. ( GM.N ) that the auto parts maker needs to exit bankruptcy, a leading industry analyst said on Tuesday. 

 "From what I understand, Delphi is very close to putting the final deal together, that would be in the next week or so," David Cole, chairman of the Center for Automotive Research, said. Delphi spokesman Lindsey Williams declined to comment, saying only that the parts maker remains focused on reaching agreements with its unions. If Delphi does reach agreements with GM and the UAW, it would follow tacit UAW approval of private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management's CBS.UL plans to buy Chrysler. Cerberus is also co-leader of a $3.4 billion equity investment proposal for Delphi. Delphi has been negotiating with its unions and GM since before the bankruptcy, but looming talks between the UAW and the U.S. automakers this summer and a need to complete the reorganization increase the urgency of the situation. Delphi wants to file a reorganization plan by the end of July, but may need to find a replacement for Cerberus in the proposed equity investment and revise its outline for treating creditor claims. The equity investment, and Delphi's plans to divest several business lines, depend on the company reaching agreements with its unions and GM on myriad issues including wages, benefits, work rules, plant closings and long-term customer contracts. Talks have continued despite often-acerbic public comments from UAW President Ron Gettelfinger about Delphi's bankruptcy and the influence of private equity firms on the sector. The UAW also had initially opposed a Chrysler sale to Cerberus. Morningstar analyst John Novak said the UAW appeared to have little choice but to approve of the Cerberus deal for Chrysler, which does not suggest the UAW will make a fundamental shift in its approach to the Delphi negotiations. "They are fighting for what they can on that front and that will likely continue," Novak said of the Delphi talks. Cole said he was not sure the UAW had reached a full detente with Cerberus and Delphi, but union leaders understand jobs and benefit security can only be achieved through agreements with Delphi and the U.S.-based automakers. "This is a really big box right now the industry is in and labor and management have to come up with something that is quite a stretch on what they have done in the past just to give them a chance to stay in the game," Cole said. Delphi plans to cut 21 of 29 U.S. union plants and about four-fifths of its U.S. union work force in the reorganization. It also plans to divest several businesses. The UAW rejected a contract offer from Delphi in March and began holding meetings with its Delphi members in April, a step analysts read as a way for the union to step up the pressure on both Delphi and GM. A labor disruption at Delphi, GM's largest parts supplier, has been viewed as a lingering risk for GM since it has the potential to shut down the automaker's assembly lines and cost billions of dollars. Earlier in May, GM Chief Financial Officer Fritz Henderson said the negotiations were complicated, but the automaker was confident of an eventual resolution.
