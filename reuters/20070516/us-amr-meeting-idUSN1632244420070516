 FORT WORTH, Texas  (Reuters) - AMR Corp. AMR.N is recovering after a years-long downturn in the airline industry, the company's chief executive said on Wednesday, but shareholders say strained labor relations threaten to undo the progress American Airlines' parent has made in recent years. 

 The stockholders, several of whom were AMR employees, pelted Gerard Arpey with criticism over executive compensation for top managers at the parent of the world's largest airline. "I want you to know that your employees feel betrayed," Bobby Gless, a representative of the Transport Workers Union told Arpey at the annual shareholders meeting. Gless was referring to executive stock awards that have driven a wedge between AMR executives and rank-and-file employees, who made steep wage and benefit concessions during a company restructuring. Arpey said managers and workers simply disagree about the fairness of the awards, but he promised to work with the unions to negotiate contracts that workers will find acceptable. "I certainly understand the emotions and views expressed today," Arpey told reporters after the meeting. Arpey's own 2006 compensation amounted to $5.4 million. Another award of $6.64 million will be part of his 2007 compensation. Workers throughout the airline industry have bristled at what they consider to be an unfair gap between their own compensation and that of executives, whose pay is linked largely to company shares. Leaders of top U.S. airlines have seen lucrative stock awards triggered by an industry rebound. One shareholder told Arpey that AMR management has exposed itself as "arrogant, greedy, selfish, thoughtless." Shareholder Patricia Haddon, a former flight attendant, said AMR has lost the trust of its employees. "We wouldn't trust any of you if you told us water is wet," she said. Despite several objections to the amount of executive compensation, shareholders voted down a proposal by the Allied Pilots Association that would have given stock owners more say on the matter. RECOVERY IN PROGRESS Airlines have been battered since 2001 by terrorism concerns, low-fare competition and soaring fuel prices. In 2006, the companies started a recovery, which experts forecast would continue in 2007. The rebound was aided by cost cutting, reductions in excess capacity and a series of revenue-boosting fare increases. Some experts, however, say the failure of several recent attempts by airlines to implement fare rises is a sign domestic travel is slipping. Arpey remained optimistic about revenue. "We are getting some traction on the pricing front," he said. Arpey noted that capacity reductions and higher load factors have improved revenue yield. And he said the airline is constantly on the lookout for cost savings. AMR has set a $300 million saving target for 2007. He said AMR has saved distribution costs by renegotiating booking fees with third party distributors. He also noted increased bookings on American Airlines' Web site aa.com. The company last month swung to an $81 million quarterly profit from a year-ago loss as it filled more seats on planes, charged higher fares and paid less for fuel. AMR shares, which have fallen about 13 percent this year, were up 4.37 percent at $26.49 on the New York Stock Exchange.
