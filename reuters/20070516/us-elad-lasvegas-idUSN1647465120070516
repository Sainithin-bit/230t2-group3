 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The Elad Group, which owns New York's Plaza Hotel, is expected to announce a $5 billion project on the Las Vegas Strip on Wednesday, the Wall Street Journal reported on its Web site. 

 Elad plans to develop a site into a mixed-use development bearing the Plaza name by 2011, the Journal reported. Elad bought the 34.5-acre site, which currently houses the New Frontier Hotel & Casino, for $1.2 billion, the paper said. The new development would come on top of a boom in construction in the largest U.S. gambling market, with casino companies such as MGM Mirage ( MGM.N ) and Boyd Gaming Corp. ( BYD.N ) developing their own multi-billion projects in Las Vegas. An Elad spokesman could not be reached immediately for comment.
