 LONDON  (Reuters) - U.S. oil company Chevron's ( CVX.N ) suspension of non-essential Nigerian offshore operations will last around 30 days because of security concerns, local ship agent Gulf Agency Company (GAC) said on Wednesday. 

 Chevron announced last Friday it was evacuating hundreds of offshore workers, but production would not be further affected. GAC said a statement received from Chevron Nigeria said the oil company had "decided to temporarily suspend all offshore Self Elevating Work Offshore Platforms (SEWOPs) and drilling activities for approximately 30 days, with immediate effect." Citing the statement, GAC said de-manning of all the SEWOPs started on Saturday and was planned to continue through Tuesday, May 15. According to GAC, Chevron had said "the temporary suspension will enable them to concentrate resources and efforts in supporting production operations during these difficult times." Chevron this week restarted production at its 42,000-barrel per day Abiteye oilfield, which is connected to the Escravos export terminal, after a militant attack forced its closure earlier this month. Traders said Escravos shipments for June-loading were delayed by one to three days due to the brief supply disruption.
