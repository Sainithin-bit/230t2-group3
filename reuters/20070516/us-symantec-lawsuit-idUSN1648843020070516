 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Symantec Corp. ( SYMC.O ), maker of the Norton Antivirus software, said on Wednesday it has sued eight companies it accuses of illegally copying its computer security software, seeking more than $55 million in damages. 

 It is the latest company to resort to legal action to fight piracy, a crime the industry says costs software makers billions of dollars a year in lost revenue. Symantec is seeking jury trials in each case and $4 million to $10 million in damages from each company named in the lawsuits, filed in U.S. District Courts in California. Symantec alleges the companies engaged in trademark infringement, copyright infringement, fraud, unfair competition, trafficking in counterfeit labels and documentation, and false advertising. The Cupertino, California-based company is also seeking permanent injunctions banning future sales of the companies' related products and a court order requiring them to turn over existing inventories of the software it says was copied illegally. Software makers lose $11 billion to $12 billion in revenue annually to piracy, according to the Software & Information Industry Association. Symantec's shares gained 4 cents to $19.56 in morning trading on the Nasdaq. (Additional reporting by Jennifer Robin Raj in Bangalore)
