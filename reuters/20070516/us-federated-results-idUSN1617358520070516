 ATLANTA  (Reuters) - Federated Department Stores Inc. FD.N reported lower-than-expected quarterly profit on Wednesday, citing disappointing sales at new Macy's stores, and cut its outlook for the current period on concern about the economy. 

 The retailer said it would step up television advertising and some promotions in an effort to spur store traffic, particularly at former May stores that it converted to the Macy's nameplate. "I think Macy's right now is in no man's land," said Britt Beemer, chairman of America's Research Group, which surveys consumers on spending habits. "They haven't convinced the May Company customers that they are the place to shop." Net income came to $36 million, or 8 cents a diluted share, for the first quarter ended on May 5, compared with a year-earlier loss of $52 million, or 9 cents a share. Excluding merger integration costs, profit from continuing operations increased to 16 cents a share from 1 cent. Analysts on average expected earnings of 19 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Sales fell 0.2 percent to $5.92 billion, below the analysts' average estimate of nearly $6 billion. The company said sales were soft, especially in April, and disappointing at ex-May stores. It also noted continued weakness in sales of home goods. Federated bought May Department Stores in 2005 and converted more than 400 acquired stores, which operated under names such as Foley's and Hecht's, to the Macy's name last year. But sales at those converted stores have been lower than anticipated. "We are going to redirect more of our marketing to public media, which will help drive traffic, particular to former May doors," Chief Financial Officer Karen Hoguet said during a conference call. She added that "promotions will need to create more urgency" for customers to act. The company, which plans to change its name to Macy's Inc., has reported weaker-than-expected sales at stores open at least a year for the past three months, including a 2.2 percent fall for April. BARGAIN SHOPPERS Beemer said the former May customer was more price-driven than the legacy Macy's consumer, and looks for coupons more often. Macy's has reduced coupons it offers and had fewer sales days. "Macy's is learning that the May Company customer that they bought may not want to spend as much money in the store, and Macy's may have to lower some price points," Beemer added. Beemer also said that having mall-based stores could put Macy's at a disadvantage, particularly as department-store rivals such as J.C. Penney Co. ( JCP.N ) and Kohl's Corp. ( KSS.N ) open free-standing stores away from enclosed malls. In a statement, Federated Chairman Terry Lundgren said soft April sales prompted "concern about the consumer and the economic environment," but added that Federated was optimistic that trends would improve later in the year. For the second quarter, Federated forecast profit of 35 cents to 45 cents a share, compared with its previous outlook of 40 cents to 45 cents. It also trimmed its sales estimate to a range of $6 billion to $6.1 billion from an earlier forecast of $6.1 billion to $6.2 billion. Analysts currently expect profit of 46 cents a share, excluding merger integration costs, on sales of $6.1 billion for the quarter, according to Reuters Estimates. For the year, Federated said it still expected earnings of $2.45 to $2.60 a share. Analysts are expecting $2.69. Federated shares eased 12 cents to $39.82 in afternoon New York Stock Exchange trading. The stock has risen 4.4 percent so far this year but is down about 5 percent since Federated posted the April same-store sales drop last week.
