 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Hedge funds should establish a self-regulatory organization and avoid taking money directly from average investors to avert government scrutiny and a possible public backlash, a former head of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said on Wednesday. 

 In remarks to a conference of the New York State Society of CPAs, Harvey Pitt said he believed the estimated $2 trillion hedge fund industry had increased the overall efficiency of capital markets by providing much-needed liquidity. But the funds, which regulators have largely left alone and free to pursue high-risk strategies, could see that change if they move away from courting sophisticated, wealthy investors and try to woo average investors, Pitt said. "Hedge fund investment strategies which involve exposure to arcane, illiquid, or complex financial instruments increase the challenges for investors," Pitt said, citing the difficulty that even sophisticated investors face in learning the true valuations of hedge fund assets. He suggested if firms try to tap average retail investors for funds, or attempt to raise "permanent capital" through public offerings, they may invite regulators' oversight. "I believe that hedge funds that try to raise so-called 'permanent capital' from ordinary investors are embarking upon a course of action that is sure to lead to significant problems," Pitt said. Instead, Pitt, who headed the SEC from 2001 through 2003, suggested U.S. hedge funds develop their own self-regulatory system, that could replicate Britain's hedge fund and private equity supervisory unit known as the Financial Services Authority (FSA). "Regulation of hedge funds is on the horizon," Pitt said. "The only question is whether that regulation will come from the government or from hedge funds themselves." As Pitt sees it, hedge funds are facing three major obstacles: the need to generate higher returns, raise additional funds and manage the greater attention they are gaining from regulators and the market. He said he admired Britain's FSA, for unveiling plans in March to widen retail investors' access to hedge funds through the use of Funds of Alternative Investment Funds. That type of structure gives regulators comfort that average investors are protected, gives hedge funds access to permanent capital and allows retail investors to benefit from typically strong hedge fund returns, Pitt said. "If the hedge fund industry is able to realize that the benefits of self-regulation outweigh their costs, for a few dollars more the industry can protect itself from unwelcome government intervention," Pitt said. "Absent any concrete suggestions from hedge funds ... legislators and regulators will be happy to propose their own solutions, no matter how impractical," Pitt added. Some lawmakers have been pushing for more scrutiny of hedge funds, arguing that the average investor has become more vulnerable to hedge funds because many pension funds now invest in them. Just this week, Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa introduced legislation that, if approved, would require hedge funds to register with the SEC. The SEC had proposed a similar rule last year, but the U.S. Appeals Court for the District of Columbia threw it out. Late last year the SEC also proposed making individual investors show they are worth at least $2.5 million, up from $1 million, in order to invest in hedge funds. Some hedge fund managers, like Jim Chanos of Kynikos Associates, have said the industry should be more proactive in addressing regulatory and legislative concern about hedge funds. Pitt now runs a Washington-based corporate governance consulting firm, Kalorama Partners. He declined to reveal his client list, but said he represents and advises some hedge funds.
