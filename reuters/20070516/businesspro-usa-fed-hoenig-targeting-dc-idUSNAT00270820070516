 DENVER  (Reuters) - Kansas City Federal Reserve President 
Thomas Hoenig said on Tuesday that any decision on whether to 
adopt formal inflation targets is "still a ways off." 

  There needs to be a lot more discussion within the Fed and 
among the academic community on the topic of targets, Hoenig 
told local business leaders while answering questions after a 
speech.  Hoenig, a voting member of the Federal Open Market 
Committee this year, said targeting was just one of a number of 
options that the Fed will consider to improve its 
communications about policy matters.  Hoenig also repeated the central bank's commitment to low 
and stable prices. "Historically, an economy that has an 
environment of stable prices functions better over time," he 
said.
