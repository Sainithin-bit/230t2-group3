 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. mortgage applications fell for the first time in four weeks, weighed down by sagging demand for home purchase loans, an industry group said on Wednesday. 

 The Mortgage Bankers Association said its seasonally adjusted index of mortgage application activity, which includes both refinancing and purchasing loans, for the week ended May 11 dipped 0.8 percent to 675.5. The four-week moving average of mortgage applications, which smoothes the volatile weekly figures, was up 1.7 percent. Borrowing costs on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages, excluding fees, averaged 6.13 percent, up 0.03 percentage point from the previous week. Interest rates, however, were significantly below year-ago levels of 6.66 percent. The MBA's seasonally adjusted purchase index, widely considered a timely gauge of U.S. home sales, fell 1.4 percent to 432.3 after hitting 438.3 the previous week, which was its highest level since the week ended January 12 when it stood at 439.7. The index, however, was above its year-ago level of 426.7. The group's seasonally adjusted index of refinancing applications rose slightly to 2,115.5 from 2,115.2 in the prior week. A year earlier the index stood at 1,546.8. The refinance share of applications increased to 42.1 percent from 41.8 percent the previous week. Fixed 15-year mortgage rates averaged 5.81 percent, down from 5.82 percent. Rates on one-year adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) decreased to 5.61 percent from 5.71 percent. The ARM share of activity decreased to 17.4 percent from 18 percent in the previous week. U.S. housing industry indexes, in general, tend to be volatile and have recently painted a mixed picture, with some pointing to weakening and others to stabilization in the hard-hit sector. The MBA's survey covers about 50 percent of all U.S. retail residential loans. Respondents include mortgage banks, commercial banks and thrifts.
