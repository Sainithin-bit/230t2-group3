 LONDON  (Reuters) - AstraZeneca Plc ( AZN.L ) expressed confidence on Wednesday that its $15.6 billion acquisition of MedImmune Inc. MEDI.O would go ahead, despite a lawsuit contesting the deal from an investor in the U.S. biotechnology company. 

 Chris Larson of San Diego filed a lawsuit against MedImmune and its senior officers and directors, claiming the sale benefited them more than ordinary shareholders. "This is a matter for MedImmune as AstraZeneca is not party to the suit. However, MedImmune's SEC filing states that it does not believe the suit has any merit. Therefore we are confident that the deal will go ahead," an AstraZeneca spokesman said. Larson filed his suit seeking class-action status for fellow MedImmune shareholders in a Montgomery County, Maryland, court on April 25 -- two days after the deal was announced. The suit was disclosed by MedImmune in a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing only this week. His claim argues that MedImmune insiders "will reap disproportionate benefits to the exclusion of maximizing stockholder value." His lawsuit states: "Instead of attempting to obtain the highest value reasonably available for the company's stockholders, defendants spent a substantial effort tailoring the acquisition to meet the specific needs of AstraZeneca." Defendants in the lawsuit include MedImmune Chief Executive and President David Mott and founder and Chairman Wayne Hockmeyer, both of whom stand to receive substantial payouts from the sale. Larson asked the court to stop the merger unless and until MedImmune takes steps to ensure the highest possible value for shareholders. However David Katz, chief investment officer for Matrix Asset Management, which holds about 1.8 million MedImmune shares, said Larson was just trying to be thorn in the side of the deal getting done and out to make some money for himself. "Our sense is this is a frivolous annoyance suit and while we're not ecstatic about the compensation package that management got, clearly they did the right thing by shareholders and the $58 price is a very health price," said Katz, who for months before the deal had publicly agitated for a sale of the company. "MedImmune shareholders are very pleased with the price," Katz added. AstraZeneca won the bidding for MedImmune after a competitive auction. Many analysts say it will be overpaying if the deal goes through. In its final negotiations, AstraZeneca increased its offer to $58 a share from a nonbinding $50 on April 5, according to SEC filings. The all-cash purchase of MedImmune is the biggest transaction since the creation of the Anglo-Swedish drugs group in 1999 and will take AstraZeneca deeper into biotech medicine. AstraZeneca said last month it hoped to close the deal in June. (Additional reporting by  Bill Berkrot  in New York)
