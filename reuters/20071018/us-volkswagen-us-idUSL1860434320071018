 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Volkswagen ( VOWG.DE ) plans to prices its vehicles in the U.S. market more aggressively and drop costly features many customers there don't want, Chief Executive Martin Winterkorn was quoted as saying. 

 The idea is to narrow the sales gap that separates Europe's biggest carmaker from larger rival Toyota Motor Corp ( 7203.T ) of Japan, the Wall Street Journal Europe reported. "We have definitely added too many technical items that (American) customers don't want to pay for," Winterkorn said. By tailoring its cars more to U.S. tastes, he said, it could offer future versions of its Jetta and Passat models below what they sell for now. The Jetta starts at about $17,000 in the U.S. market, while the Passat starts for roughly $23,900. Toyota's Corolla is priced about $15,200, while the larger Camry starts at about $20,000, the paper said.
