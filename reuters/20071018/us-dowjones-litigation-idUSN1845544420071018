 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Dow Jones & Co Inc DJ.N has agreed to settle an investor lawsuit that accused the company's directors of failing to properly evaluate News Corp's NWSa.N takeover bid, it said in a U.S. regulatory filing this week. 

 In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing late Wednesday, Dow Jones said it has agreed to pay $895,000 to cover legal costs for the plaintiffs in the case, and make additional disclosures in the filing about the company's internal forecasts. Earlier this year, News Corp sealed a $5.6 billion deal to buy Dow Jones, the publisher of The Wall Street Journal. But the suit, which had been seeking class-action status, claimed Dow's directors had failed to do their fiduciary duty by not disclosing conflicts of interest and either scaring off or not pursuing other competitive bids for the company. The suit also claimed that Dow's September filing about the merger did not disclose management's projections and forecasts for the company. The plaintiffs argued those forecasts would signal management's true opinion of the value of the company. According to the filing, Dow internally projects earnings of $1.50 per share excluding special items for 2007, $1.95 per share in 2008 and $2.25 per share in 2009. The suit was originally filed in May as two separate shareholder suits by Carol Cresh and Nora Vides, but the suits were consolidated in New York State Supreme Court in July, according to the filing. The settlement was reached "in principle" on Tuesday and Dow has agreed to pay the plaintiffs' fees within 10 business days of the settlement becoming effective, according to the filing. The settlement must receive court approval. Reuters competes with Dow Jones in providing financial news and data. (Reporting by  Emily Chasan , editing by Brian Moss)
