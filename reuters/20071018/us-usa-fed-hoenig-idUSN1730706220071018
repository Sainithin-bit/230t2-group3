 TULSA, Oklahoma  (Reuters) - Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City President Thomas Hoenig on Wednesday said he was keeping an open mind about the future direction of interest rates but was on alert for fallout from financial market woes. 

 "Wait and see," he cautioned an audience at a dinner hosted by the Kansas City Fed. "I'm optimistic, but I am also realistic and I want to stay alert as we move through this tender time," he said in response to a question after delivering his outlook for the economy. Hoenig is a voting member of the Fed's interest rate-setting committee this year, which is scheduled to next meet on October 30-31 to review its policy stance. Investors are split on whether the Fed will ease borrowing costs again following its bold half-point cut, to 4.75 percent, on September 18 to shield growth from a slumping housing market which sparked a global credit crunch in August. He said the Fed's policy actions had helped stabilize conditions, but there are "still vulnerabilities out there," while economic growth had slowed to around a 2 percent pace. Hoenig said the weaker housing market had had a direct impact on the construction industry, and sectors like furniture sales. Cooling housing prices have also had an impact on the so-called wealth effect on consumer spending. Together, these have brought U.S. economic growth to a level below its long-run potential, he said. At the same time, however, there were some offsets like stronger demand for U.S. exports thanks to a weaker dollar, while "inflation has actually slowed," he said.
