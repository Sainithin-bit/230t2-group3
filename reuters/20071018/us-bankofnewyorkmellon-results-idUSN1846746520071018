 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Bank of New York Mellon Corp ( BK.N ) said on Thursday third-quarter profit rose 11 percent, topping analysts' forecasts, helped by growth in fees from asset management and providing back-office services to institutional clients. 

 In the first quarter since the July merger of Bank of New York Co. with Mellon Financial Corp., net income totaled $640 million, up from $574 million a year earlier for the separate companies, on a pro forma basis, the bank said. Bank of New York alone posted a $352 million profit a year earlier. Earnings per share totaled 56 cents per share. Profit from continuing operations was $642 million, also equal to 56 cents per share. Profit totaled 67 cents per share excluding merger expenses, and 73 cents per share including several other items, the bank said. Analysts on average expected profit of 62 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue rose 25 percent on a pro forma basis to $3.6 billion, topping the average $3.49 billion forecast. Chief Executive Robert Kelly said the combined company boosted profit and revenue at a double-digit pace despite a "volatile" market environment. Rival custody banks also posted higher profits this week. Profit rose 27 percent at Chicago's Northern Trust Corp ( NTRS.O ) and 29 percent at Boston's State Street Corp ( STT.N ). At JPMorgan Chase & Co ( JPM.N ), a large custodian better known for retail and investment banking, profit rose 2 percent. Shares of Bank of New York Mellon closed Wednesday at $43.96 on the New York Stock Exchange. FEES RISE Bank of New York's $18.3 billion purchase of Pittsburgh-based Mellon created the world's largest provider of custody services for institutional investors, now handling $20.8 trillion of assets, and a large asset manager now overseeing $1.11 trillion. Bank of New York's business was weighted toward securities servicing, which consists of holding securities and processing trades for institutional investors. Mellon's was weighted toward asset management, including the Dreyfus mutual funds. Fees from securities servicing totaled $1.46 billion, up 31 percent from $1.11 billion at the former Bank of New York and Mellon combined. Asset and wealth management fees rose 25 percent to $854 million. Founded in 1784 by Alexander Hamilton, Bank of New York is the oldest U.S. banking company. Mellon was founded in 1869, and grew to prominence under financier Andrew Mellon. Both companies quit branch banking this decade. Bank of New York Mellon ended September with $184 billion of assets.
