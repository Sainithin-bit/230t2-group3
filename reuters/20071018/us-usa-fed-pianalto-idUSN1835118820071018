 COLUMBUS, Ohio  (Reuters) - Cleveland Federal Reserve Bank President Sandra Pianalto said on Thursday that except for a weak housing sector, the rest of the U.S. economy was performing relatively well. 

 "The housing sector has remained very weak, but output and employment in other sectors appears to be holding up," Pianalto told the Ohio Grantmakers Forum annual conference. She also said that both inflation and inflation expectations "continue to be moderate and well anchored." The Fed focuses tightly on inflation in setting interest rates. Pianalto said that since Fed policy-makers last met on September 18 and decided to lower interest rates, some of the pressures that were so apparent in financial markets have eased. "The strains in financial markets that were so evident and worrisome in mid-September appear to have lessened somewhat," she said, adding that markets now seemed to gain stability as people gained more understanding of their financial exposure. In a response to a question from an audience member, Pianalto indicated that she was uncertain whether more stimulus in the form of additional interest-rate cuts are needed. "The uncertainty around the outlook today is very high," she said. "It's not clear how the financial market disruptions that we've seen are going to affect economic growth in future so this is a period of time when we are waiting and learning." A crisis in subprime mortgage markets, where less credit-worthy borrowers have begun to experience rising foreclosures, has sent tremors throughout financial markets as participants strive to determine who holds vulnerable loans, many of which were packaged and sold to investors as securities. Much of Pianalto's address dealt with the Ohio regional economy, where many manufacturing businesses are located, rather than national economic conditions. She said Ohio faced the same problems as the rest of the economy with the added difficulty of being challenged by long-term structural issues as the requirement for workers to become more highly skilled increases. Ohio's work force has become "less dynamic than the nation as a whole," Pianalto said, creating fewer jobs and with lower rates of income growth because it is not adding the type of high-skilled jobs that will be necessary for future growth.
