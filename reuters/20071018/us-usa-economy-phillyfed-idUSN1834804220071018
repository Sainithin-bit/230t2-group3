 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Factory activity in the U.S. Mid-Atlantic region grew more weakly than expected in October, with lower new orders and a jump in prices paid, a survey showed on Thursday. 

 The Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank said its business activity index was at 6.8 in October versus 10.9 in September. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a reading of 7.3. Any reading above zero indicates growth in the region's manufacturing sector. The survey covers factories in a region encompassing eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey and Delaware. U.S. stock markets  .DJI   .IXIC   .SPX  traded steady at lower levels, while U.S. Treasury debt prices US10YT=RR extended gains following the release of the data. The Philadelphia Fed's new orders index fell to 2.7 in October, the lowest since March, from 15.1 in September. The prices paid index jumped to 40.3, the highest since August 2006, from 23.1 in September. At the same time, the employment index rose to 12.6 in October from 7.5 in September. The six-month business conditions outlook rose to 41.5 from 35.7 in September, while the six-month capital expenditures outlook eased to 20.5 from 21.3 last month.
