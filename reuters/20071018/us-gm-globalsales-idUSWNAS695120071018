 DETROIT  (Reuters) - General Motors Corp ( GM.N ) said on Thursday its global sales rose 4 percent in the third quarter, but said U.S. sales would be subdued in the fourth quarter and would be flat next year. 

 GM's global sales rose to a record 2.38 million vehicles in the third quarter of 2007, but sales in North America -- its largest market -- fell 6 percent. GM cited softness in demand due to a weak economy, and pressure in the U.S. housing market in its outlook for lower sales in the United States -- the dominant market in North America. "As we assess those conditions in the U.S., fourth quarter and heading into 2008, it appears that growth will remain subdued," GM's chief sales analyst Paul Ballew said on a conference call, Ballew said he expected U.S. sales to be "flat" in 2008, even as global sales are expected to rise by about 2 million units. Looking at an industry sales forecast for light vehicles in 2008, Ballew said he expects them to come in at 16 million units. That forecast is lower than Ford Motor Co's ( F.N ) expectations. Ford's Chief Executive Alan Mulally said earlier this week he expects U.S. light vehicle sales between 16.3 million and 16.5 million units in 2008. Most analysts expect U.S. auto sales in 2007 to come in between 16 million and 16.1 million vehicles in 2007, which would be the worst performance since 1998, when the tally was 15.69 million units. GLOBAL GROWTH In the third quarter, GM's sales in Latin America, Africa and the Middle East rose 22 percent, while sales in the Asia-Pacific region rose 16 percent, the company said. The largest U.S. automaker also posted a 15 percent sales increase in Europe during the third quarter. GM's third-quarter sales outside the United States accounted for about 56 percent of total sales, up 14 percent from a year earlier. GM's Chief Executive Rick Wagoner has said he expects sales outside the United States to continue surpassing domestic sales in the next few years. The overseas growth comes at a time when GM has agreed to job guarantees in the United States by outlining future product commitment on a plant-by-plant basis in a four-year labor contract reached with the United Auto Workers union late last month. GM, which lost more than $12 billion in the past two years, is in the middle of a sweeping restructuring that includes slashing more than 34,000 jobs and closing 12 plants in North America. GM shares were up 7 cents to $38.75, and Ford shares rose 11 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $8.80 in late morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
