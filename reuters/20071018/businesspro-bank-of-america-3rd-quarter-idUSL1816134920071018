 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Bank of America Corp ( BAC.N ), the 
second-largest U.S. bank, on Thursday said third-quarter profit 
fell 32 percent, hurt by the impact of volatile capital and 
credit markets on its investment banking unit. 

  Net income fell to $3.7 billion, or 82 cents per share, 
from $5.42 billion, or $1.18, a year earlier.  Results included a $1.33 billion decline in earnings from 
corporate and investment banking.  (Reporting by Jonathan Stempel)
