 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. stocks were little changed on Thursday, as optimism about technology profits helped cancel out worries about how much the credit crunch has hurt the economy, after disappointing earnings from Bank of America. 

 Technology stocks once again outperformed the broader market, pushing the Nasdaq higher, as investors bet Google Inc. ( GOOG.O ) and Advanced Micro Devices ( AMD.N ) would post strong earnings after the bell, following healthy results from rivals. According to the latest available data, the Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  was down 4.72 points, or 0.03 percent, to end unofficially at 13,887.82. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  was down 1.32 points, or 0.09 percent, at 1,539.92. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  was up 6.64 points, or 0.24 percent, at 2,799.31.
