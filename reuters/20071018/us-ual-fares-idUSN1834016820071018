 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - UAL Corp UAUA.O, parent of United Airlines, on Thursday said it raised domestic fares to offset high fuel costs, a move that was matched by at least two major carriers. 

 A spokeswoman for the No. 2 U.S. airline said it increased fares on Wednesday night by as much as $10 round-trip for domestic flights of less than 1,500 miles and by up to $20 on round-trip domestic flights longer than 1,500 miles. The increase includes some -- but not all -- markets where UAL faces low-fare competition. She said the increase will help offset the high cost of jet fuel. Continental Airlines Inc CAL.N and Delta Air Lines Inc ( DAL.N ) said they matched the fare hike, with some exceptions. AMR Corp AMR.N, parent of American Airlines, said it was studying the increase. Carriers can raise fares at set times during the day. When a fare increase fails to win broad support, it usually will fail. "I expect the legacy airlines to begin competitive matching immediately, and most likely a strategic match as well as the day unfolds," said Rick Seaney, chief executive of fare tracker FareCompare.com. The airline industry has been raising fares to offset the high cost of fuel, which is directly related to the price of crude oil. New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures CLc1 notched a record high of $89 a barrel on Wednesday. (Reporting by Kyle Peterson, editing by Gerald E. McCormick)
