 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Billionaire investor Warren Buffett denied rumors on Thursday that Berkshire Hathaway Inc ( BRKa.N ) was interested in buying a stake in struggling investment bank Bear Stearns Cos Inc BSC.N. 

 Buffett made his comments during an interview on Fox Business News. After two of its hedge funds collapsed this summer, Bear Stearns became the subject of speculation about whether or not it would take on a large equity investor. Earlier this month, Bear Stearns Chairman Jimmy Cayne said the company would consider selling a stake to an investor from China or the Middle East. Bear Stearns' presence outside the United States lags larger rivals. A Chinese official from CITIC Bank Corp Ltd ( 0998.HK ) ( 601939.SS ) recently said CITIC would like to acquire a piece of Bear Stearns, the smallest of Wall Street's five big independent brokerages.
