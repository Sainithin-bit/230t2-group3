 HELSINKI  (Reuters) - The world's top cellphone maker Nokia ( NOK1V.HE ) said on Thursday levels of unsold handsets in the sales channel for the industry were on the normal level. 

 "There is nothing abnormal here at the moment when it comes to channel, channel is quite normal," Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo told Reuters in an interview. Earlier, Nokia reported forecast-beating third-quarter results boosted by robust demand for new cheaper phones on emerging markets, sending its shares higher. Nokia has been benefiting from good demand for its cheap and pricey models, but analysts have outpointed the firm is under pressure in the mid-priced segment from rivals such as Samsung Electronics ( 005930.KS ) and Sony Ericsson ( 6758.T ) ( ERICb.ST ). Kallasvuo said the company' heavy investments there had started to pay off. "We have been investing in that part of the market really extensively. In comparison to what we had one year ago, I think we're more competitive in the mid-end than one year ago," he said.  (Additional reporting by  Sakari Suoninen  and  Agnieszka Flak )
