 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Southwest Airlines Co ( LUV.N ) and Continental Airlines Inc CAL.N, two of the largest U.S. carriers, posted higher quarterly earnings on Thursday as fuller planes and fare increases helped offset soaring fuel costs. 

 The results from Southwest and Continental are the latest signs that the U.S. airline industry's recovery from a long slump remains on track despite a slowing U.S. economy. Earlier this week, American Airlines parent AMR Corp AMR.N and Delta Air Lines Inc ( DAL.N ) posted better-than-expected earnings, benefiting from tighter cost controls and lower capacity in the United States. But the companies were facing easy comparisons with the year-earlier period, when a security scare kept travelers home and weakened airline profits. Meanwhile, rising oil prices and the softer U.S. market could yet stall the recovery. "We are concerned about the slow domestic demand this year," Southwest Chief Executive Gary Kelly told Reuters. Southwest was behind in its revenue plan by several hundred million dollars this year because of weak demand, he said, and the company was prepared to slow its expansion further if necessary. "We all know what's going on in the economy, so we have to keep on our toes about our growth plan for next year," Kelly said. For its part, Continental is stepping up efforts to conserve fuel and cut costs. "There is a tremendous focus on every gallon of fuel we can save," Chief Executive Larry Kellner said on a conference call. "If things get worse, we'll continue to take actions to make sure we manage the business well." The dour outlook and surging oil prices sent airline shares lower. The Amex airline index  .XAL  was down 2 percent in afternoon trading. Continental shares fell nearly 4 percent, and Southwest dipped 1.4 percent. SOUTHWEST PROFIT SURGES Third-quarter earnings at Southwest, the leading U.S. low-cost carrier, tripled as more flights and fuller planes boosted revenue. The carrier, which is well hedged against rising fuel prices, posted net profit of $162 million, or 22 cents per share, compared with $48 million, or 6 cents per share, a year earlier. The company said it had taken charges of 2 cents per share for an employee buyout program and 1 cent for a change in Illinois state income tax law. Excluding the charges and gains and losses on the fuel hedging position, Southwest's earnings were in line with Wall Street expectations of 21 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Operating revenue rose 10.5 percent to $2.59 billion, helped by an 8.1 percent increase in capacity and fuller planes. Southwest, the largest U.S. carrier by market value, has slowed its expansion plans and is gearing up to launch new business efforts that may include in-flight Internet service and the sale of hotel rooms on its Web site. In the latest quarter, Southwest booked gains of $189 million from its fuel-hedging program, which is gradually unwinding, reducing its fuel-cost advantage over other carriers. In the same quarter last year, the company had a fuel-hedging gain of $200 million. CONTINENTAL GETS TRANS-ATLANTIC LIFT Continental's third-quarter earnings rose 2 percent, boosted by higher fares and more international flights. The No. 4 U.S. carrier posted net profit of $241 million, compared with $237 million a year earlier. Diluted per-share earnings, however, fell to $2.15 from $2.17 because of a higher share count this year. Excluding a $12 million charge for a settlement involving a pilot pension plan, Continental said it had earned $2.25 per share, beating the average Wall Street forecast of $2.13, according to Reuters Estimates. Operating revenue rose 8.6 percent to $3.82 billion, boosted by a 22 percent jump in trans-Atlantic passenger revenue. The U.S. market, however, was much softer. Domestic passenger revenue for Continental's mainline fleet rose 7.3 percent, while regional passenger revenue fell 4.5 percent. Continental plans to continue its focus on international markets next year. It expects to increase overall capacity by 3 percent to 4 percent in 2008, with domestic growing by less than 1 percent. But trans-Atlantic competition is due to increase next year when the Open Skies agreement between the U.S. and the European Union takes effect, potentially souring prospects for those routes. "The international market is stronger this year, but as soon as it becomes strong, it's going to become weak," said Southwest's Kelly. "There's no safe haven in this industry." Continental, like other carriers, remains exposed to soaring fuel costs, which vies with labor as the industry's largest expense. "The high cost of fuel continues to pose challenges for us, but we'll keep working those costs we can control," Chief Financial Officer Jeff Misner said in a statement. Continental said it was close to finalizing efforts to reduce supplier and other costs, moves it expects to lead to annual savings of about $100 million. In afternoon New York Stock Exchange trade, Continental shares were down $1.32, or 3.6 percent, at $34.91, while Southwest fell 20 cents to $14.36.
