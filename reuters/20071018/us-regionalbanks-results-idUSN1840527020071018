 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. regional banks SunTrust Banks Inc ( STI.N ), BB&T Corp ( BBT.N ) and First Horizon National Corp ( FHN.N ) on Thursday posted earnings below analysts' forecasts, as a slowing economy and housing market caused increases in bad loans. 

 Profit fell 23 percent at SunTrust and rose 6 percent at BB&T, while First Horizon posted a loss. All three operate mainly in the U.S. southeast. Operating profit rose 23 percent at PNC Financial Services Group Inc ( PNC.N ), which operates in the mid-Atlantic, though net income fell 73 percent because of a large one-time gain a year earlier. Earnings fell 12 percent at Ohio's Huntington Bancshares Inc ( HBAN.O ). Results at both topped forecasts. "We're in the midst of a worsening credit cycle," said Chris Hagedorn, who helps invest $22.4 billion at Fifth Third Asset Management in Cincinnati. "Banks will need to keep building reserves, which hinders earnings." Regional banks are struggling along with larger rivals. Bank of America Corp ( BAC.N ), the No. 2 U.S. bank, on Thursday posted a 32 percent drop in quarterly profit, three days after No. 1 Citigroup Inc ( C.N ) said profit slid 57 percent. Earnings slumped 72 percent at Washington Mutual Inc ( WM.N ), the nation's largest thrift said on Wednesday. Atlanta-based SunTrust said third-quarter profit totaled $412.6 million, or $1.18 per share. Excluding items, profit was $1.26 per share, 2 cents below the average analyst forecast, according to Reuters Estimates. Results included $161 million of writedowns for loan and trading assets. The amount set aside for loan losses more than doubled to $147 million. SunTrust said it may pursue more restructuring after in August setting 2,400 job cuts. BB&T, based in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, said profit totaled $444 million, or 80 cents per share. Excluding items, profit was 81 cents per share, 3 cents below the average forecast. Credit losses rose 69 percent to $109 million. Memphis, Tennessee-based First Horizon lost $14.2 million, or 11 cents per share. Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co analysts estimated operating profit at 7 cents per share, excluding a cost-cutting program. Analysts on average expected profit of 27 cents per share. Bad loans rose 83 percent. Operating profit at Pittsburgh-based PNC was $469 million, or $1.37 per share, two cents per share ahead of forecasts. Fees rose 24 percent, helped by brokerage and asset management gains and the purchase of Baltimore's Mercantile Bankshares Corp. Columbus, Ohio-based Huntington said profit fell to $138.2 million, or 38 cents per share, reflecting costs to buy Sky Financial Group Inc. Excluding items, profit was 47 cents per share, four cents ahead of forecasts. In afternoon trading, SunTrust shares rose $1.89 to $73.64; BB&T fell $1.07 to $37.49; First Horizon fell $1.14 to $23.90; PNC surged $3.30 to $70.57, and Huntington rose 12 cents to $17.08. The Philadelphia KBW Bank Index .BKX and KBW Regional Bank Index .KRX fell a respective 1 percent and 1.6 percent. (Additional reporting by  Anupreeta Das ,  Joseph A.
