 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc ( WMT.N ) said on Thursday it was cutting prices on 15,000 more items this week as the world's largest retailer tries to boost sales heading into the crucial holiday shopping season. 

 The latest price cuts follow a move on September 30 to reduce prices on hot holiday toys. It has now reduced prices on 20 percent more items than at this point a year ago. Wal-Mart has said it intends to be very aggressive this holiday season. It is trying to woo shoppers back into its stores and re-emphasize low prices after efforts last year to sell more upscale goods backfired with its core lower-income shoppers. But this year, those core shoppers are being squeezed by higher food and fuel costs, and the slowdown in the housing market. Toys sales have also been hit by a rash of recalls that have raised questions about the safety of toys on store shelves. Last week, Wal-Mart reported September sales at its U.S. stores open at least a year that rose 1.4 percent, missing Wall Street expectations for a 1.9 percent rise, and it forecast October U.S. same-store sales would be flat to up 2 percent. But it raised its third-quarter earnings view, aided by cost cuts. The new round of price cuts extend beyond toys into food, home and apparel items. For instance, Wal-Mart said it cut the price on a Black & Decker 12-cup digital coffee maker to $24.96 from $29.92, while it reduced the price on a GE microwave to $59.96 from $64.72. Wal-Mart said more savings in electronics, home, food and toys will be announced in the coming days. (Reporting by  Nicole Maestri )
