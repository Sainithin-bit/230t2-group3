 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Logitech LOGN.VX ( LOGI.O ), the world's largest maker of computer mice, on Wednesday announced a management shake-up and said it would likely take an impairment loss to account for the trouble in the credit markets. 

 The company, which said it would report its full quarterly results in three weeks, posted second-quarter sales of $595 million, up 19 percent. Operating income rose 54 percent to $80.4 million. In the meantime it said that as part of a shift in management, Logitech co-founder Daniel Borel would step down from his role as chairman. Borel will be replaced by Guerrino De Luca. Gerald Quindlen, the senior vice president of worldwide sales and marketing, will become Logitech's president and chief executive officer. The company said it delayed its full results while it reviews the fair value of its short-term investments, which consist of structured finance instruments, with a par value of $169 million, composed of corporate debt as well as collateralized debt obligations. In a statement, Logitech said it "believes there has been significant impairment in the value of its short-term investment portfolio due to the recent dislocations in the credit markets." It added that it will likely record an impairment loss of between $55 million and $75 million. After the quarter ended, however, it sold 50 percent of each of the securities in the portfolio and will recover half of the loss. That will be reported as a gain on the third-quarter income statement. "It is very unfortunate that due to unauthorized actions and misrepresentations to management, Logitech has been affected by the current dislocations in the credit markets," Chief Financial Officer Mark Hawkins said in a statement. "Since uncovering the facts in early October, we've taken aggressive and swift action to address this isolated incident and prevent the recurrence of a similar situation," he added. As for the second quarter, retail sales grew 16 percent, helped by strong demand for Harmony remote controls, audio products, and keyboards and desktops. The company confirmed its sales target of 15 percent growth and increased its year-on-year operating income growth goal from 15 percent to 20 percent for the current fiscal year. It said in fiscal year 2008, the gross margin should be above the high end of the its long-term target range of 32-34 percent.
