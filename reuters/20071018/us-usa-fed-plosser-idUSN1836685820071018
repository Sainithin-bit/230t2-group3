 ST. LOUIS  (Reuters) - Central banks can communicate better by adopting policy rules of thumb to guide their actions, Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia President Charles Plosser said on Thursday. 

 "Simple rules may be useful, and could be useful in communication, in communicating key aspects about policy," Plosser told a conference sponsored by the St Louis Fed on monetary policy-making under uncertainty. "Behavior governed by simple rules is easier to monitor, it is easier to communicate and I think this contributes to an open and transparent way of conducting monetary policy," Plosser told the conference, being held to honor St Louis Fed President William Poole, who retires next year. The Fed is currently examining whether adopting an explicit inflation target would help it ensure low and stable prices while pursuing maximum sustainable employment, its dual mandate.
