 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Bank of America Corp ( BAC.N ) on Thursday said it expects to make changes within its investment banking business and said its outlook for the first half of 2008 in that business is less robust than for the first half of 2007. 

 Chief Executive Kenneth Lewis, on a conference call, said he suspects 2008 investment banking revenue may come in between 2005 and 2006 levels. The outlook for investment banking markets is expected to be less robust in the first half of 2008, compared with the first half of this year, he added. "What I can't say is that we stay the course and go forward as we have in the past," Lewis said. He said there was a "very high" probability that its investment banking division will undergo some changes, including elimination of some businesses and infrastructure.
