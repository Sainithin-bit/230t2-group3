 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A Genentech Inc DNA.N investor filed a lawsuit on Wednesday over the proposed $43.7 billion buyout by majority shareholder Roche Holding AG ( ROG.VX ), saying the bid is unfair and inadequate. 

 The suit, brought in Delaware Chancery Court, seeks to block the Swiss drugmaker's bid from going forward under its current terms. Roche has offered to buy all outstanding shares in Genentech, its U.S. partner, for $89 a share in cash to solidity its position in cancer medicines. "It is clear that the proposed buyout is on unfair terms and shortchanges Genentech's shareholders," Steven Toll, a lawyer for the plaintiff, said in a statement. Plaintiff Ira Gaines is an individual investor who holds Genentech stock, Toll said. The lawsuit contends Roche's bid was timed to capitalize on general market turmoil and a decline in Genentech's stock price. Both Genentech and Roche are named as defendants, as well as Genentech Chief Executive Arthur Levinson and other individuals. The lawsuit seeks class-action status on behalf of other Genentech shareholders. The suit accuses Roche and the individual defendants of breaches of fiduciary duties to Genentech shareholders. It also seeks an injunction against the buyout proposal from being carried out in its current form. A Roche representative said the lawsuit was "without merit." "Roche is confident that all of its actions have been and will continue to be strictly in accordance with all applicable laws," the company representative said. Genentech, maker of cancer drugs Avastin and Herceptin, also said these types of shareholder lawsuits are to be expected. "We think these issues should be resolved fairly and justly. Beyond this, we aren't commenting on pending litigation," said Genentech spokeswoman Caroline Pecquet. According to the complaint, Genentech's board of directors will be unable to independently negotiate a fair deal because of the control structure that Roche holds over Genentech. Roche already owns 55.9 percent of the California-based company. While Genentech has indicated it is considering creating a special committee of its board to consider the buyout proposal, a committee, "which is truly independent of Roche is not possible given Roche's control over the company," the lawsuit contends. The lawsuit also says that under agreements between Roche and Genentech, Roche's directors must give prior approval of any deal involving the sale of all or major portions of Genentech's business, "effectively preventing any other potential bidder from making a bid for the company." Genentech shares rose 18 cents to close at $93.73 on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday. The shares are trading well above the $89-a-share offer unveiled on Monday, leading analysts to say they expect Roche will have to raise its offer.
