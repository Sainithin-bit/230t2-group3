 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Brewer Anheuser-Busch Cos Inc ( BUD.N ), which has agreed to be acquired by Belgian rival InBev NV INTB.BR, reported higher quarterly profit on Wednesday, helped by the launch of Bud Light Lime. 

 The maker of Budweiser and Michelob said second-quarter profit was $689 million, or 95 cents per share, compared with $677 million, or 88 cents per share, a year ago. Earlier this month, Anheuser accepted a sweetened $52 billion takeover bid from InBev. The deal will create the world's largest beer maker and end roughly 150 years of independence for St. Louis-based Anheuser. The combined Anheuser-InBev would have annual net sales of $36.4 billion and brew a quarter of the world's beer. (Reporting by  Martinne Geller ; editing by John Wallace)
