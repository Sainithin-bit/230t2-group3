 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid on Wednesday said he would like to see Senate passage of a housing reform bill today, but said there could be some delays by Republicans. 

 The U.S. House of Representatives is scheduled to vote on Wednesday on the legislation, sending it to the Senate. Senate approval would send the measure to President George W. Bush, who says he will sign it into law. "That would be great if it could go to the president today," Reid said. But noting that some Republicans could insist on a long debate of the bill, Reid said: "I don't think it can be derailed. They can slow it up a little bit."
