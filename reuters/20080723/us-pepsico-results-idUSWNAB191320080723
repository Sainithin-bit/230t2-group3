 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - PepsiCo Inc ( PEP.N ) reported higher quarterly profit on Wednesday, as the food and beverage maker benefited from strong international demand and the weak U.S. dollar. 

 The maker of Pepsi-Cola, Frito-Lay snacks and Quaker Oatmeal said net income rose to $1.7 billion, or $1.05 per share, in the second quarter ended June 14 from $1.56 billion, or 94 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding gains on commodity positions included in corporate unallocated expenses, earnings in the latest quarter were $1.03 per share. Since PepsiCo makes a wide range of products and does business in many countries, it has had an easier time offsetting the industrywide pressures of soaring commodity costs and a U.S. economic slowdown. The company, based in the New York City suburb of Purchase, said revenue and profit benefited from foreign exchange rates. The weakness of the U.S. dollar against many other currencies increases the value of overseas sales when they are converted to dollars for inclusion in companies' income statements.
