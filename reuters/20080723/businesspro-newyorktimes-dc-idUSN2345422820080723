 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - New York Times Co ( NYT.N ) reported 
lower quarterly profit and revenue on Wednesday as newspaper 
advertising revenue fell nearly 12 percent. 

  Second-quarter income from continuing operations fell 5.5 
percent to $20.9 million, while earnings per share from 
continuing operations were flat at 15 cents.  Revenue fell 6 percent to $741.9 million. Analysts' average 
forecast was $753.9 million, according to Reuters Estimates.  "During the quarter, we saw the continued effect on our 
business of the U.S. economic slowdown and secular forces 
playing out across the media industry," Chief Executive Janet 
Robinson said in a statement. "Print advertising continued to 
soften during the quarter, particularly in the classified 
areas."  The Times' results are similar to those of other U.S. 
newspaper publishers such as USA Today publisher Gannett Co Inc 
( GCI.N ) and Tampa Tribune publisher Media General Inc ( MEG.N ), 
which are trying to reverse persistent ad revenue declines and 
make more money from their online businesses.  The Times' stock price has fallen 44 percent in the past 
year as investor disenchantment with newspapers has grown.  That is not as devastating as the declines of 80 percent or 
more that some publishers have experienced, but it has stoked 
questions about whether the Ochs-Sulzberger family, which 
controls the Times, would ever sell the company it has 
controlled for more than a century.  Chairman Arthur Sulzberger Jr earlier this year said the 
company was "not for sale."  Second-quarter ad revenue fell 9.5 percent at New York 
Times Media Group, which includes the flagship New York Times 
newspaper. At its New England group, which includes the Boston 
Globe, ad revenue fell 15.1 percent. At its regional group, 
which includes the Times' other local papers, ad revenue fell 
16 percent.  Internet revenue rose 12.8 percent to $91.3 million. That 
represented about 12.3 percent of the company's total revenue 
during the quarter, compared with 10.3 percent a year earlier.  Circulation revenue rose 2.5 percent.  Net income for the entire company fell 82 percent to $21.1 
million. In the year-earlier quarter the company posted a gain 
from discontinued operations of $94 million.  (Reporting by  Robert MacMillan ; editing by John Wallace)
