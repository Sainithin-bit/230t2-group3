 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Furniture retailer Ethan Allen Interiors ( ETH.N ) reported a 46 percent drop in quarterly profit on Wednesday, hurt by declining sales and charges to restructure and close some of its design centers. 

 Earnings fell to $11.1 million, or 39 cents a share, for the fourth quarter that ended June 30, from $20.5 million, or 65 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding a restructuring charge, it said per-share profit in the latest quarter was 45 cents, which matched analysts' estimate, according to Reuters Estimates. "In these challenging times it makes sense to be prepared for further softening of the economy and also be ready for the next upturn," said Chairman and CEO Farooq Kathwari in a statement, adding: "As far as our financial performance is concerned, we expect to continue to do relatively well." Sales of discretionary items such as furniture have been hurt as consumers grapple with higher food and gasoline costs, tighter credit and the U.S. housing market slowdown. To improve results, Ethan Allen has been relocating stores to more vibrant retail zones. It has also been restructuring, converting some of its design center stores to smaller-sized design studio stores and closing other design centers. In the quarter, the company reported a $2.8 million restructuring charge. Total sales fell almost 9 percent to $235.9 million from $258.5 million. Wholesale sales declined 9.3 percent while retail division sales fell 5.9 percent. Same-store sales at the company's design centers fell 11.1 percent.
