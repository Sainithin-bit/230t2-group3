 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Philip Morris International Inc ( PM.N ) posted better-than-expected quarterly profit on Wednesday as the maker of the top-selling Marlboro brand shipped more cigarettes and was helped by the weak dollar. 

 The company also raised its full-year profit forecast. Philip Morris International, which was spun off from Altria Group Inc ( MO.N ) at the end of March, said second-quarter profit rose to $1.82 billion, or 86 cents a share, from $1.48 billion, or 70 cents a share, a year earlier. Analysts' average forecast was 83 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue, excluding excise taxes, rose 15 percent to $6.71 billion. Analysts, on average, had forecast $6.57 billion. "The report looked good on all fronts," Charles Norton, portfolio manager for the Vice Fund ( VICEX.O ), said. "Every single part of the report illustrated to us that they continue to fire on all cylinders, much more so than this unit was doing pre-spinoff." The company, which is comprised of the non-U.S.-based tobacco operations of the former Altria, shipped 223.17 billion cigarettes in the quarter, up 1 percent from a year earlier. Shipments rose 3.2 percent in Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa, as emerging markets helped lift Philip Morris International's sales and earnings. "Overall, we think second-quarter results reinforce PMI's strong position in the global tobacco market, with solid underlying operating growth being driven by healthy top-line growth and continued cost savings," said Goldman Sachs analyst Judy Hong in a research note. For the year, Philip Morris forecast earnings of $3.32 to $3.38 a share, up from its previous forecast of $3.18 to $3.24. Analysts' average forecast is $3.26 a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Shares of Philip Morris, which rose more than 3 percent on Tuesday in anticipation of the report, were up 2 cents at $52.07 at midday on the New York Stock Exchange.
