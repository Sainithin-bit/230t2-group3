 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Wyeth WYE.N on Wednesday said second-quarter earnings fell 7 percent, hurt by generic forms of its Protonix ulcer drug, although results beat estimates as they were helped by its vaccine for childhood infections and a drug for inflammatory disease. 

 Wyeth said it earned $1.12 billion, or 83 cents per share, compared with $1.2 billion, or 87 cents per share, in the year-earlier period. Excluding special items, Wyeth earned 91 cents per share, 4 cents ahead of the average estimate of analysts, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue rose 5 percent to $5.95 billion. Sales of its Effexor antidepressant rose 5 percent to $1.02 billion. Sales of its Prevnar vaccine to prevent pneumococca infections in children rose 9 percent to $691 million. Wyeth also benefited from its Enbrel drug, for which it shares rights with Amgen Inc ( AMGN.O ). The drug, for inflammatory diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, saw sales outside the United States and Canada rise 36 percent to $692 million. Wyeth's share of sales in the United States and Canada rose 6 percent to $284 million. Wyeth's branded Protonix sales have been under pressure by generic forms, launched by Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd TEVA.O late last year. Sales of Protonix fell 59 percent to $228 million.
