 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives was expected to vote some time after 3:30 p.m. (1930 GMT) on Wednesday on a major housing market rescue bill, including a plan to bolster mortgage finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, according to House leaders. 

 Passage was considered likely after about two hours of general debate on the bill, although delays were possible. Democrats who firmly control the House favor the measure. Approval would send it on to the Senate, where Democratic leaders are urging swift action. The White House said on Wednesday that President George W. Bush would sign the bill into law.
