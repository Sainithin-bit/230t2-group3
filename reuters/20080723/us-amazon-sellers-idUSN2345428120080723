 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc's ( AMZN.O ) active seller accounts have risen 18 percent over the prior year, the online retailer's chief financial officer said on Wednesday. 

 Besides selling goods to consumers, Amazon allows independent sellers to post items for sale on its website for which Amazon takes a commission. Analysts believe the company has been taking market share from rival eBay Inc ( EBAY.O ) among these third-party sellers. (Reporting by  Alexandria Sage ; Editing by  Braden Reddall )
