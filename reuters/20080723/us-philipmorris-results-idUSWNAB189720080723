 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Marlboro cigarette maker Philip Morris International Inc ( PM.N ) on Wednesday posted higher quarterly profit, helped by the weak dollar and an increase in the number of cigarettes shipped. 

 The company, which was spun off from Altria Group Inc ( MO.N ) at the end of March, said second-quarter profit rose to $1.82 billion, or 86 cents a share, from $1.48 billion, or 70 cents a share, a year earlier. (Reporting by  Brad Dorfman ; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn)
