 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - German drugs and chemicals company Merck KGaA ( MRCG.DE ) reported a 15 percent rise in second-quarter operating profit on Wednesday thanks to sales of liquid crystals and multiple-sclerosis and cancer drugs. 

 Operating profit rose to 320.5 million euros ($510 million) from 277.5 million euros a year earlier, slightly missing market expectations. A Reuters poll of 15 analysts had produced an average operating profit forecast of 326 million euros. Merck KGaA is also the world's largest supplier of the liquid crystal compounds used in televisions, mobile phones and computer laptops. (Reporting by  Mantik Kusjanto )
