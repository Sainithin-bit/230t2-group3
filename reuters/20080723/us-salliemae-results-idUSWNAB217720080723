 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Sallie Mae SLM.N, the largest U.S. student loan company, said on Wednesday second-quarter net income fell 72 percent, hurt by restructuring expenses, but results were better than analysts had expected. 

 The company managed to post a profit, which was a positive after the first quarter, when the company reported a $132.8 million net loss. At the time, the company said it could not make loans profitably, as the credit crunch weighed on its funding costs. But the company said its access to funding improved in the second quarter. Sallie Mae, legally known as SLM Corp, posted second-quarter net income of $266 million, or 50 cents a share, compared with net income of $966 million, or $1.03 a share, in the same quarter last year. On an adjusted basis, the company earned 55 cents a share, beating analysts' average forecast of 40 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates.
