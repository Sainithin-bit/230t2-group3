 TAIPEI  (Reuters) - Texas Instruments Inc TXN.N, the world's top mobile phone chip maker, said on Thursday it expects global sales for analog chips to double over the next seven years, fuelled by growing demand for consumer electronics. 

 Gregg Lowe, a TI senior vice president in charge of the company's analog business, said global analog chip sales should grow about 10 percent each year over the next few years. He added that at that growth rate, total global sales should double to about $74 billion within seven years from $37 billion last year. (Reporting by Baker Li, editing by Dominic Whiting)
