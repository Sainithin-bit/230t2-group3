 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The U.S. economy expanded at its fastest rate in four years during the third quarter, the government confirmed on Thursday, though it has slowed sharply since and is expected to keep doing so in 2008. 

 The Commerce department said gross domestic product, which measures total goods and services output within U.S. borders, expanded at a 4.9 percent annual rate in the third quarter - a final reading on performance that was unrevised from the estimate it made a month ago. Third-quarter growth was the strongest since GDP expanded at a 7.5 percent rate in the third quarter of 2003. Faster exports and increased inventory-building accounted for the pickup in third-quarter growth from the second quarter's 3.8 percent pace, but many economists say the ongoing drag from a weak housing sector and credit market turmoil will slow fourth-quarter expansion to 1 percent or less. Spending on new-home building contracted at a 20.5 percent rate during the third quarter, the steepest fall in more than 16 years, since a 21.7 plunge at the start of 1991 when the economy was headed toward a recession. The GDP report showed a price gauge closely watched by the Fed -- personal consumption spending excluding food and energy -- rising at a revised 2 percent annual rate in the third quarter instead of the 1.8 percent it estimated a month ago. Prices rose at a more modest 1.4 percent pace in the second quarter.
