 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - President George W. Bush on Thursday said he is not concerned about Wall Street firms seeking capital from funds controlled by foreign governments. 

 "I'm fine with capital coming in from overseas to help bolster financial institutions," Bush said at a news conference. The president's comments came a day after U.S. investment bank Morgan Stanley announced that China would invest $5 billion in the firm as it reported a fourth-quarter loss fueled by $9.4 billion of losses in subprime mortgages and other assets. "I think the world that is open for investment and trade is a world that will lead to overall prosperity," Bush said, though he emphasized that firms need to disclose their losses now. "My attitude is that Wall Street needs to put it all out there for everybody to see. If there are some write-downs to be done they need to do it now," he said.
