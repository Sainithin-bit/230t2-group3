 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The number of new claims filed for jobless benefits rose a larger-than-expected 12,000 last week, taking a four-week average of initial filings to its highest in more than two years in a sign the labor market is softening. 

 Initial claims for state unemployment insurance rose to 346,000 in the week ended December 15 from a slightly upwardly revised 334,000 in the prior week, the Labor Department said on Thursday. Wall Street economists predicted claims would rise to 335,000 from the originally reported 333,000 claims for the week ended December 8. The rise in new claims nudged the four-week moving average to up to 343,000, its highest since October 2005 when they measured 358,250. The moving average, which irons out week-to-week fluctuations, was 338,750 the prior week. The number of people remaining on the unemployment rolls after drawing an initial week of benefits rose by 12,000 to 2.65 million in the week ended December 8, the latest period for which these statistics were available. Wall Street economists had forecast the so-called continued claims at 2.60 million. The four-week moving average of continued claims, having risen for eight straight weeks, reached its highest in just under two years. The moving average jumped 23,000 to 2.63 million in the week ended December 8. That was the highest since December 31, 2005 when the moving average reached 2.64 million.
