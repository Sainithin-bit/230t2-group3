 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A Michigan court ordered a temporary 
halt on Thursday to the $4.9 billion sale of Manor Care Inc 
HCR.N to private equity firm Carlyle Group CYL.UL, 
according to an Ingham County Circuit Court order. 

  The order halts the proposed transaction, valued at $6.3 
billion including debt, until a January 2 hearing on the deal. 
Manor Care said in a statement earlier on Thursday that Carlyle 
had completed regulatory approval and was closing the 
transaction.  Shares of Manor Care, which operates nursing homes, closed 
up 1.3 percent on Thursday at $66.70 on the New York Stock 
Exchange.  (Reporting by  Jonathan Keehner ; Editing by  Leslie Gevirtz )
