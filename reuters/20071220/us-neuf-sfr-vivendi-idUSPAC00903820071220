 PARIS  (Reuters) - French telecoms and media firm Vivendi ( VIV.PA ) said on Friday it planned to raise 1-2 billion euros in equity as its SFR mobile unit prepares to buy into Neuf Cegetel and announces a bid for the rest. 

 The timing will depend on market conditions, it said in a statement. The deal will boost adjusted net earnings per share from 2009, Vivendi said.
