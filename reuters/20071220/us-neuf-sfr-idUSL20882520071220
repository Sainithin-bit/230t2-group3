 PARIS  (Reuters) - France's Vivendi ( VIV.PA ) ignited talk of an acquisition spree on Thursday by saying it might tap the market for up to 2.0 billion euros ($2.9 billion) as its mobile unit SFR launched a bid for fixed-line ally Neuf Cegetel. 

 The long-awaited 2.05 billion euro offer for Neuf Cegetel NEUF.PA is aimed at bolstering SFR's fiber optics assets, needed to speed up communications and allow for new services -- and to create a stronger challenger to dominant France Telecom FTE.PA. SFR, France's second largest mobile phone operator which is 56 percent owned by Vivendi, will issue debt to help fund the purchase. But Vivendi said it could also raise 1 to 2 billion euros in equity to keep flexibility for more acquisitions. "We are just telling our shareholders we might very very slightly dilute them. The decision (to increase capital) has not been taken yet," Chief Executive Jean-Bernard Levy told Reuters. Vivendi has been active in buying telecom and media assets this year and recently announced a large acquisition by its video games division in the United States. "In the last twelve months, Vivendi has done major deals in all its five businesses, TPS, Bertelsmann Music Publishing, Maroc Telecom in Africa, today Neuf Cegetel, and I am not even talking about Activision (video games maker)," Levy said. More deals could be on the cards as Levy repeated Vivendi's interest in eventually acquiring the 44 percent minority stake held by Britain's Vodafone Group Plc ( VOD.L ) in SFR and gain control over 100 percent of pay-TV group Canal Plus France. He added the Neuf Cegetel deal had the full backing of Vodafone. MORE DEALS IN THE CARDS ? UBS analyst Ian Whittaker said Vivendi's plan to raise capital could indicate the conglomerate was keeping its powder dry for further deals -- or trying to protect its credit rating. "We see Neuf as a sensible evolutionary deal, but concerns over the capital increase rationale and a potential acquisition spree may hold back the shares near-term," Whittaker said. Standard & Poor's Ratings Services placed on CreditWatch with negative implications the 'BBB' long-term and 'A-2' short-term corporate credit ratings of Vivendi, because of the expected cash outflow. Neuf Cegetel had consolidated gross debt of 1.2 billion euros at June 30, 2007, S&P said. Vivendi said the deal would boost its adjusted net earnings per share from 2009. Analysts believe the deal will boost Vivendi's earnings by around 5 percent to 2009 -- before the capital increase -- including around 1.0 billion euros of tax credit benefits SFR can automatically claim if it controls 95 percent or more of Neuf. Under the terms of the deal, SFR will buy the 29.5 percent stake held by trading house Louis Dreyfus in Neuf Cegetel for 34.50 euros per share. SFR will then launch a cash offer for the outstanding shares of Neuf Cegetel at 36.50 euros per share, including the 2007 dividend. Neuf Cegetel shares, which had been suspended on Tuesday, resumed trading at 4 a.m. ET. By 6:12 a.m. the stock was off 3.5 percent at 35.46 euros. Vivendi shares gained 0.5 percent at 31.25 euros. Analysts noted the 36.5 euro offer for minority shareholders was lower than the 40-euro-per-share deal tipped by newspapers this week.
