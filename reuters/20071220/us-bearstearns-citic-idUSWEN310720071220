 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Bear Stearns Cos Inc BSC.N said on Thursday its alliance with Chinese brokerage Citic Securities is expected close in the first half of 2008. 

 Chief Financial Officer Sam Molinaro also said the company will monitor market conditions to determine whether it needs to further cut staff and expenses. He made his remarks during a conference call with analysts and investors. During the fourth quarter, Bear Stearns cut about 1,400 employees, or about 9 percent of its work force. The company's mortgage origination and securitization areas were the hardest hit. The job cuts resulted in a one-time severance cost of about $100 million, Molinaro said.
