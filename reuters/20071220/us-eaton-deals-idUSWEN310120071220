 CHICAGO/NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Diversified industrial manufacturer Eaton Corp said on Thursday it plans to acquire two companies in Europe and Asia to expand its electrical systems business outside the United States, sending its shares up nearly 5 percent. 

 Cleveland-based Eaton offered to buy The Moeller Group, a German electrical components maker, for 1.55 billion euros ($2.23 billion) and said it launched a tender offer for Taiwan- based Phoenixtec Power Co Ltd, which makes uninterruptible power supply systems, at NT$50 per share ($1.54 per share), which it said would make the net purchase price $565 million. Phoenixtec's chairman and members of its board of directors have already agreed to tender 25 percent of the company's shares to Eaton, the company said. Eaton expects the deals to add 25 cents to 35 cents per share to operating earnings in 2009. In a telephone interview with Reuters, Eaton Chief Executive Officer Alexander "Sandy" Cutler said the two acquisitions would continue the company's plan to diversify geographically, plus between its electrical systems and its automotive businesses. Following the completion of these acquisitions, Eaton's electrical systems will make up 74 percent of the company's business and 55 percent of sales will come from outside the United States. Cutler said he could not put a figure on how much of Eaton's business should eventually come from its global units, but added: "If the United States accounts for approximately 25 percent of global GDP, then it's logical that any truly globally capable company would reflect that." Eaton is buying Moeller from UK-based buyout firm Doughty Hanson. The private equity firm which bought its majority stake in Moeller in September 2005, said it will realize returns on its equity investment of three times. The two companies combined have estimated 2007 sales of $2 billion, Eaton said, adding that their distribution networks and manufacturing facilities will help boost Eaton's competitive position outside the United States. Once the acquisitions close, Eaton's electrical business will have annual revenues of more than $7.5 billion, with the majority of those revenues stemming from international business, the company said. The company expects the deals to be neutral to operating earnings in 2008, but that, including the deals, Eaton expects 2008 revenue to grow by 25 percent overall and forecast 2008 operating earnings per share growth of 15 percent to 20 percent. Eaton expects the Moeller deal to close in the first quarter of 2008. It said it will finance the deals with a mixture of cash, debt and equity. CEO Cutler said that as these two deals will bring the company's total acquisitions for 2007 to 10, the company will likely be less aggressive in pursuing new acquisitions in 2008. "For much of 2008 we will be focused on integrating these acquisitions into our operations," he said. In trade on the New York Stock Exchange, Eaton shares were up $4.05, or 4.53 percent, at $93.47. The company reached a 52-week high of $104.12 on July 19 and a 52-week low of $71.91 on January 11. Eaton has been trading at 13.15 times projected earnings, compared with a sector after of 18.57 times. (Additional reporting by  Mathieu Robbins , editing by Will Waterman/Andre Grenon)
