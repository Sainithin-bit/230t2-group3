 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Investment banks Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ) and Lehman Brothers LEH.N are among the bidders for a stake in Japanese house builder Daito Trust Construction Co ( 1878.T ), which may lead to a multibillion-dollar buyout, sources familiar with the deal said on Thursday. 

 Goldman Sachs ( GS.N ) and Aetos Capital LLC are also interested in acquiring Daito, they added. Trading in shares of Daito Trust was halted by the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Before trade was stopped the shares shot up 15.7 percent to 6,490 yen, giving it a market value of about 804 billion yen ($7.1 billion). "Including a premium on the deal, this could be a double-digit billion dollar deal," one of the sources said. Daito Trust's founder and chairman, Katsumi Tada, is selling his roughly 28 percent stake in the company, the sources said. That stake sale could lead to a buyout, with the winning bidder taking the whole company private. Japanese investment bank Nomura Holdings ( 8604.T ) is orchestrating the sale.
