 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Bear Stearns Co Inc BSC.N said on Thursday it expects revenue in 2008 to be higher than levels in 2007, when revenue plunged on big write-downs on subprime mortgage-related assets. 

 Chief Financial Officer Sam Molinaro said 2008 revenue, however, likely will be lower than the level in 2006, a boom time for Bear Stearns' key fixed-income business. Molinaro also said he expects the company's energy business to make a big contribution to revenue in 2008. (Reporting by  Tim McLaughlin ; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe)
