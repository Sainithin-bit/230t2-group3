 PARIS  (Reuters) - Neuf Cegetel NEUF.PA said on Thursday its two main shareholders, mobile operator SFR ( VIV.PA ) and trading house Louis Dreyfus, had reached an agreement allowing SFR to buy the 29.5 percent stake that Louis Dreyfus has in Neuf Cegetel. 

 Neuf Cegetel added SFR would launch a cash offer on the shares of Neuf Cegetel held by minority shareholders at a price of 36.50 euros per share, with the 2007 dividend coupon attached. Neuf Cegetel said it expected trading in its shares to resume on Thursday. (Reporting by Dominique Vidalon)
