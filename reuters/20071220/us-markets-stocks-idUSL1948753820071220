 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Stocks rose on Thursday, led by technology shares, as a reassuring profit and outlook from Oracle Corp ORCL.O offset nagging concerns about financial companies' exposure to bad debt. 

 The world's No. 2 software maker drove the Nasdaq up more than 1 percent, when it reported higher earnings on robust software sales and forecast revenue that topped earlier expectations. But worries about the extent of losses that banks and insurers may still incur held back the broader market. Bond insurer MBIA Inc ( MBI.N ) said it had exposure to a startling $8.1 billion of the riskiest mortgage securities, pushing its shares down 26.2 percent. Adding to concern, the Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank's index of business activity plunged to its weakest in more than four years in December. "Tech has been strong all day," said Bennett Gaeger, managing director at Stifel Nicolaus in Baltimore. "Oracle was a big one, and that really put the bid back into the sector. And I think with Oracle being such a bellwether, its strong outlook relieved some of the worries about recession." The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  was up 38.37 points, or 0.29 percent, at 13,245.64. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  was up 7.12 points, or 0.49 percent, at 1,460.12. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  was up 39.85 points, or 1.53 percent, at 2,640.86. But with the holidays approaching, trading was light on the NYSE. About 1.38 billion shares changed hands, falling short of last year's estimated daily average of 1.84 billion. Meanwhile, on Nasdaq, about 2.00 billion shares traded, slightly below last year's daily average of 2.02 billion. Wireless chip and technology developer Qualcomm added to optimism about the technology sector, raising its estimates for the current quarter on strong demand for advanced phones. Shares of Qualcomm rose 2.2 percent to $39.12, while Oracle shot up 6.5 percent to $22.10, both on the Nasdaq. Google Inc ( GOOG.O ) also contributed to the Nasdaq's gains. The Web search company's shares rose 1.8 percent to $689.69 after the U.S. Federal Trade Commission approved its $3.1 billion purchase of DoubleClick, saying the much criticized deal did not pose a threat to competition in Internet advertising. And video game publisher Activision Inc ( ATVI.O ) raised its outlook for revenue and earnings in the third quarter, citing strong consumer response to its holiday slate. Activision's shares rose 4.3 percent to $27.96 on Nasdaq. Among the Dow's major advancers were tech bellwethers IBM and Microsoft. Shares of International Business Machines Corp ( IBM.N ) gained 1.6 percent to $108.84 on the NYSE, while Microsoft Corp ( MSFT.O ) stock added 2.1 percent to $35.52 on Nasdaq. Financial stocks were the primary drag on the S&P, with shares of Citigroup Inc ( C.N ), the No. 1 U.S. bank, off 0.9 percent at $29.93. MBIA shares fell 26.2 percent to $19.95 and ranked among the biggest percentage losers on the NYSE. Bear Stearns Cos Inc shares BSC.N gained 0.9 percent to close at $91.42 on the NYSE. Earlier in the session, the stock had slid to a 52-week low at $88 after the fifth-largest U.S. investment bank posted its first loss in the company's history. The Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank's index of business activity fell to minus 5.7, a sign of contraction in the region's manufacturing sector. On the New York Stock Exchange, advancers beat decliners by a ratio of about 9 to 7 and on the Nasdaq by 3 to 2. (Editing by  Jan Paschal )
