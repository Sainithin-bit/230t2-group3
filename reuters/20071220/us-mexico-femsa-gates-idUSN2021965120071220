 MEXICO CITY  (Reuters) - Billionaire Bill Gates has taken a stake worth $392 million in Mexican drinks company Femsa, according to a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing on Thursday. 

 Gates' Cascade Investment LLC fund owns 10.81 million of Femsa's ( FMSAUBD.MX ) ( FMX.N ) New York-traded American Depositary Shares, a minority investment in the company. Gates, who is chairman of Microsoft Corp ( MSFT.O ), reported the stake in a passive filing with the SEC, which does not require the investor to report when the securities were acquired or the purpose behind the transactions. Femsa's shares jumped 7.5 percent on Wall Street on Thursday. (Reporting by Cyntia Barrera Diaz, Chris Aspin; editing by Carol Bishopric)
