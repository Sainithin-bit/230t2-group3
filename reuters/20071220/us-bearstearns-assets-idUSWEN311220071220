 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Bear Stearns Cos Inc's BSC.N hard-to-sell assets are expected to escalate as market conditions for fixed-income securities remain challenging, Chief Financial Officer Sam Molinaro said on Thursday. 

 Molinaro said about 7 percent of Bear's assets are level 3, or hard-to-sell assets. "Given a lack of liquidity in the marketplace for many instruments, it's reasonable that some ... Level 2 assets would move to Level 3," he said on a conference call. "It is anticipated that the amount of Level 3 assets will increase by approximately $7 billion when compared to the August 31 amounts," he said.
