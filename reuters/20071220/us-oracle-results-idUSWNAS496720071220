 BOSTON  (Reuters) - Oracle Corp ORCL.O posted a 35 percent rise in quarterly profit on higher-than-expected software sales and issued a strong outlook, easing concerns it may be hurt by the slowing U.S. economy and pushing its shares up 6.5 percent. 

 The world's second-largest software maker on Wednesday forecast new software license revenue would rise 15 percent to 25 percent in the current quarter from a year ago, a growth rate that analysts said was above their expectations. Oracle also forecast earnings per share excluding items of 29 cents or 30 cents, which compared to the average analyst forecast of 29 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. "That is highly encouraging. They sent a confident message," said Broadpoint Securities analyst Mark Murphy. He had forecast a 5 percent increase in new software sales and the bulk of Wall Street analysts were looking for sales to rise no more than 15 percent. Oracle's growth has accelerated over the past few years as it built on an acquisition binge, snapping up smaller software makers. Those deals have broadened the company's portfolio, reducing its dependence on sales to companies in any particular industry that might get hurt in a slowdown. "It's a diversified applications business," Chief Executive Larry Ellison said during a conference call on the results. During tough economic times, companies have some room to delay modernizing some of their computer systems, such as ones that handle human resources and accounting, he said. But Oracle does not expect demand to slow for other products in its portfolio, such as ones that help businesses comply with new government regulations, Ellison said. Oracle said net income in its fiscal second quarter ended November 30 rose 35 percent to $1.3 billion, or 25 cents per share, from $967 million, or 18 cents a share, a year earlier. Profit excluding items was 31 cents per share, beating the average analyst forecast for 27 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue climbed 28 percent to $5.3 billion, above the average forecast of $5.04 billion. "We were thinking a penny or two beat would be a good quarter. This was a great quarter," said Goldman Sachs analyst Sarah Friar. "They are taking share away from the small guys. They are doing a great job of cross-selling from their install base." Oracle said new software sales rose 38 percent to $1.7 billion in the second quarter, led by a 63 percent increase in business management applications. Database and middleware sales rose 28 percent. "They beat me on every matrix, so they are to be credited," said WR Hambrecht analyst Robert Stimson. "Their technology is so important so they are a little shielded from some (economic) issues, because you have to have technology to move forward. You need to have technology to cut out some of the people costs." Chief Financial Officer Safra Catz said on the conference call that Oracle had posted its fastest software sales growth in more than a decade. "We are seeing more deals and each deal is a little bigger than in the past," said Catz. Oracle also said it was not optimistic it could reach a deal to buy business software maker BEA Systems Inc BEAS.O, which in October rejected its $6.7 billion takeover bid. "Over the last few weeks we have been in contact with their bankers and lawyers and as a result of those discussions, we've concluded that no friendly deal can be done with the current BEA Board at a price and terms acceptable to Oracle," Catz said. BEA shares were quoted at $15.65 in extended trade, below their Nasdaq close of $15.72. Oracle's offer was equal to $17 per share.
