 LONDON  (Reuters) - Britain's building societies attracted a third month of record deposits in November, indicating savers continue to pull cash from ailing bank Northern Rock NRK.L. 

 Building societies had net receipts of 2.3 billion pounds ($4.6 billion) last month, below a record 3 billion in October but still the third-highest month on record and almost three times last November's level. The societies have attracted net deposits of 8.2 billion pounds in the last three months, close to the level for all of 2006. "Much of these savings are likely to come from further withdrawals from Northern Rock bank," Adrian Coles, director general of the Building Societies Association, said. "A perception of a possible change in the economic environment may also mean that greater attention is being given to savings these days," he added in a statement. Mortgage lending by building societies dropped, however, as borrowers face the threat of a slowing housing market. Gross lending was 4.1 billion pounds in November, compared to 4.6 billion in November 2006. Thousands of Northern Rock customers have closed accounts since September 14, when it sought emergency loans from the Bank of England due to a funding crisis. The news prompted the first run on a major British bank for over 140 years, which only ended when the government guaranteed all deposits. (Reporting by  Steve Slater ; Editing by Quentin Bryar)
