 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Toys "R" Us is operating in a "very difficult" traditional toy environment amid weaker retail demand and the toy retailer's third-quarter results should concern toy stock investors, a BMO Capital Markets research note said on Thursday. 

 "(Toys "R" Us) noted a shift to private label toys in the U.S. and concedes that recalls may have an indirect impact on consumer demand," wrote toy analyst Gerrick Johnson in the note. "... We think this commentary, particularly the increase in sales of private label toys, points to an economic slowdown." He said the shift toward private labels, which tend to carry higher margins than branded goods, may be positive for Toys "R" Us, but "we think it is a bad omen for the branded toy companies we cover." Toys "R" Us reported in a regulatory filing on Wednesday that sales, including video games, for the 13 weeks ended November 3 at U.S. stores open at least year decreased 2.2 percent from a year ago. International same-store sales increased 2 percent and Babies "R" Us same-store sales rose 1.2 percent. The company said in the filing the decrease in comparable net sales for U.S. stores was due to lower sales in its learning, core toys, juvenile and seasonal categories, which underwent product assortment changes. It said the decreases were partially offset by strong demand for the Nintendo Co Ltd's 7974.OS Wii video game system. Toys "R" Us, which is co-owned by private equity firms Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co KKR.UL, Bain Capital and Vornado Realty Trust ( VNO.N ), reported a net loss of $76 million for the 13 weeks ended November 3, compared with earnings of $41 million for the year-earlier period. Net sales, however, increased 9.7 percent to $2.78 billion for the period. Toy retailers have been facing a tough year with an onslaught of toy recalls and wary consumers coping with rising food and fuel costs, mortgage woes and a credit crunch. Millions of Chinese-made toys have been recalled in recent months for excessive lead content or other problems. Some of the most popular branded toys sold in the United States, including Thomas the Tank Engine, Curious George and SpongeBob SquarePants, have been pulled from shelves for unsafe levels of lead and other hazards, such as small magnets. Toys "R" Us said in its filing that the recalls "may have had, and may continue to have, an indirect impact on consumer demand for toys in general." Johnson said in the research note that inventory levels seemed slightly elevated at the company, but mostly in line. He also said: "Increase in operating expenses due to investments in physical assets and personnel underscores the retailer's commitment to improved shopper experiences."
