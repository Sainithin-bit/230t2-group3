 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Fitch Ratings on Thursday said it may cut its top "AAA" rating for bond insurer MBIA Insurance Corp, citing its exposure to deteriorating mortgage-related investments, including collateralized debt obligations. 

 Fitch also said it may cut its "AA" rating on the insurer's parent, MBIA Inc ( MBI.N ). MBIA, the world's largest bond insurer, said on its Web site late Wednesday that it has exposure to $30.6 billion in complex mortgage securities that it insures, an amount that eclipses its entire net worth. Fitch said it expects to downgrade MBIA Insurance's "AAA" rating one notch to "AA-plus" if the company does not obtain more capital commitments or put in place reinsurance or other risk mitigation measures in the next four to six weeks.
