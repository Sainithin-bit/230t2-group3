 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The U.S. services sector will likely take the lead in a labor market recovery, ahead of the factory sector, as the economy shows signs of emerging from the worst downturn in 70 years, Joel Prakken, chairman of Macroeconomic Advisers, said on Wednesday. 

 While data has showed that a manufacturing rebound might be underway, the services industries are poised to create more jobs first. This is partly because small firms that represent a sizable portion of the sector tend to boost their payrolls as business improves, Prakken said. "Services sector employment will turn around first," Prakken said on a conference call after the release of the ADP National Employment Report, jointly developed by Macroeconomic Advisers LLC and ADP Employer Services. "Manufacturing job creation is still lagging," he said. The report showed U.S. private employers cut 298,000 jobs in August, the lowest since September 2008 and fewer than a revised 360,000 lost in July, originally reported as 371,000. But the job losses were steeper than the 250,000 median forecast by economists surveyed by Reuters. The ADP National Employment Report is a proxy among some analysts for the government's monthly nonfarm payrolls report. The U.S. Labor Department will release August payroll data at 8:30 a.m. EDT on Friday. Although labor deterioration has slowed, companies are still firing workers. Moreover, government job gains will likely be modest as state and local governments face falling tax revenues, according to Prakken. This means the jobless rate will resume its uptrend in August after falling for the first time in 15 months in July, Prakken said. "There is a gradual improvement in employment under way ... That's the good news," he said. "The bad news is that we still have several months of job losses to go." The jobless rate will peak about 9.9 percent toward the end of this year, Prakken predicted. The government's unemployment rate is seen rising to 9.5 percent in August from 9.4 percent in July. (Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe)
