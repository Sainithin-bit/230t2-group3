 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Global stocks slipped and the yen rose to a seven-week high against the dollar on Wednesday as investors grew apprehensive about the strength of economic recovery, raising the appeal of gold and other safe-havens. 

 A U.S. private-sector jobs report showed moderating losses in the labor market in August, but the job cuts were greater than forecast and highlighted uncertainty over the economy. The yen also jumped to seven-week highs against the euro and sterling on the data, which came two days ahead of the U.S. government's August unemployment report. Gold extended gains past $980 an ounce to its highest in almost three months as concern over the recent slide in global equity markets raised the metal's cachet. The wobbly stock market and disappointing jobs report fed a safe-haven bid for U.S. government debt too. Prices of Treasuries edged higher, pushing benchmark yields to seven-week lows. Minutes from the U.S. Federal Reserve's recent policy meeting, released Wednesday, showed officials thought risks to the U.S. economy had eased but low interest rates would be needed for some time to bolster what would be at best a modest recovery. The ADP Employer Services report said U.S. private employers cut 298,000 jobs in August, down from 360,000 job losses in July, but above economists' forecast for losses of only 250,000. The report comes two days ahead of the closely watched U.S. government data on non-farm payrolls. Euro zone government bond prices rose as European equities fell for the third straight session and investors awaited a European Central Bank policy decision amid a raft of supply from France and Spain. The jobs market has been slow to improve and consumer confidence has stumbled, clouding hopes demand from shoppers will fuel economic growth. Analysts polled by Reuters expect a loss of 225,000 jobs in Friday's non-farm payroll report. "We don't see any big rebound after the declines we've had because people are still wary," said Chad Morganlander, portfolio manager at Stifel, Nicolaus & Co in Florham Park, New Jersey. Investors are waiting for Friday's non-farm payrolls data, Morganlander said, adding: "investors are turning to gold as a hedge" against financial malady, suggesting a high anxiety level on Wall Street. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  closed down 29.93 points, or 0.32 percent, at 9,280.67. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  fell 3.29 points, or 0.33 percent, at 994.75. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  slipped 1.82 points, or 0.09 percent, at 1,967.07. Financial shares again led decliners. The KBW Bank Index .BKX lost 2.3 percent. Among regional banks, SunTrust Banks ( STI.N ) was down 7.2 percent. Oil prices settled unchanged after government data showing a smaller-than-expected drop in U.S. crude stocks offset a steep drop in gasoline inventories. Crude stocks dropped 400,000 barrels in the week to August 28, less than the 600,000 barrel drop expected by analysts. Gasoline inventories showed a steep 3 million barrel drop, however, as U.S. fuel demand -- battered by the recession over the past year -- rose slightly over year-ago levels. "The EIA inventory data is overall proving to be neutral," said Phil Flynn, analyst for PFGBest Research in Chicago. U.S. crude for October delivery settled unchanged at $68.05, while London Brent crude fell 23 cents to $67.50 a barrel. Copper prices bounced from a near two-week low. Copper for December delivery in New York eked out an 0.75 cent gain to close at $2.8260 a pound. The dollar fell 0.8 percent to 92.14 yen after hitting a low of 92.07, according to Reuters data. The dollar index, a measure of the U.S. currency against a basket of other major units, was last down 0.5 percent at 78.391 .DXY. European shares closed lower for a third straight day on Wednesday, with financial stocks suffering the most, as investors took profits after a strong run. The FTSEurofirst 300  .FTEU3  index of top European shares fell 0.4 percent to close at 950.41 points. Japan's Nikkei  .N225  closed down 2.4 percent and the MSCI index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS shed 1.3 percent, pressured by Wall Street's drop on Tuesday.
