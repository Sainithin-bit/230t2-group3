 BERLIN  (Reuters) - Germany still prefers Canadian auto parts group Magna's MGa.TO bid for carmaker Opel despite an improved offer from rival suitor RHJ International ( RHJI.BR ), a spokesman from the German economy ministry said on Wednesday. 

 "We can confirm that we are aware of the improved offer (from RHJ)," said the spokesman Steffen Moritz. "After examining the offer, Magna remains the government's preferred bidder." (Reporting by  Noah Barkin  and  Brian Rohan )
