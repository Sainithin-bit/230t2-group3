 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. private employers cut 298,000 jobs in August, fewer than a revised 360,000 jobs lost in July, a report by a private employment service said on Wednesday. 

 KEY POINTS: * The July decline was originally reported at 371,000 last month. * The median of estimates from 31 economists surveyed by Reuters for the ADP Employer Services report, jointly developed with Macroeconomic Advisers LLC, was for 250,000 private-sector jobs lost last month. COMMENTS: FRANK LESH, FUTURES ANALYST, BROKER, FUTUREPATH TRADING LLC, CHICAGO: "Well it's not a lot of reaction but not actually a good number really. ADP was called at 250,000 came in at 298,000. No help there. I don't know that we're going to react a whole lot to that, we've already had a pretty good selloff. Not much reaction to it at this point. It's not that much worse, either -- still in the 200,000's, I guess. Not a lot of reaction at this point, dealing with bigger things at the moment, I believe. The correlation between Friday's number is sometimes real good and sometimes real bad, so it's hard to make a lot out of this. I don't think we are going to move the markets much on the ADP today." WIN THIN, SENIOR CURRENCY STRATEGIST, BROWN BROTHERS HARRIMAN, NEW YORK: "The ADP report is slightly worse than expected, but it's still better than the most recent numbers. It was certainly better than June. So I would say the trend is improving but the bottom line though is that the U.S. economy is still bleeding jobs and as result we're seeing selling in risk trades in the currency market." PETER KENNY, MANAGING DIRECTOR, KNIGHT EQUITY MARKETS, JERSEY CITY, NEW JERSEY: "It's pretty much in line. The market isn't reacting terribly negatively to it. An argument could be made that since the decline continues to decelerate, that's very positive for the market. It may give the market a chance to reverse the downward trend it's had for the past four sessions. "It's fairly good news, it could been much worse. I think the Street was bracing for something worse, which is why you've seen the selloff we've had recently. This number doesn't confirm the Street's fears. "The number gives me a lack of conviction that the number will be horrible on Friday. There's been this whisper number that Friday's number will be horrific. The ADP number doesn't confirm that. This takes a lot of pressure off the market." MARKET REACTION: STOCKS: U.S. stock index futures extend losses after weaker-than-expected ADP report. BONDS: U.S. Treasury debt prices cut losses. DOLLAR: U.S. dollar extends losses versus yen, adds to gains versus euro.
