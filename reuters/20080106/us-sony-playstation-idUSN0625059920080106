 LAS VEGAS  (Reuters) - Sony Corp sold 1.2 million PlayStation 3 video game consoles in North America over the holiday season, the company said on Sunday. 

 The company also said it sold 1.4 million of its handheld PSP devices and 1.3 million units of the older PlayStation 2. The sales figures covered the period from November 23 to December 31. Sales of Sony's PS3 have trailed those of Microsoft Corp's Xbox 360 and Nintendo Co Ltd's Wii consoles due to what analysts say is its relatively high price and lack of must-have games.
