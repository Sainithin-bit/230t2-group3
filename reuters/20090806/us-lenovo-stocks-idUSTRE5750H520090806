 HONG KONG  (Reuters) - The world's No.4 PC brand Lenovo ( 0992.HK ) dropped 6.8 percent on Thursday as investors locked in gains on the recent sharp rally in its shares after the company reported a smaller-than-expected first-quarter loss. 

 By 0237 GMT, the stock was down 5.8 percent at HK$3.44 after scraping a low of HK$3.40 earlier in the session, extending Wednesday's sharp losses. The stock jumped more than 50 percent in the three weeks to Tuesday when it scaled its highest level in more than 10 months. Lenovo posted a net loss of $16.01 million for the April-June quarter, its third straight quarterly shortfall, but better than market expectations for a $54 million loss. Lenovo shares have risen more than 80 percent this year, compared with a 40 percent advance on the benchmark Hang Seng index  .HSI . The company has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of China's move to encourage consumer spending, with almost half of all computers sold under a rural subsidy program carrying its brand name.
