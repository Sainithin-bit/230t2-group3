 LONDON  (Reuters) - Following are reactions from economists after the Bank of England said on Thursday it would boost its quantitative easing program by 50 billion stg to 175 billion stg. It held rates unchanged at 0.5 percent 

 ECONOMISTS' COMMENTS Latest comments JONATHAN LOYNES, CHIEF UK ECONOMIST, CAPITAL ECONOMICS "The key is the extra 50 billion pounds, and our response, is that it is encouraging. We felt, unlike some people, that they would have to extend QE. They have actually done it a bit more than we anticipated at this stage. "But given the fragility of the economic recovery and doubts over the ultimate effect, I would not want to say this is the end of it -- if they decide in three months' time that the economy still needs more stimulus they might actually do more. "It does not tell us anything about the economic outlook than we did not already know. The fact that they are responding to that outlook I think is encouraging, but we still have major doubts over just how effective QE is likely to be." -- Earlier comments ALAN CLARKE, ECONOMIST, BNP PARIBAS "I thought they would probably go a little bit further, I thought the QE in total would get to 200 billion pounds. For now we are at 175, more than most people thought. "I thought the statement sets out the outlook very well indeed, it is a credit to the Bank of England. "Confidence has improved and the global economy has stabilized, although we are much deeper in recession than we previously thought. That is, the starting point is much lower and ultimately the margin of spare capacity in this economy is going to bear down on inflation in the medium term for some time to come. "The fact that they are doing 50 (billion pounds of QE) over the next three months is a little bit quicker than I thought. I thought 250 for the next six months." -- HOWARD ARCHER, GLOBAL INSIGHT "The MPC's decision to extend its Quantitative Easing program by 50 billion pounds to 175 billion indicates that the committee continues to have serious concerns about long-term growth prospects and persistent muted bank lending to businesses. "Despite the recent improved data, the economy continues to face serious headwinds and sustainable recovery is still very far from certain. The Bank of England itself has long been concerned that economic activity could be hindered for some considerable time to come by the ongoing need for financial institutions, households and companies to adjust their balance sheets. "Furthermore, bank lending to businesses remains very weak and spreads on bank loans are elevated, which is a serious threat to recovery prospects." -- PHILIP SHAW, CHIEF ECONOMIST, INVESTEC "Whilst the MPC has noted some improvement in economic and financial conditions, it stresses the fragility of the current situation, and its decision to expand QE by a further 50 billion seems very much driven by its view that inflation will remain very subdued over the medium term. -- ROSS WALKER, ECONOMIST, RBS FINANCIAL MARKETS "A huge surprise. All the rhetoric seemed to point to not doing very much more, even up to the 150 (billion pounds level of quantitative easing) seemed odds-against after the better surveys. "Looking at the initial headlines, I'm just struck by how backward looking a lot of it is, focusing on the economy in recession and that there is a large output gap. We knew all that, what has changed? "They seem to be giving much more weight to the backward looking data, how they judge the current position, rather than believing the better surveys. "Some of the comments on the money supply almost contradict the recent signals from them, where they have been emphasizing that things have been improving. Now it's 'oh well, it's all very weak'. "At least we have now some greater clarity. It is a decisive move and there seems to be a clearer narrative, though it does to my mind almost contradict a lot of the previous signals." -- AMIT KARA, UK ECONOMIST, UBS "It is exactly in line with our prescription. We recommended a 50 billion pound expansion and to phase it over a longer period of time which is exactly what they have done. "I think it is the right thing to do, and this announcement will make it possible for the MPC to revisit the QE programed at the November inflation report."
