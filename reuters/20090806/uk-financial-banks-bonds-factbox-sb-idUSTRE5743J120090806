 (Reuters) - European banks are readying a return to the subordinated bond market to help repair their balance sheets, aided by an investor rush for fat returns on these high-risk securities. 

 Following is a summary of the different categories of bonds issued by banks: SENIOR UNSECURED DEBT These are bonds are at the top of the list to be repaid if a bank fails. In a liquidation, senior unsecured debt ranks alongside deposits in most countries. After governments in Europe had to step in to shore up weak banks, investors became nervous that a government could change these rules if it nationalised or restructured a bank. "We think it very unlikely ... that a government would alter the position of senior bondholders if a bank were nationalised," CreditSights said in a research note. SUBORDINATED AND HYBRID BONDS * Lower Tier 2 bonds - The main difference between senior bonds and these subordinated bonds is their lower ranking in a liquidation. These bonds have final maturity dates, but also options for early redemption dates or "call" dates. The Lower Tier 2 market was thrown into turmoil by a number of banks not repaying bonds as expected on these call dates. These bonds pay a coupon and if this is missed it's a default. In the UK, however, legislation allowed Bradford & Bingley to defer coupon payments on its Lower Tier 2 bonds without it being classed as a default. Recent issues have been in "bullet" format, which eliminates the uncertainty over early redemption by setting a final fixed maturity. * Upper Tier 2 bonds - These bonds fall between Lower Tier 2 and Tier 1 in terms of ranking in a liquidation. The main difference from Tier 1 (see below) is that interest payments are cumulative if they are deferred. Missed coupon payments do not count as a default. * Tier 1 bonds - These are a much larger asset class. They are very close to equity and therefore higher risk. They are first in line in terms of facing non-call and deferral risks. They are usually perpetual (no fixed maturity) but can have early redemption or call dates. Coupons are non-cumulative, so investors get nothing if the bank decides not to pay them. A missed coupon payment is not a default. Tier 1 is likely to become more important from a regulatory perspective. "We think regulators will want to see some form of non-common-equity Tier 1 surviving into the post-crisis future," CreditSights said. Credit rating agency Moody's Investors Service is working on changes to the way it rates lower quality subordinated debt. Standard & Poor's this week issued new criteria for rating Lower Tier 2 debt.
