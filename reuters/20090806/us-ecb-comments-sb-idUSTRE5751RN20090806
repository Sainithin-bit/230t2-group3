 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank is expected to keep interest rates on hold at a record low 1.0 percent on Thursday as it waits to see the impact of efforts so far to revive the economy and credit flows. 

 Below are highlights of ECB policymakers' comments since the Governing Council's July 2 policy meeting. To read full stories, double-click numbers in brackets. LUCAS PAPADEMOS (VICE PRESIDENT), JULY 29 "Policy interest rates could be raised if this is considered appropriate in the light of the outlook for price stability. An increase in policy interest rates could, but need not, coincide with the withdrawal of excess liquidity from the market." "The way in which we have injected liquidity into the economy makes it relatively easy, conceptually at least, to withdraw it in the future." "It is not possible to say with any degree of certainty when it will be appropriate to start draining liquidity... We will announce this to markets well in advance." "The potential growth rate of the euro area economy in the future is likely to be lower than in the past. Its value is surrounded by considerable uncertainty. This makes the decision about the timing of the implementation of an exit strategy more difficult. ATHANASIOS ORPHANIDES (CYPRUS), JULY 24 "Recent economic data and consumer research in the euro zone has registered the first positive signs of a more limited (in scope) reduction in economic activity for the rest of 2009 compared to the first quarter of the year." "Concerning prospects for 2010, after a period of stabilization, a gradual rebound is anticipated in the euro zone." "The expectation indicators for inflation continue to be anchored at levels compatible with the target of the ECB to maintain inflation below but close to 2 percent. JOSE MANUEL GONZALEZ-PARAMO (SPAIN), JULY 24 "We believe the interest rates are currently appropriate." "The monetary policy will change when the risk to price stability start to lessen and this has still not happened." "We've seen some signs that there has been a change in trend, but we've seen positive figures and not so positive figures, so we can't say the trend has changed." "Our growth forecasts remain for the middle of 2010 with positive growth figures for the euro system, though moderate. CHRISTIAN NOYER (FRANCE), JULY 22 "We must be aware that there remains a lot of uncertainty (on an economic recovery) and that we have to remain very cautious." On lending he added that "Globally, distribution of credit is not restricted unduly. MARIO DRAGHI (ITALY), JULY 21 "In Italy, the phase of the deterioration in the economy appears to have stopped, and we are starting to see some positive signs." "It still remains a priority to give support to the productive system. We need to avoid a structural weakening. EWALD NOWOTNY (AUSTRIA), JULY 21 "It is no secret that central banks' exit strategy, when the economic environment clearly improves, is to first drain liquidity and then as a second step, to also consider interest rate policy." "The ECB therefore has a clear exit strategy. But the moment for that has not yet come. VITOR CONSTANCIO (PORTUGAL), JULY 15 "The rates are appropriate." "Uncertainty about the economic development is still very high ... All problems are not sorted out. Of course we have to wait and be vigilant in what regards any new information. YVES MERSCH (LUXEMBOURG), JULY 14 "Market rates in the euro zone are very low by international standards." "One always has to keep in mind the negative effects of excessively low rates." "One can definitely question the extra effect of further interest rate cuts, when the level is already low." "We assume that we will only see positive quarterly growth rates in the middle of next year. This baseline scenario is surrounded by a lot of uncertainty. JOHN HURLEY (IRELAND), JULY 14 "Interest rates should stay at their existing level, they shouldn't increase until we see real signs of a sustained recovery. JEAN-CLAUDE TRICHET (PRESIDENT), JULY 13 "We see our policy rates as being appropriate and I would draw your attention to the fact that all that we do is committed to reducing the number of constraints." "The Governing Council will ensure that the measures taken are quickly unwound, and the liquidity provided is absorbed, once the macroeconomic environment improves. "In the euro area, the institutional frameworks provide such an anchor through the medium-term stability orientation of policies, with fiscal policies geared toward sustainability and a monetary policy geared toward price stability. In this environment, overly activist policies may risk destabilizing expectations, thereby being counterproductive." "Economic activity is expected to continue declining for the remainder of this year, but significantly less strongly than it did in the first quarter of 2009. Looking ahead into next year, following a period of stabilization, a gradual recovery with positive quarterly growth rates is expected by mid-2010.
