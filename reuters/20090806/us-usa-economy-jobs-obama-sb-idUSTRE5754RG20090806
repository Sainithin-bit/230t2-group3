 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - President Barack Obama still believes that the U.S. unemployment rate will eventually top 10 percent, the White House said on Thursday. 

 White House spokesman Robert Gibbs told reporters, however, he did not know whether the jobless rate would surpass the 10 percent mark in figures the government is due to release on Friday, though he said it was expected to show an increase.
