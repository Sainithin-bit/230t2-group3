 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank is expected to  leave its main interest rate at 1.0 percent on Thursday. 

 Following is a chronology of the ECB's interest rate moves since it took over responsibility for monetary policy in the euro zone on January 1, 1999. Each move is measured in basis points (bps), which are one hundredths of a percentage point. So 25 basis points equal 0.25 percentage point. Rate levels are in percentages.

The ECB said on October 8, 2008 it would stop auctioning off its weekly refinancing funds to the highest bidder, allocating them at a fixed main refinancing rate rather than at variable higher rates depending on demand. 2. Previously the ECB set benchmark interest rates for the euro zone by determining the minimum rate it will accept at the weekly refinancing operations. 3. The tenders are used to provide funds to the banking system over a one-week period to allow banks to meet their reserve requirements. The interest rate applied at the weekly operations is known as the refi rate and is the ECB's most important policy rate. (Editing by  David Stamp )
