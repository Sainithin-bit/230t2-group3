 STOCKHOLM  (Reuters) - Iceland needs to make progress on bank restructuring and build up a bigger buffer of currency reserves before it can removal capital controls, an IMF official said on Wednesday. 

 Franek Rozwadowski, the International Monetary Fund's resident representative in Iceland, told Reuters the banking and reserves issues accounted for two out of three conditions needed to lift the strict controls introduced after last year's crisis. A third condition, fiscal progress, was already in place. The interview came just before Icelandic officials were due to provide details on capital control plans after announcing last week a phased approach to lifting them. Removing controls is key to getting the island economy on a more normal footing. "The completion of the next IMF review will come with a tranche of funds, so that will put the buffer in place," Rozwadowski said in an interview by phone from Reykjavik. On the question of restructuring Iceland's banking sector, Rozwadowski said: "Negotiations on banks are underway now and it's a difficult and complex process, but certainly the objectives of the government are to have that substantially done later in the year."
