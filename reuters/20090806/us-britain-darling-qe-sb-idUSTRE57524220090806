 LONDON  (Reuters) - British finance minister Alistair Darling gave the Bank of England the go-ahead on Thursday to create an extra 25 billion pounds in new money to expand its quantitative easing programme, taking the total to 175 billion. 

 The government had sanctioned an initial 150 billion pounds in March when the scheme began. In a letter to BoE Governor Mervyn King, Darling said raising the limit would help the Monetary Policy Committee meet its 2 percent inflation target. "I agree that an increase in the ceiling would provide the MPC with scope to vary the stance of monetary policy to meet the inflation target," Darling said in the letter. "I am therefore writing to authorize an increase in the ceiling from 150 billion pounds to up to 175 billion pounds." "As we have discussed over the past month, we agree that the markets for commercial paper and for investment grade corporate bonds had improved considerably since the start of the year." "However, I welcome the development of a new APF facility for secured commercial paper to further assist the flow of credit to businesses."
