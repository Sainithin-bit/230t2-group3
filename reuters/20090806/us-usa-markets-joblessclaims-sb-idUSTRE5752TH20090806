 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The number of U.S. workers filing new claims for jobless benefits dropped more sharply-than-expected last week, a government report showed on Thursday, boosting views that the labor market and the economy were stabilizing. 

 KEY POINTS: * Initial claims for state unemployment insurance benefits fell 38,000 to a seasonally adjusted 550,000 in the week ended August 1 from 588,000 the prior week, the Labor Department said. * Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast new claims to edge down to 580,000 last week from a previously reported 584,000 count. * The number of people collecting long-term unemployment benefits rose by 69,000 to 6.31 million in the week ended July 25, the latest week for which the data is available. * The four-week moving average for new claims fell 4,750 to 555,250 in the week ended August 1. COMMENTS: PETER KENNY, MANAGING DIRECTOR, KNIGHT EQUITY MARKETS, JERSEY CITY, NEW JERSEY: "This number really is significant in that it's giving us an expectation that's tomorrow's much more significant number will be better than consensus. That could give this move a boost. "The number is also in conflict with yesterday's ISM number. After that, people were bracing themselves for a step back or maybe a pause, but this is saying no to that. It could speak to a better-than-expected number tomorrow." MARKET REACTION: STOCKS: U.S. stock index futures extend gains after jobless claims data. BONDS: U.S. Treasury debt prices slip. DOLLAR: U.S. dollar holds gains versus euro.
