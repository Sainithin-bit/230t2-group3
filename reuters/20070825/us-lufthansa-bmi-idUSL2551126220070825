 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Deutsche Lufthansa ( LHAG.DE ) is looking at the possibility of raising its stake in British carrier bmi BMID.UL, of which it already owns 30 percent minus one share, the German airline's Chief Executive Wolfgang Mayrhuber said. 

 "Bmi is an option," said Mayrhuber in extracts released on Saturday of an interview due to be published in business weekly Wirtschaftswoche on August 27. Scandinavian airline SAS AB ( SAS.ST ) is aiming to sell its 20 percent stake in bmi as it looks to focus on core operations. Sir Michael Bishop, chairman and founder of bmi, owns 50 percent of the airline plus one share. Bmi operates around 1,700 flights a week and holds around 12 percent of the takeoff and landing slots at London's Heathrow airport. Mayrhuber also said that Europe's airline industry needed consolidation but that maintaining a variety of brands was also essential.
