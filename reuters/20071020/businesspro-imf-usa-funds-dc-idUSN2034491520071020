 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - More participants will join a credit 
rescue plan that three lead banks are setting up to help 
stabilize the asset-backed commercial paper market, but it will 
be temporary, a senior U.S. Treasury official said on Saturday. 

  In prepared remarks for delivery to a panel session at the 
International Institute of Finance, Treasury's under secretary 
for domestic finance, Robert Steel, said Treasury had closely 
consulted U.S. and international regulators while it 
facilitated the banks' organization of the fund.  Its purpose is to help structured investment vehicles, or 
SIVs, avoid being forced into dumping mortgage assets that they 
hold at firesale prices by giving them a chance, for a fee, to 
offer them to a "superfund" set up by the banks.  "The structure they are developing is expected to be 
temporary and will serve as a bridge, which will provide time 
for participating SIVs to restructure in a more orderly 
fashion," Steel said.  Steel said setting up the fund, known as the Master 
Liquidity Enhancement Conduit, was complex and will take some 
time to complete.  The fund was announced last Monday by Citigroup ( C.N ), Bank 
of America Corp. ( BAC.N ) and JPMorgan Chase ( JPM.N ). Wachovia 
later said it too will participate.  "Initial progress is being made by the lead banks and 
participation is expected to broaden in the weeks ahead," Steel 
said. The three original banks indicated that as much as $80 
billion might be provided to start the fund.  Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, a Wall Street veteran 
before he took over Treasury last year, said he thought the 
fund could be up and running by year-end and stressed that it 
was intended to make sure the best assets of the SIVs become  available to investors and not to bail out bad assets.
