 ROME  (Reuters) - Italy still has no plans to ask to ask for European Union help to bring down its borrowing costs, the economy minister said on Thursday after the country sharply hiked its budget deficit forecasts for this year and next. 
 Vittorio Grilli was speaking at a press conference following the release of the new forecasts, which said Italy's recession in 2012 would be far deeper than previously expected. (Reporting by  Naomi O'Leary )
