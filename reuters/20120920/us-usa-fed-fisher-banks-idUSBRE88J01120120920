 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The financial system is "rigged" to benefit big banks, Dallas Federal Reserve Bank President Richard Fisher said on Wednesday, repeating his belief that the five largest U.S. banks should be broken up to protect the economy from another crisis. 
 Fisher, speaking at the Harvard Club of New York City, said big banks should not have a funding advantage over smaller, regional banks. He pointed, for example, to the interest that the Fed pays large banks for leaving their excess reserves at the U.S. central bank. (Reporting by  Jonathan Spicer ; Editing by Leslie Adler)
