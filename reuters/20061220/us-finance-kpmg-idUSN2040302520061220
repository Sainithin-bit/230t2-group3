 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The U.S. judge overseeing the KPMG criminal tax fraud case has set September 17 as a new trial date and said he was likely to reject a request by prosecutors to split the 18 defendants into two groups for trial. 

 Sixteen former KPMG KPMG.UL executives and two others are accused of helping cheat the government out of $2.5 billion by creating questionable tax shelters for wealthy clients. Last month, U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan in Manhattan indefinitely postponed the trial, which had been set to begin in January after a previous postponement, citing a dispute over who should pay the legal bills of KPMG employees. In a hearing on Wednesday, Kaplan said the government's request to break the case into two trials of nine defendants would be unwieldy. But the judge said he had not reached a final decision on the matter. He did not say when he would rule officially. "What I've been offered is to have two unmanageable trials instead of one," he said. "Might as well have one." If Kaplan rejects the government's request, it would be another blow to the prosecutors' case. In July, the judge ruled the government unconstitutionally pressured KPMG to withhold legal fees for its 16 former partners. The U.S. 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals is expected to rule soon on whether the district court judge or an outside arbitrator -- as requested by KPMG -- should decide who should pay the fees. Earlier this month, the U.S. Justice Department said it is revising policies for investigating business wrongdoing, saying prosecutors will not be able to consider payment of employees' legal bills -- except under rare circumstances -- when deciding whether a company should be charged with a crime. KPMG agreed in August 2005 to pay $456 million, accept an outside monitor and admit to wrongdoing in resolving a federal investigation into the shelters.
