 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Germany's MorphoSys ( MORG.DE ) said it 
could double its potential income from a collaboration with 
Pfizer ( PFE.N ) to more than $100 million after extending the 
agreement, sending MorphoSys shares higher on Wednesday. 

  Biotech company MorphoSys and Pfizer, the world's largest 
drugmaker, agreed to continue their cooperation on therapeutic 
antibodies until 2011. The agreement, signed in 2003, had been 
due to end in December 2008.  "The potential value for MorphoSys in research funding and 
potential developmental milestone payments increases to more 
than $100 million, not including royalties," MorphoSys said.  MorphoSys, which specializes in producing synthetic 
antibodies for medical research, added in a statement the 
extension also triggered a one-off payment from Pfizer. It did 
not disclose details.  By 1123 GMT, MorphoSys shares were up 7.2 percent to 51.65 
euros and were one of the top gainers in Germany's TecDAX 
technology index  .TECDAX , which rose 1.8 percent.  "This is very good news for MorphSys," said Equinet analyst 
Martin Possienke, adding that he considered the company's 
full-year forecasts to be very cautious in light of the one-off 
payment.  But MorphoSys finance chief Dave Lemus told Reuters the 
news did not merit an upgrade to its 2006 forecasts.  MorphoSys targets earnings before interest and tax of up to 
6 million euros ($7.9 million) this year on sales of up to 52 
million euros.  Under the extended agreement with Pfizer, MorphoSys said it 
would continue to generate therapeutic antibodies from its 
HuCAL GOLD library of human recombitant research antibodies 
against several new targets from Pfizer.  Pfizer would carry out preclinical and clinical development 
and market any resulting products, MorphoSys said.  MorphoSys works with many leading drugmakers including 
Novartis ( NOVN.VX ), Boehringer Ingelheim and Roche ( ROG.VX ). It 
is currently working on 41 antibody projects with 
pharmaceutical companies, beating its target of 38 by the end 
of the year.  Lemus declined to name a target for 2007, but said the 
company won an average of 10 new projects a year. "We are 
optimistic that growth will continue at the same rate," he 
said.
