 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - US Airways Group Inc. ( LCC.N ) said on Wednesday that creditors of Delta Air Lines Inc. DALRQ.PK have not endorsed Delta's reorganization plan as they continue to evaluate US Airways' proposal to acquire the airline. 

 US Airways said in a statement that "it will continue to work with Delta's Creditors' Committee as it evaluates the value created by our proposal compared with Delta's standalone plan."
