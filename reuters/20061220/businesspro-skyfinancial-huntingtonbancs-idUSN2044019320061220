 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. regional bank Huntington 
Bancshares Inc. ( HBAN.O ) said on Wednesday it would buy its 
Ohio neighbor Sky Financial Group Inc. SKYF.O for about $3.6 
billion in stock and cash to create a stronger presence in the 
U.S. Midwest. 

  The companies said the transaction values each share of Sky 
Financial Group at $30.22, a 25 percent premium to its closing 
price of $24.17 on December 19.  Huntington expects the transaction to immediately add to 
2007 earnings, excluding one-time charges, and to result in 
$115 million in annual cost savings.  "This merger is consistent with our conviction that 
Huntington can create shareholder value by participating in 
consolidation in the Midwest and lowering costs and increasing 
customer convenience," said Thomas Hoaglin, Huntington's 
chairman, president, and chief executive officer.  The combination would make Huntington the 24th-largest 
domestically controlled U.S. bank, Hoaglin said.  Sky Financial shareholders will receive 1.098 shares of 
Huntington stock, on a tax-free basis, and a taxable cash 
payment of $3.023 for each share of Sky Financial.
  SUCCESSION PLAN  Columbus-based Huntingdon had deposits of about $38 billion 
as of September 30 and has over 380 offices in Indiana, 
Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio, and West Virginia.  Bowling Green-based Sky Financial has operations in Ohio, 
Pennsylvania, Indiana, Michigan and West Virginia.  Upon closing, Hoaglin will remain chairman and chief 
executive officer and Sky Financial CEO Marty Adams will be 
appointed president and chief operating officer, reporting to 
Hoaglin.  However, under an employment agreement, Adams will become 
CEO and president on, or before, December 31, 2009, with 
Hoaglin remaining as chairman until early 2011, when he will 
retire.  After the merger, Huntington's board will have 15 members, 
with 10 from Huntington and five from Sky Financial.  The deal was unanimously approved by both companies' boards 
and is expected to close early in the third quarter of 2007, 
pending approval by regulators and shareholders of both 
companies.  Lehman Brothers Inc. and Bear, Stearns & Co. Inc. acted as 
financial advisors to Huntington. Sandler O'Neill & Partners, 
L.P. was financial adviser to Sky Financial Group.
