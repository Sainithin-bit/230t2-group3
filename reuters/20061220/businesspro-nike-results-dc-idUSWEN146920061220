 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Nike Inc. ( NKE.N ), the world's 
largest maker of athletic footwear and clothing, said on 
Wednesday that quarterly net profit rose nearly 8 percent, 
helped by a tax benefit and global sales growth. 

  Fiscal 2007 second-quarter net income rose to $325.6 
million, or $1.28 per share, compared with $301.1 million, or 
$1.14 per share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 10 percent in the 
quarter to $3.82 billion from $3.47, Nike said.  Wall Street analysts, on average, had been expecting the 
Beaverton, Oregon-based company to post earnings of $1.13 on a 
net and adjusted basis on revenue of $3.76 billion.  Earnings were boosted by 13 cents per share due to a tax 
agreement with the Dutch government that included a retroactive 
tax benefit.  Shares fell less than 1 percent in extended trade after 
closing at $99.78, up nearly 4 percent, on the New York Stock 
Exchange.  In the United States, Nike's No. 1 market, sales rose 8 
percent, while European sales rose 6 percent. In the 
Asia-Pacific region, sales rose 15 percent.  Forward orders for footwear and apparel scheduled for 
delivery from December through April 2007 rose 7 percent, Nike 
said in a statement.  Nike's introduction of lower-priced styles this year to 
meet demand abroad and in the United States has meant more 
promotions and more investment spending and has narrowed profit 
margins in recent quarters.  But in the second quarter, gross profit margins were 
relatively flat compared with a year earlier. Costs rose to 32 
percent of revenues compared to 30.4 percent in the year-ago 
period.  Nike, whose shares as of Wednesday's close have risen 16 
percent since January, is valued at 15 times 2008 earnings, at 
a premium to its main rivals, Germany's Adidas AG ADSG.DE and 
Puma ( PUMG.DE ), whose forward-looking price-to-earnings ratios 
are nearly 14 and 14.6, respectively.
