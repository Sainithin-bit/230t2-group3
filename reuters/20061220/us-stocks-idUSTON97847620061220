 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  finished at a record high on Tuesday, as a rise in oil prices boosted shares of Exxon Mobil Corp. ( XOM.N ) and investors thought a jump in an inflation gauge would not necessarily lead to increasing interest rates. 

 Gains were limited as technology stocks fell after disappointing financial results from industry bellwether Oracle Corp. ORCL.O. An unexpected quarterly loss from electronics retailer Circuit City CC.N sparked worries about retail store profits during the holiday shopping season. The Labor Department said the Producer Price Index, a key inflation measure, registered its biggest gain in 32 years. That initially sent stocks lower, but investors said they reassessed the data throughout the day. "People are positive that growth is fine and inflation is going to be under control," said Neil Massa, senior trader at John Hancock Funds in Boston. "Technology is pressured mainly by the negative headlines around earnings by some big technology companies. It's nothing to do with the overall environment." The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  was up 30.05 points, or 0.24 percent, to end at a record 12,471.32. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  was up 3.07 points, or 0.22 percent, to finish at 1,425.55. But the Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  was down 6.02 points, or 0.25 percent, to close at 2,429.55. The Dow hit an all-time high of 12,491.91 in intraday trading and achieved its 21st record close since the start of October. Shares of Oracle were the heaviest drag on the Nasdaq 100 .NDX after the database software maker reported disappointing sales late on Monday. Oracle shares fell 4.5 percent, or 81 cents, to $17.10. Circuit City reported an unexpected loss, sending its shares down 17.5 percent, or $4.04, to $19.01 on the New York Stock Exchange. Shares of rival Best Buy Co. Inc. ( BBY.N ) fell 1.6 percent, or 79 cents, to $48.55 and the S&P Retail Index .RLX was off 0.6 percent. Investors also were jittery after a steep drop in Thai stocks overnight after the government imposed capital controls to rein in its baht currency  THB= . The Thai government later withdrew its restrictions on foreign investment in its stock market. Exxon Mobil shares were up 2 percent, or $1.48, at $76.99 on the NYSE. U.S. crude oil for January delivery CLF7 rose 94 cents, or 1.5 percent, to settle at $63.15 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The rise in oil prices was attributed to expectations that U.S. crude inventories fell in the past week due to shipping delays along the coast of the Gulf of Mexico. U.S. oil inventory data will be released on Wednesday. Investment bank Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ) reported results that topped analysts' estimates and announced it will spin off its Discover credit card unit. Morgan Stanley's stock was up 1.7 percent, or $1.33, at $81.70 on the NYSE. Home builders' shares fell across the board after Hovnanian Enterprises Inc.( HOV.N ) posted a quarterly loss and gave a weak outlook, sending its stock down nearly 2 percent, or 69 cents, to $34.56. The Dow Jones U.S. Home Construction Index .DJUSHB fell 1.4 percent. Trading was active on the New York Stock Exchange, where about 1.57 billion shares changed hands, slightly below last year's daily average of 1.61 billion. On the Nasdaq, about 2.03 billion shares were traded, exceeding last year's daily average of 1.80 billion. Advancing shares beat decliners on the NYSE by a ratio of about 6 to 5, while on the Nasdaq, more than eight stocks fell for every seven that rose.
