 DETROIT  (Reuters) - CarMax Inc. ( KMX.N ), the largest U.S. retailer of used cars, posted a stronger-than-expected quarterly profit on Wednesday, and boosted its fiscal 2007 earnings outlook, sending its shares up nearly 13 percent. 

 Net income in the third quarter rose 98 percent to $45.4 million, or 42 cents a share, from $22.9 million, or 22 cents a share, a year earlier. The quarter included 3 cents a share in stock-based compensation costs. Analysts had expected 25 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. CarMax's profit almost doubled due to strong Internet traffic, a demand for luxury vehicles and a rebound in SUV and truck sales. CarMax shares were up 11 percent at $54 on the New York Stock Exchange, but off the early high of $55.19. Sales in the quarter rose 24 percent from last year to $1.77 billion, while sales in stores open at least a year increased 13 percent. Analysts had expected $1.63 billion. CarMax said it now expects 2007 earnings of $1.75 to $1.85 a share, including stock-based compensation expense. It also expects same-store, used-vehicle sales growth of 8 percent to 9 percent. It previously said it expected earnings of $1.55 to $1.65 a share and same-store, used-vehicle sales growth of 6 percent to 8 percent. "It is difficult to attribute our strong traffic flow to any single factor, as we believe a number of elements had a positive effect," Tom Folliard, CarMax's president and chief executive officer, said. "We believe one contributing factor was our increased Internet visibility resulting from recent improvements to carmax.com and the expansion of our Internet classified advertising."
