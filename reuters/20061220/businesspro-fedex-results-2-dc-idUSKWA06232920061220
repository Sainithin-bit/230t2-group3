 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - FedEx Corp. ( FDX.N ) on Wednesday 
reported better-than-expected net profit on higher revenue in 
almost all units, but forecast earnings in its fiscal third 
quarter below Wall Street estimates.  The package delivery company's shares fell more than 4 
percent in early trading as investors were disappointed by the 
company's outlook, but analysts said FedEx has a track record 
of issuing conservative forecasts.  "I am not surprised that they are being a bit conservative 
given the current economic environment," said Peter Smith, a 
transportation analyst at Morningstar. "This is a company that 
likes to underpromise and overdeliver."  Along with its main rival, United Parcel Service Inc. 
( UPS.N ), FedEx is seen as a bellwether of the U.S. economy, 
based on the simple premise that economic growth translates 
into more packages being sent, or less when the economy slows.  FedEx reported net income of $511 million, or $1.64 a 
share, for the fiscal second quarter that ended November 30, 
compared with $471 million, or $1.53 a share, a year earlier.  Wall Street analysts had expected $1.76 per share before 
one-time items.  FedEx said its new labor agreement with its pilots, and 
ratified by the pilots' union in mid-October, reduced earnings 
by about 25 cents a share.  "If you include the 25 cents a share from the pilots' 
agreement, they came in well above estimates," said 
Morningstar's Smith. "Altogether, it looks like a pretty good 
quarter."  The Memphis, Tennessee-based company said revenue at its 
express delivery unit FedEx Express rose 6 percent to $5.69 
billion from $5.37 billion, but its operating margin fell to 
8.8 percent from 8.9 percent.  Revenue at ground-delivery unit FedEx Ground rose 16 
percent to $1.52 billion from last year's $1.31 billion, while 
revenue at freight unit FedEx Freight was up 31 percent at 
$1.23 billion from $932 million.  FedEx Kinko's, however, continued to struggle, with revenue 
down 2 percent at $519 million compared with last year's figure 
of $528 million.  The company said it expects fiscal third-quarter earnings 
of $1.20 to $1.35 per share, well below analysts' average 
forecast of $1.54.  In a statement, however, Chief Executive Officer Fred Smith 
was upbeat on the company's performance during the important 
holiday season.  "Package volumes are solid this holiday season, and we see 
continued global economic growth in 2007," he said.  In early New York Stock Exchange trading, FedEx shares were 
down $3.89, or 3.41 percent, at $110.18.
