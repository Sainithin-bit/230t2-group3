 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Clorox Co. ( CLX.N ) said on Wednesday it will buy Colgate's ( CL.N ) bleach business in Latin America and Canada for $126 million and purchase inventory at cost, giving it additional brands while Colgate can continue to focus on its more its profitable products like toothpaste. 

 Clorox said the acquisition should cut 3 cents to 4 cents from its earnings per share in the second half of the current fiscal year. It expects the deal to be a modest drag on earnings for 12 months to 18 months as it works on the transition and tries to revitalize the brands. Shares of both companies rose modestly. The deal covers Colgate-Palmolive Co.'s bleach businesses in Canada, Colombia, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Uruguay and Venezuela. It includes the Javex brand in Canada, the Nevex brand in Venezuela and the Agua Jane brand in Uruguay. Colgate is also granting Clorox a license for the Ajax brand for bleach for a transition period in Colombia, the Dominican Republic and Ecuador. The deal should lead to improved gross profit margins in Colgate's Latin American and North American units, Colgate Chairman and Chief Executive Reuben Mark said in a statement. He also said that the divestiture should help Colgate focus on its more profitable oral and personal care businesses. Colgate expects the sales to result in a cumulative after tax gain of about $70 million, which will be offset by restructuring charges under a plan started in 2004. Clorox said that the brands should generate sales of about $77 million for the year ending December 31. It said that the brands involved are the leading brands in each country, except for Colombia, where Clorox already holds the top spot. Colgate said that the deal should close in Canada this month and close in Latin America during the first quarter of 2007, although the sale of the Colombian business will be subject to regulatory approval. As part of the deal, Clorox will acquire a manufacturing facility in Alberta, Canada and another in Venezuela, with employees at both sites transferring to Clorox. Shares of Oakland, California-based Clorox rose 18 cents to $63.79 while shares of New York-based Colgate rose 13 cents to $65.22.
