 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A U.S. bankruptcy court approved an 
agreement between Delta Air Lines Inc. and the federal pension 
insurer that allows the carrier to terminate its pilots' 
pension plan, a Delta spokesman said on Wednesday. 

  Delta DALRQ.PK, which rejected an $8.4-billion takeover 
bid by rival US Airways Group Inc. ( LCC.N ) on Tuesday, hopes to 
emerge from bankruptcy protection in the spring of next year as 
an independent carrier.  The court's decision, which comes over objections from a 
group of more than 800 retired pilots, brings the airline a 
step closer to meeting that goal.  The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. (PBGC), the federal 
agency that insures corporate pensions, will become trustee for 
the pilots' pension plan under the agreement.  In return, the PBGC will receive an unsecured claim of $2.2 
billion when Delta emerges from bankruptcy. Delta will also 
distribute $225 million in unsecured debt to the PBGC.  Termination of the plan would be retroactive to September 
2.  The airline has pledged to preserve pension accounts 
covering 90,000 nonunion workers and retirees, including flight 
attendants, when it steps out of court protection.
