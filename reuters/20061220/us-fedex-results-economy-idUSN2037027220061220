 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - The top executive at FedEx Corp. ( FDX.N ) said on Wednesday he sees healthy global economic growth over the next six months, particularly in Asia. 

 In a conference call to discuss the package delivery company's quarterly results, Fred Smith, FedEx chairman and chief executive, said he expects U.S. economic growth to be a little slower over the next six months, in part because of the slowdown in the housing industry. The Memphis, Tennessee-based company reported lower-than-expected quarterly profit and forecast earnings in the current period below Wall Street estimates.
