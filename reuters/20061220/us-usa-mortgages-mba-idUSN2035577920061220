 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. mortgage applications slumped last week, pulled down by a plunge in home refinancing loan demand as interest rates climbed from recent lows, an industry trade group said on Wednesday. 

 The Mortgage Bankers Association said its seasonally adjusted index of mortgage application activity USMGM=ECI, which includes both refinancing and purchasing loans, for the week ended December 15 tumbled 10.2 percent to 647.6 from the previous week's 721.2, its highest level in over a year. Applications were 8.9 percent above their year-ago level. Douglas Duncan, chief economist at MBA, said the indexes tend to be volatile, but higher interest rates played a large role in the drop in demand. "You did see a little bit of a rate reversal last week," he said. "The people right now who are taking out loans are real opportunists." Subprime mortgage holders are particularly rate sensitive and "jump in" whenever rates fall, Duncan said, as they did earlier this month when rates hit a recent low. Classified as riskier borrowers, subprime mortgageholders pay higher mortgage rates. Overall borrowing costs on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages, excluding fees, averaged 6.10 percent, up 0.08 percentage point from the previous week. Two weeks ago, 30-year mortgage rates fell to 5.98 percent, the lowest level since October 2005. But interest rates were below year-ago levels of 6.22 percent. Demand for home purchase loans also weakened as the MBA's seasonally adjusted purchase index USMGPI=ECI, widely considered a timely gauge of U.S. home sales, fell 5.9 percent to 436.5. The index was also 3.7 percent below its year-ago level of 453.1. REFINANCINGS SLUMP Driving the fall in mortgage demand last week was a 14.6 percent slide in the MBA's seasonally adjusted index of refinancing applications USMGR=ECI to 1,968.8. However, that reading was still up 38.8 percent from a year ago when the index stood at 1,418.1. The refinance share of applications decreased to 50.8 percent from 52.6 percent the previous week. Despite last week's decline, there has been a large appetite for home loan refinancing in recent weeks, particularly by the riskiest borrowers who have subprime adjustable-rate mortgages, said Duncan. "The subprime folks are going to jump in whenever they get an incremental improvement in rates," he said. "They are the folks who are the most cash conscious and so with those incremental improvements in rates, they were able to either leverage further down on an adjustable-rate or jump to a fixed-rate." ADJUSTABLE RATES In the past, adjustable-rate mortgages, known as ARMs, have been a refuge for cash-strapped consumers seeking to buy a home with low initial mortgage payments. But the borrowing costs for some fixed- and floating-rate loan types were the same last week. Fixed 15-year mortgage rates averaged 5.82 percent, up from 5.75 percent. Rates on one-year ARMs increased to 5.82 percent from 5.76 percent. The ARM share of activity decreased to 23.6 percent of total applications from 24.9 percent the previous week, its lowest since October 2003. U.S. housing industry indexes, in general, tend to be volatile and in recent months they have painted a mixed picture, with some pointing to weakening and others to stabilization. The MBA's survey covers about 50 percent of all U.S. retail residential loans. Respondents include mortgage banks, commercial banks and thrifts.
