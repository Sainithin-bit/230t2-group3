 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Pepsi Bottling Group Inc. PBG.N forecast 2007 earnings below Wall Street expectations on Wednesday, citing slowing sales volume in the United States and higher costs for raw materials such as aluminum, sweetener and drink concentrate, sending shares down 1.4 percent in morning trading. 

 The largest bottler of Pepsi drinks said it expects to earn $1.92 to $2 per share in 2007, excluding the potential effect of a change in accounting for uncertain tax provisions. Analysts, on average, expected $2.05 per share, excluding items, according to Reuters Estimates. Pepsi Bottling said it expects operating profit to rise 2 percent to 4 percent during the year, with sales by volume seen increasing 1 percent to 2 percent worldwide and flat to up 1 percent in the U.S. The company said it expects its cost of goods sold to increase 6 percent next year, from price increases on the concentrate it buys from PepsiCo Inc. ( PEP.N ), soaring prices for corn, which is used to make the sweetener high-fructose corn syrup, and aluminum. "We're facing some of the most daunting cost pressures we've seen in recent memory," said Chief Executive Eric Foss on a conference call with analysts. "These pressures are going to have a very real impact on our results and so our guidance appropriately reflects this challenge." Foss said the company is planning to achieve a 4 percent increase in net revenue per case in 2007, with 80 percent of that coming from price increases the company implemented after Labor Day and new increases it plans to make in some markets after the American football Super Bowl in February. J.P. Morgan analyst John Faucher said the new forecast meant that 2007 estimates would likely come down and that the stock likely would be weak. Goldman Sachs analyst Judy Hong said the guidance would also likely be a negative catalyst for bottling stocks. "The company's flat-to-up-1-percent volume forecast for the United States confirms our concerns that the carbonated soft drink segment will incur further declines in 2007 as secular softness is likely exacerbated by above-average price increases," Hong wrote in a research note. Pepsi Bottling shares were down 45 cents at $31.20 on the New York Stock Exchange.
