 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Communications 
Commission approved a plan on Wednesday to shorten the time it 
takes for companies like AT&T Inc. ( T.N ) and Verizon 
Communications Inc. ( VZ.N ) to get into the subscription 
television business. 

  The FCC approved by a 3-2 vote a plan limiting local 
authorities to 90 days to act on applications by new television 
providers which already have access to city land to run 
connections, and 180 days for new entrants to cities and towns.  AT&T and Verizon have complained that the process to get 
licenses from local authorities is too cumbersome and 
time-consuming. They tried to get similar relief from Congress 
but lawmakers failed to pass legislation this year.  The telephone carriers see offering television as a 
necessary component to their bundle of communications services 
to better compete against cable operators, which now offer 
their own telephone and high-speed Internet services.  Some at the FCC see new entrants into the television 
business as a way to hold down cable prices, which have 
outpaced inflation.  "Cable competition can make a difference and can impact 
cable bills," said FCC Chairman Kevin Martin.  States like Texas and California have already passed laws 
permitting telephone companies to get statewide licenses on the 
condition they pay a portion of their video revenue to local 
authorities to cover the usage of public rights-of-way, as 
cable companies do.  The FCC said its action would not preempt state legislation 
aimed at speeding consideration of license applications.  The FCC decision could be challenged in court. State and 
local officials have questioned the need for FCC action and 
whether the commissioners have the authority to act.
