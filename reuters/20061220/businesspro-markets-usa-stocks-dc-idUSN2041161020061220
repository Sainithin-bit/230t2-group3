 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Stocks edged lower on Wednesday in 
light trading as a disappointing outlook from FedEx Corp. 
pulled down transport stocks and offset the positive influence 
of the latest round of proposed takeovers. 

  Shares of FedEx fell 1.9 percent, or $2.20, to $111.85. The 
descent of FedEx's stock dragged down the shares of rivals such 
as United Parcel Service Inc. and pressured the Standard & 
Poor's 500 Index after the package delivery company reported a 
third-quarter earnings forecast that fell below Wall Street's 
estimates.  "For most of these stocks, the fundamentals aren't looking 
very positive right now," said Thomas Leritz, manager of Argent 
Capital Management's capgoods and transportation portfolio.  On the M&A front, the latest deal involved Ericsson AB, the 
Swedish telecommunications equipment maker, which offered to 
buy Redback Networks Inc., a networking equipment vendor, for 
$2.1 billion in cash. The offer came after about $100 billion 
of proposed deals had been announced this week worldwide.  "There have been a lot of takeovers and with Redback today, 
it's adding to the excitement," said Steve Goldman, a market 
strategist with Weeden & Co. in Greenwich, Connecticut.  But he added that what had been broad-based gains were 
narrowing as investors concentrate on large multinational names 
whose profits will hold up better amid the slowing economy.  The dollar weakened this week, lifting shares of 3M Co. and 
General Electric Co.on Wednesday. These blue chips are among 
global companies that benefit from the anemic dollar as it 
usually stimulates overseas sales. The U.S. currency has 
dropped nearly 2 percent against the euro since the last week 
of November.  The Dow Jones industrial average dipped 7.45 points, or 
0.06 percent, to end at 12,463.87, while the Standard & Poor's 
500 Index edged down 2.02 points, or 0.14 percent, to finish at 
1,423.53. The Nasdaq Composite Index fell 1.94 points, or 0.08 
percent, to close at 2,427.61.
  DOW'S INTRADAY RECORD NEAR 12,500  Earlier, the Dow hit an intraday record high of 12,498.47. 
On Tuesday, the blue-chip Dow average had closed at its 21st 
record high since the start of October.  Traders said Wednesday's light volume will wane even 
further as the week progresses and more market participants 
start their holiday weekend.  GE rose 0.4 percent, or 14 cents, to $38.15 and 3M was up 
0.9 percent, or 72 cents, to $78.83 on the New York Stock 
Exchange. These stocks were among the Dow's major gainers and 
helped limit its decline. GE ranked No. 3 among the S&P 500's 
top advancers and helped curb its loss for the day.  Shares of Maxim Integrated Products Inc. rose 4.4 percent, 
or $1.32, to $31.52 and topped the Nasdaq 100's advancers.  Maxim's gain helped keep the Nasdaq's loss for the day to 
just under 2 points after the chip maker said its founder and 
chief executive will retire on January 1 for health reasons. 
Maxim is among the companies whose stock option grants and 
practices have been under federal investigation.
  HEAVY CRUDE AND TRANSPORTS  Exxon Mobil Corp. fell 1.2 percent, or 91 cents, to $76.08 
on the NYSE. The stock was the biggest drag on both the Dow and 
the S&P 500 as investors locked in profits following a strong 
session a day earlier.  The Dow Jones Transportation Average fell 1.1 percent. The 
DJT average took a hit when FedEx shares fell, but it also was 
bogged down by a slide of 1.3 percent, or 98 cents, in United 
Parcel Service Inc. shares to $74.77.  Also weighing on the Dow Jones transports was the stock of 
railroad Norfolk Southern Corp., down 3.7 percent, or $1.87, at 
$49.28 on the NYSE. The railroad company's stock fell after a 
senior executive said Norfolk Southern's intermodal and 
automotive businesses faced a challenging fourth quarter.  Trading was moderate on the New York Stock Exchange, where 
about 1.38 billion shares changed hands, below last year's 
daily average of 1.61 billion.  On the Nasdaq, about 1.82 billion shares were traded, 
slightly below last year's daily average of 1.80 billion.  Advancing shares beat decliners on the NYSE by a ratio of 
about 5 to 4, while on the Nasdaq, more than five stocks rose 
for every four that fell.  (Additional reporting by  Nick Carey  in Chicago)
