 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - NYSE Group Inc. NYX.N shareholders on Wednesday approved a $14 billion plan to merge the New York Stock Exchange with Paris-based Euronext, a major step in the Big Board's drive to become global. 

 Shareholders gave overwhelming approval for the deal, and NYSE Chief Executive John Thain said Asia is the next logical place for the Big Board to expand. Thain, speaking at NYSE Group's annual meeting, said opportunities exist for deals to expand in Asian countries such as China. These transactions need not be acquisitions, he said. NYSE approval clears the way for combining the multinational European exchange operator with the largest U.S. stock exchange, forming the first transatlantic bourse. Euronext shareholders approved the plan on Tuesday. The combination poses an alternative to the London Stock Exchange, which has rejected attempts to be acquired by Nasdaq. NYSE Euronext will have a combined market capitalization of about $27 billion. NYSE Group Chairman Marshall Carter told reporters after the annual meeting that companies do not have to come to New York to raise capital because they can do that in Asia. He also said NYSE Group is well along in a multiple-step process transforming the former non-profit into a diversified, multi-asset exchange that is now in globalization mode. Investors like the strategy. NYSE Group shares have doubled in price this year. About 99.7 percent of NYSE Group shareholders who voted approved the proposed combination with Euronext, according to preliminary results. More than 75 percent of eligible shares were voted. Remaining hurdles for the Euronext deal include definitive approvals by European market regulators and the Dutch Finance Ministry, and approvals by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and French authorities.
