 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. stocks were little changed on Wednesday in light volume after early buying on the latest round of global mergers and acquisitions was offset by selling of transportation stocks. 

 A major takeover involved Ericsson AB ( ERIC.O ), the Swedish telecommunications equipment maker, which offered to buy Redback Networks Inc. RBAK.O, a networking equipment vendor, for $2.1 billion in cash. The offer came after about $100 billion of deals announced this week worldwide. "General optimism in the marketplace right now has been driven by mergers and acquisitions activity," said Giri Cherukuri, head trader with Oakbrook Investments in Lisle, Illinois. But dragging the S&P 500 index lower was the stock of FedEx Corp. ( FDX.N ), down 2.3 percent at $111.40 after it reported an earnings forecast for the third quarter below Wall Street's estimates. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  was up 7.93 points, or 0.06 percent, at 12,479.25. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  was down 0.65 point, or 0.05 percent, at 1,424.90. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  was down 0.06 point, or 0.00 percent, at 2,429.49. Shares of FedEx rival United Parcel Service Inc. ( UPS.N ) fell 1.4 percent to $74.70 and also ranked among the heaviest weights on the S&P 500. "As we get to the end of the week volume starts to dry up," said Sal Arnuk, co-manager of trading at Themis Trading in Chatham, New Jersey. Company ( F.N ). Redback shares shot up 18.5 percent to $25.09 after Ericsson's proposed takeover. The Dow Jones Transportation Average .DJT fell 1.1 percent, hurt by FedEx and UPS, but also by a 3.4 percent drop in the shares of railroad Norfolk Southern Corp. ( NSC.N ) after a senior executive said the company's intermodal and automotive businesses faced a challenging fourth quarter. Norfolk Southern was last at $49.39. The dollar weakened this week, lifting shares of companies such as 3M Co. ( MMM.N ) and General Electric Co. ( GE.N ). The companies' foreign profits will be boosted when translated into dollars after the U.S. currency fell nearly 2 percent against the euro since the last week of November. GE rose 0.6 percent to $38.23 and 3M was up 1.2 percent to $79.02. The Dow hit a record of 12,498.47 in intraday trading on Wednesday, after closing on Tuesday at its 21st record high since the start of October. Ford Motor was upgraded by a third brokerage in recent days. Key Banc raised its rating, pushing Ford shares up 1.1 percent to $7.26. Shares of Maxim Integrated Products Inc. ( MXIM.O ) rose 5.6 percent $31.89 and topped the Nasdaq 100's advancers. The chip maker said its founder and chief executive will retire on January 1 for health reasons. Maxim is among the companies whose stock option grants and practices have been under investigation.
