 LONDON  (Reuters) - Wall Street's big banks are moving beyond using UK home loans to back debt market business to increasingly originate their own mortgages, aiming to grab a bigger slice of the buoyant British housing market. 

 UK lender Kensington KGN.L recently said the arrival of more investment banks as providers of non-traditional mortgages had put pressure on margins, and the trend looks set to continue for sub-prime and buy-to-let home loans. By originating their own mortgages, Lehman Brothers LEH.N, Bear Stearns BSC.N and other banks make loans that can then be packaged into bonds, issued and traded through their structured finance desk. The firms say their top-to-bottom integration offers wider profit margins and better insight into mortgage markets and they can adjust risk accordingly. Such is the market's appeal that residential mortgages have become one of the big areas investment banks are committing resources to, and Britain is attracting much of it. "The investment banks have been looking at the UK partly because of the success of people like Lehman Brothers who have been in it for a while, but also because the market is more buoyant than in the U.S. at the moment and people see it as a springboard into Europe," said Simon Hinshelwood, managing director of Lehman's European mortgage capital division. Analysts agree the trend was well set. "I think it will continue. It's about feeding the machine, if you can guarantee a supply of mortgages then you can guarantee the issuance of mortgages," said David Williams, bank analyst at Morgan Stanley. "You also have a chance for much greater innovation if you are operating across the chain than if you are purely reliant on what business you can win and what business people bring to you," he added, saying banks can originate loans with a particular financial characteristic to suit demand for a type of mortgage-backed security. The market's buoyant state could be good news for home buyers as well. At a time when record personal insolvencies are leaving more of the population with bad credit history and as first-time buyers are in danger of being priced out of the market, a more innovative approach to those borrowers could mean more can get loans. NON-TRADITIONAL, BUT BOOMING Lehman ranks as about the third biggest provider of specialist mortgages in Britain, after buying Southern Pacific Mortgage Ltd (SPML) in 2002, adding Preferred Mortgages, and then buying London Mortgage Co. (LMC) earlier this year. In the past year Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ) has bought Advantage Home Loans, Merrill Lynch MER.N bought Freedom to join its existing MPLC business and Deutsche Bank ( DBKGn.DE ) launched DB Mortgages, all in the specialist UK mortgage space. The mortgages are typically sold through independent financial advisors, where technology enhancements in recent years have streamlined the process between lender and homebuyer. Banks have also beefed up their securitisation books with other deals, another trend seen continuing. Lehman is buying non-traditional loans originated by Alliance & Leicester AL.L and may soon start a similar arrangement with Northern Rock NRK.L, while Merrill is a backer for new specialty lender Edeus. Britain's housing market has defied predictions of a slowdown and prices are expected to grow about 10 percent this year, according to the latest survey by mortgage lender Halifax HBOS.L, with non-conforming mortgages growing even faster. Specialist mortgages offer greater margins than traditional home loans and are estimated to account for a quarter of new lending, or over 75 billion pounds ($147.8 billion) a year. As a result, investment banks are not alone in targeting the sector, and retail banks, building societies and other lenders have all stepped up their interest in non-traditional mortgages, which has shaved margins and added costs for experienced staff. "I see no easing of competition, but to a certain extent supply in this sector helps to push demand so the fact there's a lot of noise around the sector increases consumer awareness, which is a good thing," Lehman's Hinshelwood said.
