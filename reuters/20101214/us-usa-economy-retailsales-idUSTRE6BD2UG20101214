 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Sales at retailers rose more than expected in November, more evidence the economic recovery gathered steam in the fourth quarter. 

 PRODUCER PRICE INDEX: Producer prices rose more than expected in November as energy prices spiked, but underlying inflation pressures remained subdued, according to Labor Department data released on Tuesday. KEY POINTS: * The Commerce Department said on Tuesday total retail sales increased 0.8 percent, advancing for a fifth straight month. Sales for October were revised up to 1.7 percent from a previously reported 1.2 percent gain. * Economists polled by Reuters had expected retail sales to increase 0.6 percent last month. Compared to November last year sales were up 7.7 percent. * Excluding autos, sales rose 1.2 percent last, exceeding economists' expectations for a 0.6 percent gain. Sales excluding autos increased 0.8 percent in October. * The producer price index, a measure of business costs, rose 0.8 percent last month, above forecasts for a 0.6 percent gain in a Reuters poll. Compared to the same month a year earlier, the PPI climbed a robust 3.5 percent. COMMENTS: STEVEN WOOD, CHIEF ECONOMIST, INSIGHT ECONOMICS, DANVILLE, CALIFORNIA: "The PPI jumped in November, primarily because of higher prices for energy, food, and automobiles. Headline producer inflation rose for the thirteenth consecutive month on a year-on-year basis after declining in the previous 11 months. The overall PPI is 3.5 percent above its year ago level, little changed from its year-on-year rate over the past 5 months. The core PPI rose moderately in November after falling sharply in October. Core producer inflation remains subdued on a year-on-year basis although it has trended slightly higher over the past 6 months. Subdued core producer inflation reflect a lagged response to the relatively low level of manufacturing activity (despite the recent recovery in the factory sector)." TOM PORCELLI, CHIEF US ECONOMIST, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS, NEW YORK: "Very solid. There is no other way to describe the retails sales report. Based on this report we have upwardly revised our Q4 personal consumer spending numbers. Not only were the headline numbers impressive, but the upward revisions for the prior months. The notable decline was in electronics, but that has more to do with discounting than anything else. Judging by this report the hand-off to 2011 looks very promising." STEVE GOLDMAN, MARKET STRATEGIST, WEEDEN & CO, GREENWICH, CONNECTICUT: "The data was better, the revisions were better as well. Up to about a week ago there was some vast outperformance out of the retail stocks that things would be better looking at the holiday season and you're seeing this come to the headline news now." "Offsetting that though you're seeing some weakness prior to this coming from Best Buy and their forecast. Their stock is trading down 10 percent." "We're up sharply this month, we up at yesterday's high 9 percent for the quarter already. It's a little tough to get too, too excited." DAVID ADER, HEAD OF GOVERNMENT BOND STRATEGY, CRT CAPITAL GROUP, NEW YORK: "The retail sales figure will drive GDP forecasts up about 0.5%, so a strong figure. The market is, however, trading a bit better led by the belly. This is ironic given the Retail sales data. Still, it's an interesting behavior and one of the first times in weeks the market has behaved well vs. strong data. We'll see if it lasts."
