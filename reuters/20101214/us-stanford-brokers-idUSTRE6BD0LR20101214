 HOUSTON  (Reuters) - U.S. regulators have notified some brokers who worked for indicted financier Allen Stanford that they may face civil fraud charges, the Financial Times reported on Monday. 

 Former Stanford brokers Danny Bogar and Patrick Cruickshank have received Wells notices from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, a process intended to notify individuals of possible civil charges, the newspaper reported. A message left with Bogar was not immediately returned and Cruickshank could not be reached. Lawyers for the men said their clients had no knowledge of the $7 billion Ponzi scheme prosecutors allege was led by Stanford, according to the newspaper. Documents filed with industry regulator Financial Industry Regulatory Authority show Cruickshank received a Wells notice from the SEC earlier this year. A spokesman for the SEC could not immediately be reached for comment. Stanford, who is currently in jail awaiting a January trial, has denied any wrongdoing. He faces civil and criminal charges related to the scheme, which centered around his bank in Antigua. (Reporting by  Anna Driver  in Houston; editing by  Andre Grenon )
