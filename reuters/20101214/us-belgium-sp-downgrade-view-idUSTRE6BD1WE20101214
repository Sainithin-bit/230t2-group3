 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - Standard & Poor's rating agency said on Tuesday Belgium's sovereign debt could be downgraded within six months if its inability to form a new government persists and its debt trajectory worsens. 

 The agency added that it had concerns about Belgium's general fiscal outlook, and specifically its target of reducing its budget deficit to 4.1 percent of GDP next year. The statement followed a downgrading of Belgium's outlook to 'negative', while its rating of AA+/A-1+ was maintained. ANALYSTS' AND ECONOMISTS' COMMENTS NICK KOUNIS, ECONOMIST ABN AMRO "I think the key issue when it comes to Belgium, in contrast to most other euro zone countries, is they don't really have a serious fiscal consolidation package in place and obviously there's the political uncertainty and how that relates to whether they will put in place a consolidation package. "The deficit doesn't look that bad, but of course the government debt levels are high and at the moment it enjoys the benefit of low interest rates and low debt service costs. But of course there is the contagion risk in what is still quite a vulnerable environment in terms of the sovereign debt crisis. "I imagine whether they go ahead with it (an S&P downgrade of Belgium) or not really depends on whether we get government action in terms of consolidation."
