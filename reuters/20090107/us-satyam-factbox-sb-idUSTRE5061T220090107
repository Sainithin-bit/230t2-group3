 BANGALORE  (Reuters) - The chairman of Satyam Computer Services, India's 4th-biggest software services exporter, announced his resignation on Wednesday, saying the company's recent profits had been overstated.

Ramalinga Raju, who was born into a family of farmers and is a Management graduate from Ohio University. * Satyam debuted on the Indian markets in 1991, followed by a listing in New York in 2001. Last year, it launched a secondary listing on Euronext Amsterdam under NYSE Euronext's new "fast path" process for cross-listings in New York and Europe. * Satyam, whose clients include General Electric, Nestle, Qantas and Fujitsu, specializes in business software, and offers back-office outsourcing and consulting services. * In the year to end-March 2008, Satyam posted a 46.3 percent rise in revenue to $2.1 billion under U.S. accounting standards, while net income rose 39.7 percent to $417 million.
