 (Reuters) - Bank of America sold a 2.5 percent stake in China Construction Bank on Wednesday, earning a profit of about $1.13 billion and leaving it with a 16.6 percent stake in the state-controlled Chinese lender. 

 The move follows close on UBS' sale late last year of its stake in Bank of China. With western banks squeezed by the global financial crisis, those with stakes in Chinese lenders are under pressure to sell out in order to raise much-needed cash. Below is a list of major foreign financial group holdings in Chinese banks, and the overall market value of each bank. 1. ICBC Market cap: $181.7 bln - Goldman Sachs: 4.9 pct - Allianz Group: 1.9 pct - American Express: 0.4 pct 2. China Construction Bank $134.2 bln - Bank of America: 16.60 pct - Temasek: 5.04 pct 3. Bank of China $101.3 bln - Royal Bank of Scotland China Investment^: 8.25 pct - Temasek: 4.13 pct - Asian Development Bank: 0.2 pct 4. Bank of Communications $37.9 bln - HSBC: 19.15 pct Note:  The Royal Bank of Scotland Group owns RBS China 51.6 percent, so indirectly owns about 4.26 percent of Bank of China.
