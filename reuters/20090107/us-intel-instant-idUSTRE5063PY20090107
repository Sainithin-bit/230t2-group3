 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Leading U.S. semiconductor maker Intel Corp warned that its fourth-quarter revenue would lag expectations, further slashing estimates that it had already cut once in November. 

 Intel shares were down 78 cents, or 5.1 percent at $14.59 in early trading on the Nasdaq. The following is reaction from industry analysts and investors: KIM CAUGHEY, SENIOR ANALYST, FORT PITT CAPITAL GROUP, IN PITTSBURGH, WHICH MANAGES ABOUT $800 MILLION. THE FIRM DOES NOT HOLD INTEL SHARES "It's not a huge surprise. In their mid-quarter update they had said it was soft. Over the past couple of days I have seen a lot of sell side analysts bringing down their expectations for the PC-oriented part of technology." "Intel is probably still well positioned, given their strong balance sheet." "Intel has seen this too. They've taken some steps in the recent past to skinny down expenses." "It shows that IT departments are being very careful with their dollars. We would still expect purchasing to go on. I don't think it's going to go to zero." "PCs are kind of nodes. They are out at the end of the chain. it looks like money is still being spent on the data center." "The contracts that companies like CA, BMC and IBM write for businesses span several years, so it's annuity spending. Just because things are getting bad, it doesn't mean you can get out of those contracts. Anybody who has an annuity like revenues would probably be a good place to look for tech value at this point." TIM GHRISKEY, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, SOLARIS ASSET MANAGEMENT, IN BEDFORD HILLS, NEW YORK, WHICH MANAGES ABOUT $2 BILLION, "Clearly we are going to be in an ugly period for corporate earnings. That shouldn't be a surprise to anybody. "I think we are going to see announcements like this throughout the earnings season and this preannouncement period. Especially this preannouncement period. "It makes these next two weeks particularly risky on an individual stock basis. "Clear Intel being a bellwether for the industry it will take the industry down as well. "Technology purchases by corporations have been significantly curtailed, at least for the early part of this year. Companies are making due with what they have." FRANCIS CAMPEAU, BROKER AT MF GLOBAL CANADA, IN MONTREAL: "There is still a lack of visibility. When these guys are running very large corporations and they have a hard time hitting that target for sales, it tells you the market is still on very shaky ground." "It means the market is harder to predict, so volatility might bounce back a bit and the Santa Clause rally may fade today. Forward guidance is still very tough to make." WALTER TODD, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, GREENWOOD CAPITAL ASSOCIATES, GREENWOOD, SOUTH CAROLINA, WHICH OWNS INTEL SHARES: "If you are surprised by this news, then you've been on a desert island. We all know the economy is weak. If you're holding Intel today, it's not on the expectation they'll have a great 2009. If you're holding them today it's because this is a leading industry player with a great balance sheet and longer-term it will really look great. But 2009 for Intel and others in technology, and outside of technology, will be a very rough earnings year." BEN WALLACE, SECURITIES ANALYST, GRIMES & COMPANY, WESTBOROUGH, MASSACHUSETTS "The great thing that we're looking at with technology in general is that on the one hand you have the slowing demand, slowing fundamentals, but on the other hand compared to where we were eight years ago you don't have any of the valuation issues." "My sense is that people aren't really surprised by slowing revenue, slowing profits right now." "We don't spend a lot of time worrying about the balance sheets of these companies, we think there's the ability to hang in there." "The fact that technology is slowing is not a shock to anyone... but two warnings in one quarter isn't the best thing -- it speaks to the speed at which things have slowed."
