 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Manufacturing conglomerate ITT Corp. ( ITT.N ) on Friday reported lower net profit due to the sale of some businesses, but beat Wall Street estimates and raised its full-year forecast on strong sales of its defense and water treatment products. 

 The company, which makes a range of products including night vision equipment, military radios and sewage treatment equipment, reported net profit of $140 million, or 76 cents per share, compared with $155.9 million, or 83 cents per share, a year earlier. Sales rose in each its three operating areas -- fluid technology, defense, and flow control products -- but ITT said profit was cut by the sale of pump and fluid handling businesses last year. Profit beat Wall Street's average forecast of 69 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Sales rose 15.6 percent to $2.1 billion, ahead of analysts' average estimate of $1.9 billion. For the full year, ITT raised its sales forecast by $170 million to about $8.5 billion. Wall Street is expecting $8.4 billion, on average. It now expects earnings, excluding special items, in the range of $3.44 to $3.50 per share for the full year. Analysts are expecting $3.38 per share, on average.
