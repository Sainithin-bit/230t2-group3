 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Tyson Foods Inc. ( TSN.N ), the 
world's largest chicken, beef and pork processor, said on 
Friday it would soon resume beef exports to South Korea, whose 
market has been closed to U.S. beef for over three years. 

  "Tyson Foods has decided to resume beef exports to South 
Korea. We currently anticipate beginning shipments within the 
next few weeks," Gary Mickelson, a company spokesman, said in 
an e-mail.  The news came the same day that South Korea accepted a 
shipment of 6.4 tonnes of U.S. beef, a first since December 
2003, and another shipment was in the works. That beef was from 
Creekstone Farms, a Kansas-based company.  The move was welcomed by U.S. beef interests, but industry 
officials and politicians said Seoul must accept more U.S. 
beef, and do so regularly, before they will support a lucrative 
bilateral trade deal that has yet to be approved by Congress.
