 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A strong euro is a sign of a robust European economy and not a cause for concern, European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso said on Friday. 

 "We don't consider the euro too strong," Barroso told reporters following a speech at the New York Stock Exchange, "A strong currency is a good thing, it's a signal of confidence in the European economy." The euro has been steadily gaining on the U.S. dollar and hit a record high of $1.3683 earlier on Friday. Though a strong currency can make exports more expensive, Barroso said the euro's climb against the dollar has yet to dent exports from Germany, the euro zone's biggest country. He said the euro's track record since its introduction in 1999 has been a positive one, adding that it has fostered fiscal discipline, enhanced price stability and helped control the rate of inflation in the 13-country euro zone. More important than exchange rates, he said, are the effort countries undertake to right global imbalances between states that spend too much and those that are excessive savers. ENGINE OF GLOBAL GROWTH During his speech, Barroso said the trans-Atlantic economy anchored by the European Union and United States is the "engine of global growth" and is indispensable to global prosperity. "Without the trans-Atlantic economy, we have no future," he said. Among the biggest threats to it, he added, are urges to restrict free trade and investment on both sides of the Atlantic. "Sometimes there are calls for protectionism. I really hope those who want open economies on both sides have the courage" to resist such measures, he said. He also stressed the importance of EU relations with Turkey, adding that Turkey's eventual accession to the union would help dispel fears that democracy and Islam cannot coexist.
