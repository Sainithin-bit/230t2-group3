 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Chevron Corp. ( CVX.N ), the No. 2 U.S. oil company, posted better-than-expected quarterly earnings on Friday on higher margins for gasoline and other refined products. 

 Oil and gas prices have dipped from the record highs hit last year, but profits from refining and gasoline sales have picked up the slack at some so-called integrated oil companies that both produce and refine oil. Chevron's net income increased to $4.72 billion, or $2.18 a share, in the first quarter, from $4 billion, or $1.80 a share, a year earlier. The rise was due to a refinery sale that added $700 million to earnings. Excluding the sale of Chevron's stake in the Nerefco refinery in the Netherlands, Chevron's profit was $1.86 a share, well ahead of the average analyst forecast of $1.68 a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue fell about 12 percent to $48.23 billion from $54.62 billion last year. Chevron's results were in step with Exxon Mobil Corp.'s ( XOM.N ) better-than-expected profit announced on Thursday. But not all integrated oil companies were able to take advantage of the high refining margins -- earnings fell 17 percent at BP Plc ( BP.L ) and ConocoPhillips' ( COP.N ) profit only rose because of more than $500 million in one-time gains. This year has been the second most expensive year on record for gasoline prices, according to Trilby Lundberg of the Lundberg Survey, and the billions oil companies are collecting has sparked criticism by some in Washington. U.S. Senators Robert Casey and Jim Webb introduced a windfall profits tax bill on Thursday that would increase taxes on energy companies when oil is trading above $50 a barrel. Chevron is "doing a lot of things right," said Tom Mangan, senior vice president of James Investment Research, who helps manage about $2 billion, including about $18 million in Chevron shares. "I think that's a reflection of good management, which is not a temporary phenomenon," he said. DOWNSTREAM EARNINGS NEARLY TRIPLE Chevron said earnings from its refining, marketing and transportation businesses nearly tripled to $1.62 billion, including the $700 million gain, from $580 million last year. The San Ramon, California, company said it had higher margins for refined products worldwide. But the company missed out on around $150 million in additional profits due to a fire at its Richmond, Calif., refinery in the quarter. "The company's reliability has been poor," said Mark Gilman, an analyst at The Benchmark Co. who has a "sell" rating on Chevron. Gilman suggested that had Chevron's Richmond and El Segundo, Calif., refineries operated at a satisfactory rate, then the company's U.S. refining earnings could have been tripled. Profit from Chevron's oil and gas exploration segment fell 16 percent to $2.91 billion. Oil prices dropped sharply at the beginning of the quarter as geopolitical tensions seemed to ease. But renewed friction between the United States and Iran, as well as concerns about gasoline supplies, have pushed prices back up. Chevron' average U.S. sales price for oil and natural gas liquids was $50 a barrel, down about $4 from last year. Natural gas prices decreased about 14 percent to $6.40 per thousand cubic feet. Outside of the United States, the company's average price for oil and liquids fell $4 to $51 a barrel, and natural gas prices rose 2 percent to $3.85 per thousand cubic feet. The company said oil and gas production in the quarter was basically flat at about 2.64 million barrels of oil equivalent per day. Earnings at its chemicals unit dipped to $120 million from $153 million last year. Through Thursday, Chevron shares had risen 6.3 percent this year, narrowly outperforming the Chicago Board Options Exchange's oil index .OIX, which was up about 5.8 percent. Chevron shares fell 9 cents to $78.09 in New York Stock Exchange trading on Friday afternoon. They hit an all-time high of $78.93 earlier in the week.
