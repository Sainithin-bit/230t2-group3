 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. GT.N posted a quarterly net loss on Friday pressured by several one-time charges and announced plans to step up its cost-cutting, sending shares to their highest level in more than seven years. 

 Goodyear, the largest U.S. tire maker, said it made significant progress on a multiyear restructuring plan and would lengthen the plan by a year and increase its goals, targeting additional cuts through 2009. "We expect a positive reaction ... due primarily to an upward revision in management's long term cost reduction target," CRT Capital Group senior analyst Kirk Ludtke said in a note. Goodyear posted a net loss of $174 million, or 96 cents per share, in the first quarter, compared with net income of $74 million, or 37 cents per share a year earlier. Goodyear, which has listed its engineered products business as discontinued due to its planned sale announced in March, posted a loss of 61 cents per share from continuing operations in the quarter. It earned 11 cents from continuing operations when excluding several one-time items in the quarter, such as the effect of a United Steelworkers strike in North America the last three months of 2006. Sales from continuing operations rose 0.8 percent to $4.5 billion in the quarter from a year earlier. Revenue per tire rose 8 percent in the quarter as price increases and the sale of a higher percentage of more expensive tires offset a $120 million increase in raw materials costs. Goodyear said it restored production in North America faster than it had expected after the strike and a weaker demand for tires from automakers allowed it to sell more tires in the replacement market, where it makes higher margins. Goodyear cut its 2007 forecast for the impact of the steelworkers strike to $100 million to $120 million, from $200 million to $230 million. Akron, Ohio-based Goodyear added a fourth-year to its multiyear restructuring plan and increased the annualized cost savings target range to $1.8 billion to $2 billion, from the prior target of $1 billion plus per year. The new target includes the $300 million per year of savings Goodyear expects to achieve through a new contract with the steelworkers that allows it to close a Texas tire plant in 2008 and create a trust fund for union retiree health care. Goodyear wants to have about half of its total production capacity in low cost manufacturing within five years. Goodyear plans to increase its capacity for producing more expensive and higher-profit tires by 40 percent. It also plans to increase production capacity at existing plants in low-cost countries by one-third to support growth in emerging markets, it said. Goodyear shares were up $1.63, or 5 percent, at $34.13 Friday on the New York Stock Exchange, after touching an intraday high of $34.65, its highest level since November 1999. Through Thursday, the shares had risen about 55 percent in 2007, while the Dow Jones U.S. automobiles and parts index .DJUSAP had risen about 11.3 percent.
