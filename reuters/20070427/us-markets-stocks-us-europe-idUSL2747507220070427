 LONDON  (Reuters) - U.S. stock futures edged lower on Friday but would likely not stray far from the broader market's six-year highs after Microsoft Corp ( MSFT.O ) reported strong earnings after the bell on Thursday. 

 Shares in Microsoft, the world's largest software maker, jumped 3 percent after the closing bell on Thursday, after the company posted a 65-percent rise in quarterly profit, driven by the success of its new Windows Vista operating system. This should help support the technology sector as well as the broader market as trade gets underway, although investors will likely remain cautious ahead of data on first-quarter U.S. economic growth. U.S. stock futures showed modest declines by mid-morning in Europe, with June Dow Jones futures DJM7 down 0.2 percent, S&P futures SPM7 off 0.2 percent and Nasdaq 100 futures NDM7 off 0.2 percent. Wall Street shares have risen to their highest level in over six years this week as corporate profits have generally beaten expectations and soothed concern about the economic outlook. "You've had some okay results, I wouldn't be doing any cartwheels if I were them at the moment ... having said that of course, we're seeing the indices continuing to press higher," said Peter Dixon, a strategist at Commerzbank. "It seems to be the case that investors are looking at stocks and saying 'we don't have many alternatives anywhere else,' and therefore, stocks appear to be soaking up the liquidity that is out there," he said. This week has been one of the busiest of the U.S. earnings season, with roughly 60 percent of the S&P having reported quarterly results. The S&P 500 appears to be on course to rack up its fourth consecutive weekly gain, its best run since a five-week stretch of gains between October 1 and October 29 2006. The Dow Jones Industrial Average  .DJI  closed up 15.61 points, or 0.12 percent, at 13,105.50 points on Thursday, while the Standard & Poor's 500  .SPX  ended down 1.17 points, or 0.08 percent, at 1,494.25 and the Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  closed up 6.57 points, or 0.26 percent, at 2,554.46. On the menu for Friday are results from Chevron Corp. ( CVX.N ), the second-largest U.S. oil and gas producer, and Alltell Corp ( AT.N ), the leading U.S. rural wireless provider. The economic agenda includes a first read of first-quarter gross domestic product. Analysts expect growth to have cooled to a 1.8 percent pace in the first three months of this year, from 2.5 percent in the last quarter of 2006. "Q1 growth was probably well below trend, below 2 percent and it's fair to say if you get those kind of numbers, you're looking at an economy that is not going great guns at all," Dixon said. But in general, companies across a wide range of sectors have beaten expectations and reinforced investor confidence in the health of the U.S. economy, in spite of the ongoing deterioration in the housing market and sub-prime lending environment. Among companies reporting on Thursday, Ford Motor Corp ( F.N ) posted a first-quarter loss that was smaller than analysts expected, and its shares ended up 4.1 percent at $8.20 on the  NYSE. Shares in Chinese web search engine Baidu.com Inc. ( BIDU.O ) rose over 19 percent after Thursday's bell to $130 after the company posted better than expected results. Adding a negative note though was a drop in shares in SanDisk Corp. ( SNDK.O ) a maker of flash memory chips for cell phones and digital cameras, which fell over 6 percent to $42.35 after the company posted a quarterly loss, reversing a year-earlier profit.
