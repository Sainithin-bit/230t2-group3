 AMSTERDAM  (Reuters) - ABN AMRO AAH.AS lifted a contentious "standstill" condition attached to opening its books to a group of suitors led by Royal Bank of Scotland ( RBS.L ), the Dutch bank said on Friday. 

 The RBS-led group, which includes Spain's Santander ( SAN.MC ) and Belgian-Dutch bank Fortis FOR.BR, called on ABN to drop the clause, which would prevent them from making an unsolicited approach for ABN for 12 months. ABN had previously offered to give the banks access to its books if they agreed to the condition. "ABN AMRO remains committed to exploring the consortium's proposal in a constructive manner," the bank said in a statement, "ABN AMRO has therefore decided to remove the customary requirement for a stand-still provision and has offered the consortium access to due diligence material."
