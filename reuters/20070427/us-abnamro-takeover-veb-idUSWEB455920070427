 THE HAGUE  (Reuters) - The Dutch commercial court said it will hear a lawsuit on Saturday by Dutch shareholders group VEB to freeze the $21 billion sale of ABN AMRO's AAH.AS U.S. unit LaSalle to Bank of America ( BAC.N ). 

 Bank of America agreed to buy LaSalle from ABN this week, in a related deal to Barclays' 65 billion euros ($88.49 billion) offer to buy ABN. VEB Chairman Peter Paul de Vries filed the lawsuit late on Thursday, after ABN's shareholders meeting where stakeholders demanded that ABN scrap the LaSalle sale because it prevented other bidders for making an offer for all of ABN. A consortium of Royal Bank of Scotland ( RBS.L ), Spain's Santander ( SAN.MC ) and Belgian-Dutch group Fortis FOR.BR said on Friday they were ready to make an unsolicited offer for ABN AMRO, and had already indicated earlier in the week that they were willing to pay as much as 72 billion euros for all of ABN.
