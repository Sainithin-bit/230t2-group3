 SAN ANTONIO, Texas  (Reuters) - AT&T Inc. ( T.N ) chief Ed Whitacre said on Friday he will retire in June after building the largest U.S. telecommunications service provider through seven large acquisitions over the past decade. 

 Chief Operating Officer Randall Stephenson will succeed Whitacre as both chief executive officer and chairman. He takes the helm of AT&T as it branches into new areas, such as video, to fight back against cable companies and keep consumers loyal as they ditch home phones for cell phones. Texas-born Whitacre, 65, announced his retirement after 44 years at an annual shareholders meeting in San Antonio, finishing his career as the telecommunications industry's most well-known deal maker and longest-serving CEO. "There would never be an easy time for me to leave this job. This job has meant so much to me, but now is the right time to step aside," said Whitacre, adding that June 3, his retirement date, will mark his 44th anniversary at AT&T. He has been chairman and CEO since 1990, when the company was Southwestern Bell, then the smallest of the so-called "Baby Bells." From a college job at Southwestern Bell, Whitacre rose through the ranks, weathering the break up and eventually engineering the reassembly of much of "Ma Bell" -- the industry's nickname for the original AT&T that traces its roots back more than 125 years to the invention of the telephone. His biggest deal was when AT&T bought BellSouth Corp. for $86 billion last year. Some analysts said AT&T, under Stephenson's leadership, would likely be less acquisitive, mainly because it had grown so much already. "I'm not sure it would be a management strategy difference. Certainly, as you get bigger there are larger regulatory concerns that might limit acquisitions," said Stifel Nicolaus analyst Christopher King. Other analysts say it makes sense for AT&T to consider buying satellite providers or smaller rivals. GROOMED Stephenson, 47, is well-regarded in the financial community and had been widely expected to be promoted to CEO since Whitacre's contract had been due to expire in April 2008. Most expected no change in business strategy. "He has been groomed for this position. He has been filling a lot of the CEO duties for some time now and I think he's extremely capable. He's certainly one of the best managers in the industry," said John Hodulik, analyst at UBS. Hodulik said Stephenson has overseen many parts of AT&T's business, including international operations and led its charge into the corporate market. "I think Ed had an engineering background and Randall had more of a financial background. I think that's what's made them a good team," the analyst said. Stephenson began his career with Southwestern Bell in 1982 and has held leadership positions in finance. As Whitacre's right-hand man, he laid the groundwork for the mergers of SBC, AT&T Wireless, AT&T Corp. and BellSouth. Analysts said Stephenson's biggest challenge would be to fight off competition from cable companies, take full advantage of growth in Internet and wireless communications and to ensure previous mergers are carried out smoothly. Earlier this week, AT&T said its first-quarter profit doubled, helped by its acquisition of BellSouth, although analysts said revenue growth and wireless subscriber growth were below expectations. AT&T said Whitacre will be receiving a pension and deferred compensation worth around $158 million, which drew complaints from some shareholders, who put forth proposals at Friday's meeting to limit or review executive pay. They were voted down. "It's a lot of money, but look at what he's done. He has built a company that's on top of the world. He really did deserve it," said Dorothy Ann Effinger, a shareholder who attended the meeting. AT&T shares ended down 32 cents at $38.64, while rival telephone operator Verizon Communications ( VZ.N ) slipped 8 cents to $37.89, both on the New York Stock Exchange.
