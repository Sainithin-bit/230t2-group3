 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Dell Inc.'s DELL.O direct sales model that turned the company into one of the world's top computer makers is "not a religion," and it is exploring other ways to reach customers, CEO Michael Dell said. 

 In an April 25 memo to employees, Michael Dell outlined a strategy for reinvigorating the company he founded, after slowing growth over the past two years led it to repeatedly miss analysts' financial forecasts. Dell, 42, replaced Kevin Rollins as chief executive on January 31, and is also the company's chairman. "The direct model has been a revolution, but is not a religion," Dell said in the memo, obtained on Friday by Reuters. "We will continue to improve our business model, and go beyond it, to give our customers what they really need." Dell did not say whether the company, based in Round Rock, Texas, would begin selling computers through retail stores. But analysts have said it must consider a retail strategy to better compete with Hewlett-Packard Co. ( HPQ.N ), which last year overtook Dell to become the largest PC maker, thanks partly to sales in stores. Dell sells computers via telephone or its Web site. Until recently, the company said it would stick to the direct-sales model despite slowing sales. Since resuming the CEO role, Michael Dell has set out to reduce bureaucracy in the company, reducing his management team to 12 members from more than 20 under Rollins. Dell hired Ron Garriques from Motorola Inc. MOT.N to oversee a new global consumer unit and tapped former Solectron Corp. SLR.N CEO Michael Cannon to head a new global operations business. "We need to streamline our management structure to speed decisions and remove bureaucracy," Dell said in the memo. "We're making improvements in pricing, product development and fulfillment, and customer experience." Cannon's group is "working to take our supply chain and manufacturing to the next level of efficiency and quality," the memo said. Those efforts "won't be merely exercises in cost-cutting," Dell added. "We will reinvest those resources in the customer solutions that will build Dell for the future." Garriques' team is reevaluating how the company addresses consumers in large emerging markets such as Brazil, Russia, India and China, the memo said. "Ron and team are also tackling how Dell's consumer business should evolve in the long term in mature markets," the memo said. "Stay tuned for more here."
