 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - General Motors ( GM.N ) suspended development work at two U.S. plants after talks between the union and management on cost cutting ended, the Wall Street Journal reported on its Web site on Friday. 

 United Auto Workers leaders ended talks at facilities in Fairfax, Kansas and Lordstown, Ohio after disagreements with the company, the Journal reported, citing unnamed sources. The paper cited sources as saying GM told UAW that it was suspending work related to two new-vehicle programs. UAW and GM could not immediately be reached for comment.
