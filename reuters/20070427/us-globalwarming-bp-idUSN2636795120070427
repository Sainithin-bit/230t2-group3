 PALO ALTO, California  (Reuters) - BP Chief Executive John Browne on Thursday called for the formation of an international climate agency to tackle global warming. 

 Browne, in a speech at Stanford University in Silicon Valley south of San Francisco, said the climate agency should have the United States, European Union and China as lead players and should be independent of the United Nations. "A new entity without any history would be good," Browne said. Governments "must work together because this is a global issue, and the costs of meeting the challenge will be higher if we don't act together", Browne said. "Governments need to re-establish the sense of collective endeavor which secured peace and prosperity after the second world war." The climate agency would set goals for lowering emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases linked to global warming, issue emission permits in line with the goals, encourage clean low-carbon development in emerging markets and technology transfers, and monitor and verify the work. London-based BP in 1997 was the first of the top-tier of Western oil companies to accept that global warming was occurring and that the burning of fossil fuels was likely to be a main cause. Browne has repeatedly said he believes the cost of emitting carbon dioxide should be "internalized", an economic term that means the polluter should pay to emit carbon dioxide (CO2). Nonetheless, the third-biggest Western oil company opposed U.S. legislation in 2005 that included a provision for caps on CO2 emissions. Browne said this was because of other provisions in the legislation and that BP still supported mandatory limits. Capturing carbon dioxide from gas, oil or coal-fired power generation and storing it in geological structures is an important and vital step to lower emissions, Browne said in his speech. BP has proposed two carbon-storage projects, one in Peterhead in Scotland and one at BP's Carson City refinery in California. "These are major projects each costing more than $1.5 billion and need clarity on policy and taxation for a company to take the risk to demonstrate something new," he said. Browne, who studied business at Stanford, will step down as chief executive in July, to be replaced by Tony Hayward.
