 NASHVILLE, Tennessee  (Reuters) - Aluminum makers see an automotive business opportunity in the push to cut carbon emissions, an Alcoa executive said this week. 

 As U.S. automakers seek to make their vehicles lighter and more efficient, that opens the door for aluminum makers to add more of their metal to cars. "Lightweighting and (environmental) sustainability are firmly linked," said Misha Riveros-Jacobson, president of Alcoa Inc.'s ( AA.N ) auto and truck structures. "The only way to regulate carbon dioxide emissions in vehicles is to get better fuel economy," she said. "We feel this definitely provides new opportunities for lightweight materials and for aluminum to get in the game to get creative in innovating and designing for fuel-efficiency," Riveros-Jacobson told participants at the Aluminum Association's spring meeting. Last year, aluminum surpassed iron as second most-used material in a vehicle, behind steel. Over the last 30 years, aluminum increased its share of metal content in North American autos from 80 lbs (36 kg) in 1973 to 327 lbs (147 kg) last year. Riveros-Jacobson pointed to a recent study that projected light-vehicle weight will come down 2 percent from just above 4,100 lbs (1,845 kg) in 2005 to about 4,000 lbs (1,800 kg) in 2015. In the same period, she said the study, conducted by auto industry research firm Ducker Worldwide, estimated that 12 percent or 480 lbs (216 kg) of every average vehicle will go through a mix change in order to meet the stricter emissions standards. "What that means is that over the next eight to 10 years, about 480 lbs inside of every average vehicle will be up for grabs," she told conferees in Nashville. The near 500 lbs in question is currently composed of iron, mild steel, and other metals that will be in a race with aluminum, high-strength steel, magnesium, and plastics for a portion of the share. "We're going to see some very innovative and creative approaches in trying to capture that 480 lbs. That's huge. We did the math and that's 7,500 billion lbs, if you take just the vehicles built in North America," Riveros-Jacobson said. The aluminum industry's biggest opportunity, she said, will be in working with the automakers on both vehicle design and fabrication and assembly design. "You can do some creative things in terms of design for fabrication and assembly that allow you to reduce parts overall in your system," she said. Some judicious engineering and assembly design using aluminum can take 40 to 50 percent of the weight out of a traditionally designed mild steel part. She told Reuters on the sidelines that Alcoa's own research and development team works closely with automakers' design teams to devise ways to use aluminum to meet their needs while lowering the weight in the car. "If the aluminum industry continues to make progress in material technology, innovation and design for performance," the Alcoa president said, "some researchers estimate that it is technically possible for aluminum in automotive applications to be carbon-neutral by 2017." By 2010, when fuel-economy restrictions on vehicles take effect in many countries like China, Japan and India, weight reduction in those countries' autos will also be necessary. Europe has already implemented carbon emission targets but will continue to tighten those restrictions by 2010.
