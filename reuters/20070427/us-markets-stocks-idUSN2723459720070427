 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The Dow Jones industrial average rose on Friday, with robust earnings pushing the blue-chip index to its third straight record close even as data showed the U.S. economy grew in the first quarter at its slowest pace in four years. 

 The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  was up 15.44 points, or 0.12 percent, to end unofficially at a record 13,120.94. But the Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  was down just 0.18 of a point, or 0.01 percent, to finish unofficially at 1,494.07. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  was up 2.75 points, or 0.11 percent, to close unofficially at 2,557.21. For the week, the Dow rose 1.23 percent, the S&P 500 gained 0.66 percent and Nasdaq advanced 1.22 percent.
