 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Alltel Corp. ( AT.N ), the leading rural wireless service provider, on Friday reported stronger-than-expected customer growth in the first quarter, but its profit missed estimates due to higher costs. 

 Alltel said it added almost 237,000 subscribers in the quarter, above the average expectation of 162,000 additions from seven analysts contacted by Reuters. "The operating metrics were very strong across the board. Particularly impressive was the acceleration of subscriber growth," said Roe Equity Research analyst Kevin Roe. On a net basis, first-quarter profit fell to $230 million, or 64 cents per share, from $297 million, or 77 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter, before the company spun off its traditional wireline phone business. Alltel's profit from current business, excluding discontinued businesses and expenses related to amortization and other items, rose to $225.4 million, or 63 cents a share, from $168.57 million, or 43 cents a share. On that basis, analysts, on average, expected earnings of 66 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue rose 13 percent to $2.08 billion, compared to the average analyst forecast of $2.107 billion. Alltel said year-ago revenues were adjusted to exclude the wireline business. Stanford Group analyst Michael Nelson said its missing the earnings target was likely a result of higher customer acquisition expenses to fuel the strong customer growth in the quarter. "I think that's a worthwhile trade-off, balancing growth with profitability," Nelson said. It said average monthly revenue per user, a key metric in wireless, increased 2 percent from a year ago to $52.49, including $4.70 for data services such as text messaging. The customer cancellation rate, also known as churn, was 1.77 percent, which Alltel said was a record low. Alltel said total costs and expenses for the quarter rose to $1.72 billion from $1.55 billion. Alltel spun off its traditional phone business in July of last year to form Windstream Corp. WIN.N Shares closed at $62.88 on Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange, near its 52-week high of $66.45. The company's shares have risen about 7 percent since the end of December on speculation it would be the latest U.S. phone company to be bought.
