 MOSCOW  (Reuters) - Russian flagship airline Aeroflot ( AFLT.MM ) expects to acquire 22 Boeing ( BA.N ) Dreamliners and 22 Airbus A350s by 2016 as it expands its fleet, CEO Vitaly Savelyev told Prime Minister Vladimir Putin. 

 "We expect to receive 22 Dreamliners, that is the Boeing-787s, by 2016, and we also expect 22 aircraft of the Airbus-350 model, which is currently being developed, to enter into service," Savelyev said according to RIA news agency. However, Putin urged the executive to purchase more locally-made planes. "We are already purchasing them," Savelyev said in a portion of the interview broadcast on Russia-24 television. "Not enough," the prime minister replied. Boeing last month also inked a deal worth up to $4 billion to supply 50 737 commercial jetliners to state-owned Russian Technologies. The state company is buying the planes on behalf of Aeroflot, which will lease them. Boeing is carrying out tests of the 787 Dreamliner, which achieves greater fuel-efficiency via a carbon-composite body design. Initial delivers to customers are scheduled for the fourth quarter. The initial test flight of the Airbus A350 is scheduled for the end of 2012, with deliveries to clients slated for the following year. Aeroflot has also ordered 30 Superjet-100 planes, Russia's first new aircraft design since the collapse of the Soviet Union. (Reporting by Alfred Kueppers; Editing by Ruth Pitchford)
