 (Reuters) - Japanese investigators have found problems in equipment that controls a fuel-tank valve on a Boeing Co ( BA.N ) 787 Dreamliner jet that was being probed for fuel leaks, the Nikkei newspaper reported on Thursday. 
 The fuel leak, found in a Japan Airlines Co ( 9201.T ) jet as it taxied to a Boston runway on January 9, came amid battery problems that have since grounded the Boeing 787 Dreamliner fleet globally. There were deficiencies in the way electrical-insulating paint was applied to a mechanism that opened and closed the fuel-tank valve, the Nikkei said, citing people familiar with the matter. Transport ministry investigators also found foreign matter on a switch that operated the same mechanism. The investigators believe that this caused the switch to send a signal that the valve was closed when it was still half open -- causing the leak, the Japanese daily said.

The same 787 involved in the January 9 fuel leak in Boston leaked fuel from its left wing nozzle at Tokyo's Narita International Airport on January 13.
