 LONDON  (Reuters) - Richard Branson, the biggest shareholder of UK cable operator NTL Inc. NTLI.O, has thrown his support behind a merger with broadcaster ITV ( ITV.L ), a person familiar with the situation told Reuters on Friday. 

 In the increasingly cutthroat market for TV and Internet customers, Branson believes a deal would create a stronger rival to satellite operator BSkyB ( BSY.L ), added the source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "He's quite excited about it," the source said. Branson became NTL's largest shareholder with about a 12 percent stake and a seat on the board after he sold Virgin Mobile to the cable operator earlier this year. A spokesman for the billionaire enterpreneur's Virgin Group could not immediately be reached. W.R. Huff Asset Management Co., another major NTL shareholder, also was briefed on the approach to ITV ahead of time and endorsed it, another source familiar with the situation said. A call to Huff's offices in Morristown, New Jersey, was not returned. A combination of the two companies would give NTL access to ITV's library of programs to distribute over its TV, Internet and mobile phone services. INITIAL MEETING NTL said on Thursday that it had approached ITV and scheduled an initial meeting to talk about merging the companies. ITV confirmed receipt of a "highly tentative expression of interest" from NTL, and said it was willing to listen. ITV's shares were down 1.3 percent at 110 1/2 pence at 1210 GMT. They had risen as much as 8 percent on Thursday before closing with a 6.2 percent gain, at 112 pence. NTL shares dropped 2.5 percent to $26.59 on the Nasdaq on Thursday. NTL's approach surprised many in the industry, with analysts struggling to see the rationale for such a deal. ITV has been struggling with a dismal advertising market and losing viewers to the growing number of digital channels offered in Britain. It is also without a CEO after Charles Allen stepped down earlier this year. NTL has also been tackling the integration of both fellow cable operator Telewest and Virgin Mobile. It will rebrand itself Virgin Media in early 2007. The New York-listed cable TV, Internet and telephone service provider said it had recorded a net loss of 37,300 customers in the third quarter. The company has 3.3 million customers using its pay-TV service, 4.2 million taking the telephone service and 3 million taking broadband. BSkyB said last week it had 8.2 million subscribers to its pay-TV service, following a net increase of 82,000 in the first quarter, which was its highest first-quarter net subscriber growth since 2003. It has signed up 74,000 customers to its new broadband service which was launched in July and has around 1 million registrations of interest.
