 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Shire ( SHP.L ) said on Friday that its Shire Laboratories Inc. subsidiary was suing Andrx Pharmaceuticals for patent infringement. 

 Watson Pharmaceuticals Inc. WPI.N, which recently acquired Andrx, is also named in the suits, which Shire said result from an Abbreviated New Drug Application filed by Andrx for generic versions of Adderall, an attention deficit hyperactivity disorder medicine.
