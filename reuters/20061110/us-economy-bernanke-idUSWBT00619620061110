 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve continues to monitor money supply gauges for clues on the economy even though the measures are no longer reliable as forecasting tools for economic growth or inflation, Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke said on Friday. 

 "Forecast errors for money growth are often significant, and the empirical relationship between money growth and variables such as inflation and nominal output growth has continued to be unstable at times," Bernanke said in prepared remarks to a European Central Bank conference in Frankfurt. Bernanke did not comment on the outlook for interest rates, inflation or economic growth in his prepared comments, which were made available in Washington. Despite concerns, money growth may still contain important information about future economic developments, Bernanke said. "Attention to money growth is thus sensible as part of the eclectic modeling and forecasting network used by the U.S. central bank," he said. The money supply measures the liquidity of different types of money, including currency, bank deposits and money market mutual funds. The Fed publishes data on money supply and has in the past set targets for money supply growth. But it abandoned that practice when a statutory reporting requirement lapsed in 2000 because the relationship between money supply growth and the performance of the U.S. economy had become unreliable. The rapid pace of financial innovation in the United States is one reason for the instability of the links between measurements of money supply and aspects of the economy, Bernanke said. Overseas holdings of a substantial portion of the U.S. currency has also contributed to this instability, he said. Bernanke's comments come on the heels of a warning by ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet against completely rejecting the use of monetary aggregates by central banks as a tool in setting policy. "A model of monetary policy that includes no role for money is incomplete in some important respects," Trichet wrote in the Financial Times on Thursday.
