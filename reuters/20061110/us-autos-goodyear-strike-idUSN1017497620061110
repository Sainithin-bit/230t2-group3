 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Negotiators for the United Steelworkers and Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. are set to meet next week for the first time since union members went on strike in North America five weeks ago, the union and company said on Friday. 

 The full negotiating teams from the union and the company are scheduled to meet Tuesday morning at a neutral site in Cincinnati, the union and Goodyear said separately. Goodyear said in a statement it would be the first formal negotiations since the strike began. Union spokesman Wayne Ranick stopped short of calling it a resumption of talks. Shares of Goodyear have jumped 18.8 percent since Thursday morning, when it released better-than-expected quarterly earnings, and said it was willing to resume talks. About 15,000 United Steelworkers members went on strike October 5 at 12 Goodyear facilities in the U.S. and four in Canada after the union rejected Goodyear's latest contract offer, citing concerns about plant closings and other issues. Goodyear, the largest U.S. tire maker, on Thursday said it remained committed to reducing high-cost production in North America under a restructuring plan that includes cost cuts and a focus on more profitable Goodyear brand tires. In late October, Goodyear said it would close a Tyler, Texas, plant covered by the union contract where 1,100 workers produce mainly private label tires. Its most recent proposal would protect all contract plants except Tyler. Ranick said the union remains open to discussions, but opposes the closing of plants covered by the contract. Goodyear reported losing $30 million to $35 million a week in operating income early in the strike and said North American production has been less than 50 percent of pre-strike levels. The company's contingency plan has included increasing imports from its overseas operations, running nonunion plants in North America at full capacity and using salaried and temporary workers at its struck plants. Shares of Goodyear rose 48 cents, or 2.74 percent, to $18.02 on Friday on the New York Stock Exchange.
