 (Reuters) - Monsanto ( MON.N ) reiterated its earnings forecast for fiscal 2007, projecting 15 to 20 percent growth in ongoing earnings per share, the agricultural products company said on Friday. 

 Monsanto sees reported and ongoing earnings per share between $1.50 and $1.57 for fiscal 2007, which is below analysts' average estimate of $1.59 before exceptional items, according to Reuters Estimates. Monsanto's reiteration came at an investor meeting in London, where its management also identified six areas that will contribute to the growth of the company's seeds and biotechnology traits business between now and 2010. Monsanto's U.S. and ex-U.S. corn seeds and traits, international traits, cotton, Seminis fruit and vegetable seeds, and its research and development pipeline are seen as its growth drivers, the company said in news release.
