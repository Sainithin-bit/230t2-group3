 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - China will diversify its $1 trillion foreign exchange reserves, the largest in the world, across different currencies and investment instruments, including in emerging markets, Chinese central bank governor Zhou Xiaochuan said on Friday. 

 His remarks sent the dollar tumbling for a second day and fueled a growing debate about how China should best use its fast-growing reserves, which are about 70 percent in U.S. debt securities, bankers estimate. "(Diversification) includes currencies, investment instruments, including emerging markets," Zhou told Reuters on Friday on the sidelines of a monetary conference here. Asked about selling U.S. dollars, he said: "We do not have any new preparations for selling any currencies." He said gold sales were not under consideration. Changes in China's massive stockpile of money are being closely watched because it could ripple through financial markets worldwide, risking a steep dollar fall if U.S. debt floods onto the market, which could push up U.S. interest rates and slow global growth. These fears caused the U.S. dollar to hit a 2-1/2 month low against the euro <FRX/>, while gold prices rose to fresh two-month highs but emerging market debt was largely unaffected. In comments published on Friday, Chinese researchers said the country's huge pile of reserves was a double-edged sword. On the one hand it increased foreign confidence in China's economic stability and laid the foundation for China to make the yuan  CNY=CFXS  fully convertible in future. On the other hand the reserves symbolized China's growing economic imbalances, including a record trade surplus, and so helped spark friction with its main trading partners. It also exposed China to more market risks, generated upward pressure on the yuan, raised the risk of inflation and made it harder for the central bank to conduct monetary policy, they said. "China now faces a dilemma. It either keeps the exchange rate stable or sacrifices sound economic growth," Dou Erxiang, a researcher at Peking University, told the official newspaper Financial News. GROWTH SLOWDOWN Speaking on a panel with the world's leading central bankers in Frankfurt, Zhou said that a mushrooming trade surplus meant China needed stronger policy adjustment both on the yuan and through boosting internal demand. But he said any changes to the yuan would be gradual to avoid unbalancing the domestic economy. He also said the Chinese economy was showing signs of slowing and declined to talk of further interest rate rises at this stage. China depegged the yuan from the dollar in July last year, allowing for a 2.1 percent revaluation. It has since appreciated more but many analysts say it is still greatly undervalued, given China's trade surpluses and foreign capital inflows. "The reason why we adopt a gradual approach for exchange rate reform is because China has a very large amount of labor working in the trade-related sector," Zhou said. "So we have to consider this. We should avoid too much or too sudden closing-down or bankruptcies of enterprises and laying-off of workers. "We are trying to manage to adjust the balance of payments and meanwhile to keep domestic economy in the good (state)." China is growing at its fastest pace since 1995, driven by a boom in exports and investment that is feeding on cheap money, but Zhou expressed satisfaction that the pace of growth was easing from the first quarter's 11.3 percent. "It has already slowed down to some extent so we have reached the expected result of macro-economic adjustment," he said. In August China raised interest rates for the second time in four months to help tame a boom in credit and investment than some fear could end in a hard landing for the economy. Asked whether or not rates will rise further, Zhou said: "It is not convenient to say right now." The central bank was also waiting to see the impact of the increase in bank reserve requirements, tightened by half a percentage point last week for the third time in five months. Zhou brushed off a jump in China's trade surplus to $23.83 billion in October, a third more than economists had forecast. "Recent trade surpluses to some extent are related to season because now it's close to Christmas... We should observe average monthly trade surplus," Zhou said.
