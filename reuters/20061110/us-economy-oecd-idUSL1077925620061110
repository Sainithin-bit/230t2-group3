 PARIS  (Reuters) - The economic outlook for the Group of Seven industrial nations has improved, an OECD report released on Friday showed, but it also pointed to slowing growth in the euro area. 

 The Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said its composite leading indicator for the G7 area rose to 105.6 in September from a revised 105.2 in August. Italy was the only one of the seven countries to post a decline. The figure for the 30-nation OECD area also improved, to 109.6 in September from a revised 109.1 the previous month. A less volatile measure, the six-month rate of change, rose by 2.5 percent in September for the OECD area compared with 2.1 percent in August. But that same indicator for the euro zone countries rose 2.7 percent, slower than the 3.1 percent rise in the previous month. "The latest composite leading indicators suggest that slow economic expansion lies ahead in the OECD area," the OECD said. "September 2006 data show improved performance in the CLI's (composite leading indicator) six-month rate of change in the United States and Japan, but weakening performance in the Euro area." The 6-month indicator for the United States climbed 2.6 percent after rising 1.4 percent in August and for Japan, the fall was less steep in September -- a drop of 2.0 percent compared with a 2.4 percent fall the previous month. The OECD also said the data for non-member economies pointed to a weakening outlook for Russia and India, moderating growth in China and steady expansion in Brazil.
