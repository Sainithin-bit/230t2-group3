 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The United States and Russia have reached an agreement in principle on bilateral terms for Moscow's entry into the World Trade Organization and hope to sign the pact next week in Hanoi, the U.S. Trade Representative's office said on Friday. 

 "We have an agreement in principle and are finalizing the details. We are also holding consultations with the Congress and our cleared advisers. This agreement will mark an important step in Russia attaining membership in the WTO," U.S. Trade Representative Susan Schwab said in a statement. The agreement removes one of the last obstacles in Moscow's 13-year-old bid to join the WTO. However, it still must reach a multilateral deal with all WTO members to bring its domestic laws and regulations into line with international norms. Schwab said she and Russian Trade Minister German hoped to sign the pact next week when both are in Hanoi for an annual APEC (Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation) meeting. The deal "is a clear indication of Russia's efforts to participate fully in and benefit from the rules-based global trading system," Schwab said. It also would remove an irritant in the U.S.-Russia relationship. Moscow has accused Washington of dragging out negotiations on Russia's entry into the WTO and was disappointed when a deal wasn't reached in July at the Group of Eight summit meeting in St. Petersburg. Bush will meet with Putin next week in Moscow on his way to the APEC meeting.
