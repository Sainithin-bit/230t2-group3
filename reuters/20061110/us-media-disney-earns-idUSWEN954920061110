 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co. ( DIS.N ) said on Thursday its profit doubled, thanks to growth from its theme parks and movies and TV shows such as "Pirates of the Caribbean" and "High School Musical", but its shares fell 2 percent after touching a five-year high. 

 Disney said U.S. hotel bookings were flat in the current quarter, and some analysts said investors were concerned the company would not be able to maintain its growth spurt. "They had an absolutely outstanding year and it's just going to be hard to beat that," David Miller of Sanders Morris Harris said. "When you're this large, it's hard to grow fast." The shares on Thursday had hit their highest level since mid-2001, and were trading at a small premium to Disney peers. Expectations for Disney have risen since Chief Executive Robert Iger took over last year and began an aggressive series of moves such as buying Pixar Animation Studios, making cuts at the film unit, and offering content for sale on the Internet. Disney reported a fourth-quarter net profit of $782 million, or 36 cents per share, compared with $379 million, or 19 cents per share, a year before. Revenue rose 14 percent to $8.8 billion. Analysts, on average, expected earnings of 33 cents per share and revenue of $8.7 billion for the quarter, according to Reuters Estimates. Disney does not give quarterly forecasts, but this year it projected double-digit earnings per share growth through 2008. Chief Financial Officer Tom Staggs said hotel bookings at domestic parks for the quarter to December were in line with a year ago, when Disney had record holiday attendance. "I think that (they) over-delivered on fiscal 2006 and people are thinking, 'How do we get to that double-digit growth for fiscal 2007?'" BMO Capital Markets analyst Jeff Logsdon said. In the fiscal fourth quarter, studio entertainment posted the biggest rise in revenue of all Disney units, growing 33 percent to $2.0 billion, and turned an operating profit of $214 million, compared with a $313 million loss a year earlier. Media networks revenue, boosted by higher advertising rates at sports network ESPN and for ABC primetime hits such as "Desperate Housewives" and "Lost," were up 10 percent and operating profit rose by 18 percent to $883 million. Iger told analysts on a conference call that Disney was close to signing a long-term programming deal with Compacts Corp. ( CMCSA.O ) in the next week, in which Disney would provide access to its main products like ESPN and the Disney Channel. Iger said Disney may also create unique material for Compacts. Another pending deal, the sale of ABC radio assets to Citadel Broadcasting Corp. CDL.N, was expected to close in the first half of calendar 2007, Staggs said, adding that Disney discussed possible modifications to the deal to facilitate Citadel's post-closing financing. Spot TV ad sales were "solid" in the current quarter, with primetime ad rates pacing ahead of 2006 advance ad rates by low single digits, Staggs said. Ad sales at Disney owned-and-operated TV stations were up by double-digit percentages this quarter due to political advertising. Attendance rose at parks and resorts in the fourth quarter, along with per capita spending and hotel occupancy, driving up division revenue by 8 percent and operating income by 28 percent to $396 million. Consumer products revenue rose 9 percent, while operating profit rose 1 percent over a year ago to $139 million. Fiscal 2007 earnings drivers include a third installment of "Pirates of the Caribbean" and the Disney-Pixar animated film "Ratatouille." Disney plans to lift capital expenditure by $400 million to $500 million in 2007, with about half for park improvements and much of the remainder on new media initiatives at ESPN, Staggs said. Spending on video game development would rise 30 percent in fiscal 2007, he said. Disney was looking for Internet and download revenues of about $700 million in fiscal 2007. The stock rose 28 percent in fiscal 2006 and 8 percent last quarter and traded on Thursday at 19.6 times estimated fiscal 2007 profit, while Time Warner Inc. ( TWX.N ) trades at 19.4 times forward earnings and Viacom Inc. VIA.N at 17.5. Disney shares fell to $32.89 in after-hours trading from a close of $33.58.
