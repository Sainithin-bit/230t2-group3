 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Bank of America Corp. ( BAC.N ), the No. 2 U.S. bank, may yet consider making an acquisition in the Midwest, with Cleveland-based KeyCorp ( KEY.N ) a possible target, according to Punk, Ziegel & Co. analyst Richard Bove. 

 In a note, Bove wrote Bank of America has about 9.2 percent of U.S. bank deposits, well below the 10 percent ceiling that could prevent it from making a domestic acquisition. This means Bank of America could acquire another $54 billion in deposits. Bove wrote that Bank of America would be precluded from buying the 11 top depositories in the United States but it could buy any of the 9,000 other banks in the country. "If one assumes that the government might let Bank of America sell off enough deposits after a merger to get under the 10 percent deposit ceiling required by law, then there are really only 9 banks it could not acquire in a realistic sense," Bove wrote. Bank of America spokesman Terry Francisco said the company did not comment on speculation, but pointed out that chief executive Kenneth Lewis has said the company sees no strategic imperative to make an acquisition. KeyCorp spokesman Bill Murschel said the company does not comment on analyst speculation. As to where Bank of America is likely to acquire, Bove wrote that the U.S. Midwest would seem likely as it is the only region of the country the bank does not blanket with branches. "Who might the bank buy? Not U.S. Bancorp ( USB.N ), it is too big," Bove wrote. "Everyone else in the market is possible and KeyCorp might even be probable." KeyCorp has a market value of about $14.75 billion. KeyCorp was not immediately available for comment. Bank of America shares were down 9 cents at $54.42 and KeyCorp stock was up 28 cents at $36.99 on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday afternoon.
