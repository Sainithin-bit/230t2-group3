 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Shares of New York Stock Exchange owner NYSE Group Inc. NYX.N shot to a new high on Friday, given a boost by various factors such as speculation it could remove trading fee caps, according to one analyst. 

 Shares of the company, which became publicly traded in March through its acquisition of electronic rival Archipelago Holdings Inc., ended up 7.9 percent at a closing high of $94.48 on the NYSE, after reaching an intra-day high of $96.75. The shares started trading in March at around $64. Other exchanges also got a lift, such as Nasdaq Stock Market Inc. ( NDAQ.O ), up 4.9 percent at $37.79, and International Securities Exchange Inc. ISE.N, the largest U.S. equity options market, up 4.8 percent to $49.31. Richard Herr, analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, cited speculation that the NYSE was considering removing trading fee caps. Dealers trade for free after reaching a certain threshold in trading volume, said Herr, and removing the cap would open up opportunities for the NYSE to get paid on all the volume. An NYSE spokesman declined to comment. Herr also cited developments in NYSE's bid to buy Paris-based exchange Euronext ENXT.PA. Euronext management in June accepted a takeover proposal by NYSE and rejected a rival offer by Frankfurt-based Deutsche Boerse ( DB1Gn.DE ). The NYSE bid will soon be put to vote by Euronext shareholders. The Wall Street Journal said on Friday that Deutsche Boerse faces a potential new hurdle in its campaign to buy Euronext, with two European Union officials saying antitrust regulators doubted whether they should review Deutsche Boerse's preliminary offer. That could help the NYSE's offer, Herr said. In addition, the WSJ reported that business had won the battle to ease one of the most controversial requirements mandated by the Sarbanes-Oxley corporate-reform law -- which the paper said could be good news for U.S. stock exchanges. Separately, analysts and dealers said NYSE shares got a boost after Wall Street pundit Jim Cramer told CNBC that the stock could rise. Herr said the exchange sector as a whole was being boosted by the NYSE's rise. "If the NYSE is moving up, to some extent you can make the case that the space is being revalued today and valuations are moving higher." Meanwhile, shares of the London Stock Exchange ( LSE.L ) have been actively traded in the past few sessions as investors position themselves for a possible fresh bid for the exchange, possibly coming on Monday, analysts and dealers told Reuters in London. Nasdaq had its offer for the LSE rebuffed earlier this year. It has since built up a stake of about 25 percent in the LSE. LaBranche & Co. Inc. LAB.N, the NYSE's largest market maker, rose 10.6 percent to $9.67. Analyst Richard Repetto at Sandler O'Neill said its shares were up because it has a large shareholding in the NYSE. LaBranche owns about 3 million shares of NYSE, according to Reuters data.
