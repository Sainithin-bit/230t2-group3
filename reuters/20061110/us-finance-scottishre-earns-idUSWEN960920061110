 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Reinsurer Scottish Re Group Ltd SCT.N posted a quarterly loss and said it still planned to agree a sale of all or part of the company through a deal that could be struck within weeks. 

 It posted a net loss of $30.5 million, or 54 cents a share compared with net income of $31.9 million, or 66 cents a share in the year-ago quarter. The company cited one-off expenses and an "unusually high tax expense for the quarter" for the latest quarter. Revenue rose 8 percent to $611.3 million from $563.7 million in the prior year. The company said it was still pursuing alternatives but warned that it could not give a guarantee that a deal would be reached, or for the price of a transaction, which "may be below the share price as of market close November 9, 2006." It said it expected the process to conclude within the next several weeks.
