 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The American Heart Association on Friday said it would not allow Pfizer Inc. ( PFE.N ) to present a study on its closely watched drug torcetrapib at the organization's scientific meeting next week after the drugmaker broke an AHA embargo. 

 The heart association had pulled an abstract with data from the study of the cholesterol drug from its meeting planning Web site in response to Pfizer issuing some of the data in an October 31 news release. But on Thursday had said the official presentation would go ahead as planned at next week's meeting in Chicago. The association reversed that decision on Friday, issuing a statement saying that it has decided to pull the torcetrapib presentation from its scientific session. "Prior to this decision the meeting planners had removed the abstract from the on-line meeting planner while internal discussions were underway," the AHA statement said. "Today after discussions among AHA staff and leadership the AHA has decided to pull (Pfizer's) presentation in accordance with AHA embargo policy." Pfizer did not immediately return calls seeking comment. Torcetrapib, a drug designed to raise levels of HDL, or "good" cholesterol, is by far the most important experimental medicine in Pfizer's developmental pipeline. The world's No. 1 drugmaker is looking to torcetrapib to counter revenue declines when Lipitor loses patent protection in 2011. Lipitor, which lowers levels of LDL, or "bad" cholesterol, is the world's top-selling prescription medicine with annual sales of about $13 billion. The late-stage study that was to be presented compared torcetrapib plus Lipitor against Lipitor alone in patients with high cholesterol. In its October 31 news release, Pfizer said the combination raised HDL levels and lowered LDL levels significantly more than Lipitor alone. But existing concerns about torcetrapib were heightened by another signal that the drug also raised blood pressure, a risk factor for heart attack.
