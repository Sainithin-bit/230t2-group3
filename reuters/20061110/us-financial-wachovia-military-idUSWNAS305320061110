 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Wachovia Corp. WB.N, the No. 4 U.S. bank, on Friday expanded its pay policy for employees on military leave, saying it will provide full pay to employees throughout their active service, beginning January 1, 2007. 

 Previously, Wachovia had guaranteed full pay for up to one year of service. Under an exception granted in 2003, the bank had been extending full pay beyond one year for longer leaves. Wachovia, which is based in Charlotte, North Carolina, said it has 63 employees in active service who are taking advantage of its military leave policy.
