 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - NYSE Euronext NYX.N, which runs the New York Stock Exchange, said on Thursday it had resolved stock quote delays that affected the NYSE and the NYSE Amex cash markets earlier in the session. 

 "That issue has been resolved. The initial problem was sending out quotes that were stale," said Ray Pellecchia, NYSE Euronext spokesman. He added that trading had been unaffected and the cause of delays were under investigation. The delays had affected quotes in the range A through HZZ, according to a brief status alert issued by the NYSE earlier on Thursday. (Reporting by  Ellis Mnyandu , Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)
