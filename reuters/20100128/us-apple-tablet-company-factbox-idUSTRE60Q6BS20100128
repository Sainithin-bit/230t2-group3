 (Reuters) - Apple Inc on Wednesday took the wraps off its highly anticipated tablet computer, as the company looks to define the nascent tablet computer market. 

 Apple's iPod has already succeeded in changing the face of the music industry, and the iPhone has become the standard by which other smartphones are measured. A look at Apple's products and finances: * From fiscal 2004 through 2009, annual revenue grew to $42.9 billion from $8.3 billion, while earnings rose to $8.2 billion from $276 million. * Apple's market capitalization of nearly $185 billion is second only to Microsoft Corp's among U.S. technology companies. * Mac sales made up 37 percent of Apple's revenue in fiscal 2009, with iPods at 22 percent and iPhones at 18 percent. * Apple has sold more than 250 million iPods since their launch in 2001. * Apple holds roughly $40 billion in cash and securities. * It operates a total of 283 retail stores in 10 countries.
