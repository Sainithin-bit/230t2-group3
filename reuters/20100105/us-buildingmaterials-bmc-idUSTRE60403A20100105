 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Building Materials Holding Corp BLGM.PK said on Monday that it has exited U.S. bankruptcy protection as secured lenders have converted their debt into equity ownership of the company. 

 The company said it is emerging from bankruptcy protection as a private company and rebranding itself "BMC Select." The company, which is moving its corporate headquarters to Boise, Idaho from San Francisco, provides building materials to home builders and contractors. It filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in June with an agreement from a secured lender group to restructure its balance sheet. The case is: Building Materials Corp, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, District of Delaware, No. 09-12074. (Reporting by  Emily Chasan , editing by Leslie Gevirtz)
