 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Swiss food giant Nestle will vault to the top spot in U.S. frozen pizza with a $3.7 billion deal to buy Kraft Foods' brands like DiGiorno and benefit from a bigger presence in the supermarket freezer aisle. 

 Nestle ( NESN.VX ) and Kraft KFT.N said on Tuesday that the deal was due to close this year. Kraft will use proceeds of the deal to fund a higher cash portion in its Cadbury Plc CBRY.L offer, while Nestle ruled out bidding for the UK chocolatier. Rather than bulk up on sweets, Nestle will be home to a pizza business with total sales of about $2.9 billion and a market-leading share in the United States, the largest consumer of frozen pizzas. The company's existing frozen pizza operations are smaller and mostly sold in Europe. In doing so, it will benefit from savings as it joins pizza distribution with its ice cream brands. Down the road, Nestle could find new ways to market its pizzas with its Hot Pockets, Stouffer's and Lean Cuisine brands. "This frozen pizza business greatly enhances Nestle's frozen food activities in North America," Nestle CEO Paul Bulcke said in a statement. He cited strong North American brands -- which include Tombstone and California Pizza Kitchen CPKI.O -- research and development and distribution that will complement Nestle's ice cream delivery operations. Nestle thinks it can boost the Kraft unit's operating margins to 20 percent from 13.3 percent last year, said Kepler Capital Markets analyst Jon Cox. "This obviously helps them with regards to the other frozen businesses," he said. Cox said Nestle could leverage its new heft to introduce Buitoni frozen pizzas in the U.S. market, while offering U.S. brands in Europe. Immediate savings will come from common purchasing and more efficient use of plant capacity and distribution channels. Nestle, which also makes Haagen-Dazs ice cream, Nescafe coffee and Kit Kat chocolate bars, estimated synergies from the deal at 7 percent of sales and said those would be fully realized within five years. "The target is clearly to generate synergies with frozen businesses they already own," Bank Sarasin analyst Patrick Hasenbohler said. "You can distribute ice cream with pizza even if it has no synergies from a product side." CADBURY BIDDING A CATALYST? With estimated 2009 sales of $2.1 billion, Kraft's frozen pizza business saw double-digit growth in the last four years, and benefited more recently as consumers prepare more of their meals to save money in a weak economy. Kraft held 15.1 percent of the frozen pizza market in 2008, making it the largest player as ranked by retail sales, while Nestle was No. 5, according to Euromonitor International. The global frozen pizza industry grew at a compound average growth rate of 22.5 percent from 2004 to 2009, although that growth is expected to slow to 12.8 percent through 2014, Euromonitor said. However, projected growth in the United States will be a more healthy 17 percent. The U.S. pizza market totals about $37 billion, including $4.5 billion in the frozen segment, according to Nestle. A company spokesman said Nestle has been working on the Kraft deal for about a year, although analysts said the Cadbury bidding war may have sped its conclusion. BMO Capital markets analyst Kenneth Zaslow said in a research note that Nestle could further benefit from the bidding for Cadbury as it could do more deals with Kraft, or any potential rivals looking to raise cash for their offers. Bulcke said in September that Nestle had no plans for big acquisitions in 2009 and 2010, but was always open to opportunities. The company has also said it was considering a greater focus on "well-being" as it seeks higher-margin businesses. "I don't think we should get too hung up on (the fact) that it's not in the health category," Cox said of the Kraft pizza business. "Nestle does ice cream and I don't think anybody would say ice cream is particularly healthy." Besides, Nestle could choose to offer low-sodium pizzas or ones enhanced with Omega-3 that would fit more broadly under the health, nutrition and wellness category, he said. The Kraft deal comes a day after Nestle agreed to sell its remaining 52-percent stake in eye care group Alcon Inc ACL.N to Swiss drugmaker Novartis AG ( NOVN.VX ) for $28.1 billion in cash. Nestle also said on Monday it was launching a new $9.64 billion, two-year share buyback program.
