 (Reuters) - Iceland's president said on Tuesday he would not sign into law a bill to repay more than $5 billion lost by savers in Britain and the Netherlands when the island's banks collapsed, meaning a referendum on the issue will be held. President Olafur Grimsson's rejection of the bill is seen putting aid from international lenders, as well as aspirations to join the European Union, in serious jeopardy. Financial aid is vital for Iceland in the wake of its economic meltdown. 

 Here is a timeline of events since Iceland's financial meltdown. October 6, 2008 - Threatened with national bankruptcy, Icelanders give the government sweeping powers, including wide-ranging authority over its banks. October 7 - The government dismisses the board of directors of Landsbanki, the island's second largest bank by value, and puts the bank in receivership. October 8 - The government takes control of Glitnir, the third-largest bank, buying a 75 percent stake for 600 million euros ($878 million). October 9 - The financial crisis deepens as Iceland also takes control of Kaupthing, its biggest bank. -- A diplomatic row breaks out between Iceland and Britain over how to deal with hundreds of millions of pounds of British deposits trapped in collapsed Icelandic banks. October 15 - Iceland shores up its ravaged economy by slashing borrowing costs; the central bank cuts its main interest rate to 12 percent from 15.5 percent. October 24 - Iceland asks the IMF for $2 billion in aid to help fix the economy and restart currency trading. October 25 - Protesters demand the resignation of conservative Prime Minister Haarde. October 28 - The government raises interest rates by a massive 6 percentage points to 18 percent, a surprise move that aims to please the IMF and restore trust in the shattered currency. November 19 - The IMF approves a $2.1 billion loan for Iceland. The deal is complemented by more than $3 billion in loans from Nordic countries, Russia and Poland and around $5 billion from Britain, the Netherlands and Germany, making the whole package worth about $10 billion. December 2 - The government announces debt relief and investment measures for its ailing business sector and says it will settle debts with foreign creditors by offering stakes in the new Icelandic banks. January 26, 2009 - Iceland's ruling coalition falls apart when Prime Minister Haarde says he is resigning. Two days later the Social Democrats are given a mandate to form a new government.

The Social Democrats, the junior partner in the previous government, forms the caretaker administration with the Left-Greens.

July 17 - Iceland applies to join the EU a day after parliament narrowly backed government plans to begin talks on joining. August 28 - Parliament approves "Icesave" bill, having added conditions such as linking payment to GDP development. The revisions will need the approval of the governments of Britain and the Netherlands. October 18 - Agrees to a new deal to repay Britain and the Netherlands, paving the way for new aid from international lenders.
