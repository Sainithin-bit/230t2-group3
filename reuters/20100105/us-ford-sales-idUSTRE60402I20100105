 SHANGHAI  (Reuters) - Ford Motor's China car venture sold 316,139 units in 2009, up 54.5 percent from a year earlier, its Chinese partner said on Tuesday. 

 In December alone, Changan Ford Mazda, a tie-up between Ford, Chongqing Changan Auto Co and Mazda Motor, sold 27,680 cars, up 61.4 percent from a year earlier, Changan Auto said in a statement. China, the world's largest auto market, is the major bright spot amid a global industry downturn thanks to Beijing's stimulus measures, which have effectively bolstered consumer confidence. Overall sales by Changan Auto, a subsidiary of China's third-largest state auto group, came to 1.37 million units in 2009, up 64.1 percent from 2008, the company said. SAIC Motor Corp, Changan Auto's domestic rival and China's biggest automaker, sold 2.72 million vehicles in 2009, up 57 percent from a year earlier. SAIC is a manufacturing partner of General Motors and Volkswagen AG. (Reporting by Fang Yan and  Jason Subler ; Editing by  Jonathan Hopfner )
