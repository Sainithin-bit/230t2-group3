 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - World stocks rose at a slower pace on Tuesday but investors remained upbeat about the global economic recovery despite weaker-than-expected U.S. housing data that saw the U.S. dollar lose ground against the yen. 

 A day after global equities touched 15-month highs on the first day of 2010, some investors eased up on buying riskier assets after a sharp drop in U.S. pending home sales data with the U.S. jobs report due on Friday. The MSCI's all-country world stock index .MIWD00000PUS rose 0.27 percent to a level not seen since October 2008. The MSCI emerging market index .MSCIEF rose 0.93 percent to the highest since August 2008, before the collapse of U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers triggered last year's financial crisis globally. "The underlying trend for the short-term is still up. Corporate confidence is very high and earnings are continuing to be revised up. The picture now is for a more solid type of recovery outlook," said Mike Lenhoff, strategist at Brewin Dolphin in London. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended down though after a report showed U.S. pending home sales in November dropped 16 percent after rising for nine straight months. The Nasdaq ended flat while the S&P 500 index was slightly higher, supported by a report showing factory orders in December rising to the highest level since April 2006. "The housing figure from the U.S. did put a bit of dampener on everything. If that housing market gives in the U.S. then it would be seriously bad news for the recovery," Lenhoff said. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  fell 0.11 percent, at 10,572.02, while the Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  inched up 0.01 percent, at 2,308.71 to hit its highest close in 16 months. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  rose 0.31 percent, at 1,136.52, a fresh 15-month closing high. The U.S. dollar fell as the housing data dampened expectations the U.S. Federal Reserve could raise interest rates sooner rather than later. The weaker housing data backed comments by Federal Reserve Governor Elizabeth Duke on Monday that there were still strong headwinds in the housing market and the Fed needs to keep interest rates "exceptionally low" for an "extended period." [ID:nN04212241] The U.S. dollar fell 0.96 percent to 91.66 yen, on track for its biggest one-day percentage loss in nearly a month. The euro was down 0.31 at $1.4367, having climbed to around $1.4483 earlier in the day to hit its strongest since December 17. U.S. Treasury debt prices rose as bargain hunting persisted in the wake of recent losses, with benchmark 10-year notes up 16/32 in price, yielding 3.76 percent, versus 3.82 percent at Monday's close. Last week, U.S. 10-year yields rose to 3.918 percent, their highest since early June, after surprisingly strong weekly jobless claims figures bolstered expectations among some that Friday's payrolls report will show employment growth. Any sign of jobs growth raises expectations the U.S. Federal Reserve will begin to plan interest rate hikes -- a move that would boost the value of dollar-based assets. The FTSEurofirst 300  .FTEU3  index of top European shares closed down 0.1 percent after the U.S. home sales data. Japan's Nikkei  .N225  inched up 0.3 percent to 10,681.83, its highest close since October 3 2008.
