 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Motorola Inc. MOT.N said on Wednesday it took $221 million in charges for job cuts in the first half of 2007, according to a regulatory filing. 

 Motorola said the severance costs came from cutting about 4,100 jobs. Job cuts will result in a net pre-tax charge of around $83 million in the third quarter, the company said in its filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
