 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. antitrust authorities dropped an administrative challenge to Western Refining Inc's ( WNR.N ) $1.13 billion purchase of rival Giant Industries Inc, the Federal Trade Commission said on Wednesday. 

 A federal appeals court ruled in June that the deal could go ahead despite a request by the FTC to halt it pending the result of the agency's internal administrative litigation. FTC commissioners voted 3-2 to dismiss the administrative case. Despite the vote, the commission indicated that it continued to believe that the merger posed antitrust concerns. "If the only consideration were whether we agree with the district court's decision and reasoning, we would remand," the majority wrote. "We do not agree with the district court's view of the facts of this case." But the commissioners went on to cite other evidence, which led to their decision to drop the case. One was that a pipeline from El Paso, Texas to Albuquerque, New Mexico, may expand more quickly than previously thought and would lead to more competition. Another was the drain on FTC resources. "Given the district court's finding that the commission failed to define a geographic market, and its negative assessment of our two experts' analyses, we believe that an administrative proceeding would require substantially more resources, which should instead be allocated to new competition matters, including in particular other gasoline matters," the majority wrote. The FTC's two dissenters, Commissioners Pamela Jones Harbour and J. Thomas Rosch, disagreed with the decision to drop the administrative case. "There is substantial evidence that the loss of Giant's incremental production would cost Albuquerque consumers millions of dollars annually," they wrote in their dissent. (Reporting by  Diane Bartz )
