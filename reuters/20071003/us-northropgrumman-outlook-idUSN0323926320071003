 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Northrop Grumman Corp ( NOC.N ), the No. 3 U.S. defense contractor, still expects 2007 earnings from continuing operations of $4.90 to $5.05 per share, its chief financial officer said on Wednesday. 

 Northrop Grumman, which established the earnings forecast in July after raising the bottom end of the range, expects revenue of $31.5 billion, CFO James Palmer said during a presentation at an investor conference organized by CIBC World Markets. Wall Street analysts had been expecting Northrop Grumman to post 2007 earnings of $5.05 per share on revenue of $31.63 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. Palmer also said profit margins should rise over the long term as its ships division recovers from hurricane damage at a shipyard. Separately, Northrop Grumman said it was one of five companies awarded a five-year contract by the U.S. Defense Department worth up to $15 billion. As part of the so-called the indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contract, Northrop will compete with the other companies to provide technology development for agencies engaged in counter-drug and counter-narcoterrorism operations. Northrop Grumman shares rose 0.3 percent to $78.40 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. (Reporting by  Chris Reiter )
