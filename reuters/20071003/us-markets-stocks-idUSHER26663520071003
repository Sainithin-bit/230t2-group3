 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. stocks dropped on Wednesday after a broker's weak outlook for chip makers drove a sell-off of technology shares and as investors worried monthly jobs data could show deterioration in the labor market. 

 Shares of technology companies had been top performers in recent weeks, but bellwethers such as Intel Corp ( INTC.O ) fell after Morgan Stanley said a price war in the chip sector is brewing. Investors also focused on Friday's release of September payrolls data, which may suggest the housing slump and credit market turmoil is seeping into the broader U.S. economy. "Investors have turned cautious, waiting for the employment number on Friday," said Frederic Dickson, senior vice president and market strategist at D.A. Davidson & Co. in Lake Oswego, Oregon. "In a perverse way, I think Wall Street is hoping for a slightly disappointing jobs report, but not a catastrophic one." Investors also consolidated profits for a second day, pulling down shares of plane maker Boeing Co. ( BA.N ) and General Electric Co. ( GE.N ), after these stocks helped drive the Dow industrials to yet another record above 14,000 on Monday. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  was down 79.26 points, or 0.56 percent, to end at 13,968.05. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  was down 7.04 points, or 0.46 percent, at 1,539.59. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  was down 17.68 points, or 0.64 percent, at 2,729.43. Intel was among the session's top drags after Morgan Stanley initiated coverage of the chip maker with an "underweight" rating and a price target of $22, saying it expects an inventory correction and aggressive price wars. Intel shares dropped 2.2 percent to $25.81 on the Nasdaq. Morgan Stanley also initiated coverage of Nvidia Corp. ( NVDA.O ) with an "underweight" rating. Nvidia shares fell 4.2 percent to $35.82 on the Nasdaq, their biggest slide in more than a month. Memory chip maker Micron Technology Inc. MU.N dropped 8.9 percent to $10.74 and was among the NYSE's biggest percentage losers after the company late Tuesday posted a quarterly loss, reversing a year-ago profit. The semiconductor index .SOXX finished down 2.1 percent, its biggest tumble in nearly a month. Micron's results and Morgan Stanley's comments combined to help sour the mood that had propelled technology stocks upward previously when hopes of further interest-rate cuts by the Federal Reserve were seen spurring business spending on technology. Shares of other tech bellwethers also fell, including International Business Machines Corp ( IBM.N ), whose stock was the top drag on the Dow. IBM dropped 1.7 percent to $116.40 on the NYSE. The European Commission said on Wednesday it had opened an in-depth investigation into plans by the tech services company to buy Swedish business software company Telelogic AB TLOG.ST. Boeing shares fell 1.1 percent to $104.72, while shares of GE shed 1.4 percent to $41.55. Exxon Mobil Corp( XOM.N ), the world's largest publicly traded oil company, ranked among the biggest losers in both the blue-chip Dow average and the S&P 500. Exxon Mobil fell 1 percent to close at $91.33 on the NYSE. Oil stocks have been under pressure since oil came off an $83.90 a barrel record set on September 20. U.S. crude for November delivery settled at $79.94 a barrel, down 11 cents on the New York Mercantile Exchange. In economic news, the Institute for Supply Management's nonmanufacturing index fell last month to a level slightly below economists' expectations but still showed the vast services sector of the economy was growing.  In bank news, Germany's Deutsche Bank AG ( DBKGn.DE ) forecast third-quarter net profit to rise to more than $2 billion and stuck to its 2008 targets despite big hits from global credit market problems.  A slightly disappointing Friday's jobs report, Dickson said, will raise the probability of another Fed rate cut, but "a catastrophic report will say, gee, the damage is already done, the Fed action may be too late and probably third- and fourth-quarter earnings numbers will be a problem." Trading was lighter than normal on the NYSE, with about 1.25 billion shares changing hands versus last year's estimated daily average of 1.84 billion. On Nasdaq, about 1.90 billion shares traded, below last year's daily average of 2.02 billion. Declining stocks outnumbered advancing ones by a ratio of about 7 to 4 on the NYSE and about 3 to 2 on Nasdaq.
