 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Citigroup Inc's ( C.N ) chief executive, Chuck Prince, wants to see a review of the losses and writedowns in its markets and banking business in the third quarter before deciding on potential management changes, the Financial Times said on its Web site, citing senior executives. 

 Prince is involved in the review, which colleagues say could prompt personnel changes, the FT said. People close to Prince said he believes that Michael Klein and Tom Maheras, who jointly head the company's markets and banking business, handled the turmoil in the credit markets well, the newspaper said. The report said that insiders believe the review could affect the prospects of Klein and Maheras, who are both seen as potential successors to Prince. Citi said in a statement that its leadership, including Prince, Klein and Maheras, had been looking into the issues raised by the market turmoil since the summer, the FT said. Citigroup was not immediately available for comment to Reuters.
