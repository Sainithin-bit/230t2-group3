 ZURICH/FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank ( DBKGn.DE ) and Credit Suisse ( CSGN.VX ) said on Wednesday they see big opportunities when the global credit crunch, which has whacked profits, starts to recede. 

 The upbeat statements struck a chord with investors who have piled back into banking stocks in recent days as banks reveal the full impact of market turmoil on their performances and try to look beyond the crisis. A rebound in the Dow Jones European Banking index .SX7P, which has risen 6.2 percent since September 25, suggests a glimmer of hope that the worst of the credit crunch may be over. Deutsche responded to pressure to reveal the cost of the credit turmoil, saying it expected net profit to rise to more than $2 billion in the third quarter and that it stood by a 2008 pretax profit target of 8.4 billion euros ($11.90 billion). This is despite taking charges of 700 million euros on its leveraged loan book and 1.5 billion euros on items such as structured credit products and mortgage-backed securities. "We see substantial opportunities in investment banking after this period of correction," said Deutsche's Chief Executive Josef Ackermann in a statement. Credit Suisse CEO Brady Dougan, who took the helm at the Swiss bank in May, sounded an optimistic note, saying he saw a chance for the financial institution to grab market share from rivals once markets get over the credit crisis. Credit Suisse, which over the past year appears to have mended its reputation for delivering a patchy performance, said on Monday it would take a hit from the credit crisis but that it would stay in the black in the third quarter. HICCUP? Rival UBS ( UBSN.VX ), which has suffered a fall from grace in recent months as an ill-timed expansion in fixed-income trade has taken its toll, said on Monday it would report its first quarterly loss in nine years. Investors are snapping up shares of UBS, Citigroup, Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank after the banks removed uncertainty over their exposures. Deutsche Bank's shares were up 2.22 percent at 10 a.m. EDT (1400 GMT) while Credit Suisse shares were trading 1.18 percent higher. Meanwhile shares in UBS, which have recovered as investors take the view that the bank has drawn a line under losses from a now defunct hedge fund, Dillon Read Capital Management, were 0.9 percent higher. UBS said on Monday it was writing down a net 4 billion Swiss francs ($3.42 billion) in its fixed-income portfolio and elsewhere, triggering a third-quarter loss of 600 million to 800 million Swiss francs, its first quarterly loss in nine years. Citigroup ( C.N ), the United States' largest bank by market value, also said on Monday it was expecting a fall of about 60 percent in third-quarter net income. Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, Citigroup's largest individual shareholder, said on Monday Citigroup's profit warning was a "mere hiccup" and that profits would recover in the fourth quarter. Shares in Britain's two biggest banks, HSBC ( HSBA.L ) and Royal Bank of Scotland ( RBS.L ), rose by 3.07 percent and 3.99 percent respectively on hopes that the worst of the credit squeeze is over. News that advisers to British lender Northern Rock NRK.L, one of the biggest casualties of the crisis which suffered a run on deposits last month, are talking to U.S. buyout firm JC Flowers over a rescue bid, also heartened investors. The stricken bank's shares, which have collapsed since it emerged that the lender's main source of funding on capital markets had dried up, were trading 11.4 percent higher.
