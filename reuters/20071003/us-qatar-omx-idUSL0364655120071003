 STOCKHOLM  (Reuters) - The Qatar Investment Authority wants Sweden's regulator to speed up a decision on its suitability as an owner of OMX OMX.ST so it comes at the same time as a ruling on rival Borse Dubai, daily Dagens Industri wrote in its Internet edition on Tuesday. 

 Quoting from Qatar's approval application, the newspaper said that failure to give a judgment about its and Dubai's suitability as owners of OMX at the same time would disadvantage OMX shareholders. "Qatar Holdings ability to buy shares in OMX can be affected seriously negatively and to the detriment of OMX shareholders if Qatar Holdings does not get a decision from the Financial Services Authority at the same time as Borse Dubai does," the paper quoted the document saying. Earlier in the day the QIA, through its Qatar Holding subsidiary, applied for approval to raise its stake in OMX to over 10 percent. Borse Dubai has teamed up with U.S. exchange group Nasdaq ( NDAQ.O ) in a bid for OMX, and the two groups said last week they controlled 47.6 percent of the Nordic firm, after raising their bid to 265 crowns per share. Borse Dubai and Nasdaq have already sought approval for ownership of OMX. Qatar has said it owns 9.98 percent of OMX shares.
