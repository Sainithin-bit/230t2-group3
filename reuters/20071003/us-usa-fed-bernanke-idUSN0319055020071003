 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke consulted with financial experts including Wall Street executives and former Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin as the credit market turmoil deepened in August, Bloomberg News said on Wednesday. 

 Bloomberg said Bernanke talked to Rubin the day after the Fed's August 7 meeting, when it left interest rates unchanged. Ultimately the Fed slashed its discount rate on August 17 and its benchmark federal funds rate a month later to shore up the financial system. Bernanke also held discussions with others such as Lewis Ranieri, founder of Hyperion Capital Management Inc., and Raymond Dalio, president of Bridgewater Associates. Bloomberg said the information on Bernanke's calls and contacts was originally obtained under the Freedom of Information Act by Kenneth H. Thomas, a lecturer at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School in Philadelphia. The conversations came amid the most severe credit crunch in a decade. The Fed's attempts to inject extra liquidity into the banking system failed to stem the crisis, leading to the cut in the discount rate. Bloomberg, citing a source familiar with the conversation, said Rubin told Bernanke that the Fed made the right decision on August 7, though many complained it had overlooked the deterioration in financial markets. Rubin is now chairman of the executive committee at Citigroup Inc. in New York. Bernanke consulted with others throughout the month, including investors, congressional officials and Bank of England Governor Mervyn King, Bloomberg said. Bernanke and King spoke in a telephone conversation on August 17, after the Fed's decision to cut the discount rate.
