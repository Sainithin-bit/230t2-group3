 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Yahoo Inc is mulling its options for Kelkoo, its online shopping comparison site. 

 Yahoo declined to comment on a report in the Financial Times that it was considering a possible sale of Kelkoo. However, in a statement, Yahoo spokesman Brian Mast said: "One of the priorities we have identified is improving the performance of Kelkoo -- our online shopping business. We are currently identifying the right leadership and team structure to achieve our business goals with that organization." Yahoo paid 475 million euros ($674 million) in cash for Paris-based Kelkoo in 2004.
