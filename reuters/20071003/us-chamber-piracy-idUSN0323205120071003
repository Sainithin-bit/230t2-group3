 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Business leaders called on the federal government on Wednesday to do more to combat product counterfeiting and piracy, which they said hurts the software, pharmaceutical and entertainment industries and threatens the overall U.S. economy. 

 The U.S. Chamber of Commerce wants the creation of a new White House post called "chief intellectual property enforcement officer," increased spending for border and law enforcement, and stepped-up coordination with industry and foreign governments. "We expect that many of these proposals will be incorporated into important legislation (in Congress)," NBC Universal Chief Executive Jeff Zucker said in a speech at the annual anti-piracy conference. NBC Universal is 80 percent owned by General Electric Co ( GE.N ), with the rest owned by French media and telecommunications group Vivendi ( VIV.PA ). The chamber released a national survey at the conference that said more than one in five Americans purchased counterfeit products last year. "The intellectual property of our key industries is under assault around the globe and we believe that IP protection is among a handful of issues that will determine America's competitiveness in the 21st century," Chamber of Commerce president Tom Donohue said in a statement.
