 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. private employers likely added 58,000 jobs in September, a private report showed on Wednesday, suggesting growth of between 90,000 and 100,000 in nonfarm payrolls during the same period. 

 ADP Employer Services, whose employment report was jointly developed with Macroeconomic Advisers LLC, also said it revised down the number of jobs created in August to 27,000 from 38,000. The number for September was bang in line with analysts' expectations for a reading of 58,000, setting up the market for the Labor Department's release of September's nonfarm payrolls report on Friday. "Today's number is probably the best point estimate of what we will see on Friday," Macroeconomic Advisers chairman Joel Prakken told Reuters. "If you take the 58,000 and add some allowance for government employment, which could rise sharply this month because of the expected reversal in quirky seasonal declines in the employment of teachers over the last couple of months, I think we will probably see a number on Friday that is between 90,000 to a 100,000." According to the latest Reuters poll of economists, the Labor Department data on Friday is expected to show that 94,000 non-farm payroll jobs were created in September after shedding 4,000 jobs in August, the first contraction in four years. Over the three months ending in September, estimated job growth in the ADP report averaged about 42,000, Prakken said. "That is below the long run trend growth of the labor force and normally you would expect growth like that to be associated with eventually some rise in the unemployment rate," he said. The jobless rate was estimated at 4.6 percent in August. Analysts polled by Reuters expect the unemployment rate to edge up to 4.7 percent in September. Prakken said September's ADP report was the third consecutive weak reading and confirmed the recent deceleration of employment. In September, employment in the construction sector fell by 20,000, the 12th decline in thirteen months, bringing the cumulative decline since August 2006 to 157,000, the report showed. The report also showed that employment in the financial sector dropped by 7,000 in September, the second consecutive monthly decline after nearly six years of uninterrupted growth. These are the two sectors of the economy hit hardest by the turmoil in credit markets, stemming from subprime mortgage problems and the slump in the housing sector. A separate survey by Challenger, Gray & Christmas showed planned U.S. lay-offs fell 9.7 percent to 71,739 in September. More than a third of the announced job cuts came from mortgage lenders, construction companies and real estate firms, reflecting the housing slowdown and subprime mortgage turmoil.
