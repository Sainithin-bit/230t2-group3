 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japan's transport ministry said on Tuesday that the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) will check the damaged battery from an All Nippon Airways ( 9202.T ) Dreamliner jet that made an emergency landing in western Japan last week. 
 The ministry said JAXA will conduct a CT-scan on the battery, which was made by Japan's GS Yuasa Corp ( 6674.T ), because the agency has the equipment to carry out the inspection. U.S. and Japanese aviation safety officials visited a GS Yuasa factory in Kyoto on Tuesday for a second day of investigations. They were joined by officials from Boeing Co ( BA.N ), maker of the Dreamliner 787 jet. (Reporting by  James Topham ; Editing by Edmund Klamann)
