 (Reuters) - Google Inc posted better-than-expected quarterly results from its core Internet business, bolstered by the introduction of new product listings during the important holiday shopping season. 
 Commentary: COLIN GILLIS, ANALYST, BGC FINANCIAL "Click prices are still declining, but it's better than expected. "The core business is a great business and the fourth-quarter is always a time for Google to shine. However, Motorola is still losing money and click rates still declined. They only declined 6 percent, but go back four or five quarters and click prices were improving. So mobile is still pressuring click prices."
