 DETROIT  (Reuters) - General Motors Corp ( GM.N ) on Thursday reported a 22.7 percent fall in April U.S. auto sales on an adjusted basis, led by a 32 percent decline in truck sales. 

 GM's overall sales fell to 260,922 vehicles in April from 311,687 in the same month a year earlier. The percentage fall was adjusted to reflect two more selling days last month compared with April 2007. Inventory fell to about 824,000 vehicles at the end of April, down about 206,000 vehicles from a year earlier to the lowest level since September 2005. GM said a two-month-old strike at supplier American Axle & Manufacturing ( AXL.N ) reduced the automaker's April production by about 130,000 vehicles.
