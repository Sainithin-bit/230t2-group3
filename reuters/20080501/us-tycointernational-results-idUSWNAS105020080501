 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Tyco International Ltd ( TYC.N ) reported higher quarterly profits from continuing operations on Thursday as four of the industrial conglomerate's five divisions, including its ADT security unit, posted double-digit increases in operating income. 

 Income from  continuing operations was $273 million or 56 cents a share, in the second quarter ended on March 28, up 66 percent from $164 million, or 33 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding special items, Tyco earned 67 cents per share. It was not immediately clear whether that figure was directly comparable with the profit of 58 cents per share analysts had expected, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue rose 8 percent to $4.87 billion, compared with Wall Street forecasts for sales of $4.98 billion. Net earnings were $280 million, or 57 cents per share, compared with $835 million, or $1.69 per share, a year earlier, when results included divisions that are no longer part of Tyco.
