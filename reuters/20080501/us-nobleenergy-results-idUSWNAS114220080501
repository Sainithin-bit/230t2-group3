 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Noble Energy Inc ( NBL.N ), an independent energy company, said on Thursday its first-quarter profit rose, boosted by an increase in oil and gas sales. 

 Profit in the quarter was $215 million, or $1.20 a share, compared with $212 million, or $1.22 a share in the same quarter a year earlier, when it had fewer shares outstanding. Excluding items, the company posted earnings of $2.05 a share. (Reporting by  Euan Rocha ; Editing by  Derek Caney )
