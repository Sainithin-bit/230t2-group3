 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Tyco International Ltd ( TYC.N ) reported higher-than-expected quarterly earnings from continuing operations on Thursday, but its shares fell 3.5 percent on concerns about the pace of sales growth, especially in Tyco's flow control segment. 

 Investors are disappointed the segment, which makes valves and temperature controls, only posted 7 percent "organic" sales growth, down from a double-digit pace in earlier quarters, said analyst Peter Bates of T. Rowe Price. "Core growth decelerated in the (flow control) segment," said Bates, whose firm owns about 12.8 million Tyco shares in several funds. "That disappointed people." Tyco's overall "organic" sales growth was 3.6 percent in the quarter, below the 4 percent to 5 percent range the company forecast in February and below some analysts' estimates. Tyco reported income from continuing operations before special charges of $326 million, or 67 cents a share, in the second quarter that ended March 28, almost double the year- earlier $167 million, or 33 cents per share. Analysts on average were expecting 58 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. JP Morgan analyst Stephen Tusa said a favorable tax rate supported results, but called them "a solid beat" and said a strong order backlog suggests profits may accelerate in the second half of Tyco's fiscal year. Tyco said revenue rose 8 percent to $4.87 billion, compared with Wall Street forecasts of $4.98 billion. Sales rose 4 percent at Tyco's ADT security division, its biggest, as strength in Asia and Latin America offset weakness in Europe and North America. Operating earnings rose 14 percent. RAISED OUTLOOK The flow control business, which makes valves and thermal controls, posted a 17 percent sales increase as profit increased 40 percent. Fire protection posted a 24 percent increase in operating income. In the electrical segment, profit almost tripled, reflecting better raw material spreads and improved productivity, Tyco said. The safety products division had lower operating income. Tyco raised its estimate of full-year earnings 5 cents a share to a range of $2.65 to $2.75, which compares with Wall Street estimates of $2.71. For the third quarter, the company expected sales growth of 8 percent. It forecast operating margins of about 10 percent before items, roughly the same as in the second quarter. Second-quarter net earnings were $280 million, or 57 cents per share, compared with $835 million, or $1.69 per share, a year earlier, when results included divisions that are no longer part of Tyco. The company's shares were down $1.54, or 3.3 percent, at $45.25 in afternoon New York Stock Exchange trading. Former subsidiary Tyco Electronics ( TEL.N ) also reported higher-than-expected results on Thursday, driven by global demand for components used in industry and infrastructure.
