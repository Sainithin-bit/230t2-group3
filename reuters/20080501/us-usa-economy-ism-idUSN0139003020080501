 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. factory activity contracted in April according to a report released on Thursday, although the level of retrenchment remained steady. 

 CONSTRUCTION SPENDING: U.S. construction spending fell a steeper-than-expected 1.1 percent in March after the prior month was revised sharply higher, a Commerce Department report showed on Thursday, with private home building suffering a record decline. Story: <ID:nN30547336> Table: <ID:nCAT002043>  KEY POINTS:  ISM MANUFACTURING: * The Institute for Supply Management said its index of national factory activity was unchanged in April from March at 48.6. A reading below 50 indicates a contraction in activity. * Economists' median forecast was for a result of 48.0, according to a Reuters poll. The 86 responses to the survey ranged from 45.5 to 50.0. * It was the third straight month of contraction for the headline PMI index, and the fourth reading below 50 in the past five months.  CONSTRUCTION SPENDING: * At a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $1.124 trillion, construction spending fell to its lowest reading in March since June 2005. * Private home building fell by a record 4.6 percent as the collapse of the country's housing market continued to hammer the industry. But private nonresidential construction spending, which advanced by 1.9 percent, hit an all-time high seasonally adjusted annual rate of $382 billion.  COMMENTS: IAN SHEPHERDSON, CHIEF U.S. ECONOMIST, HIGH FREQUENCY  ECONOMICS, VALHALLA, NEW YORK: ISM: "The April ISM manufacturing index was unchanged at 48.6, trivially above the consensus, 48.0. The details show orders unchanged at 46.5 while production nudged up marginally to 49.1 from 48.7. But employment dropped sharply, to a five-year low of 45.4, from 49.2. This was offset in the headline composite index by a rebound in the inventories index and a small increase in delivery times. "Based on historic experience the headline index is consistent with real GDP growth of about 1-1/2 percent, but this will likely prove too optimistic because of the unique, consumer/housing driven nature of this downturn. So far, manufacturing is playing only a bit part. "This will likely change as consumption weakens further, so we have not yet seen the floor for ISM in this cycle." DANA JOHNSON, CHIEF ECONOMIST, COMERICA, DALLAS: ISM: "It's another indication that the manufacturing sector is contracting but it's not contracting rapidly. In past recessions, it had been the more cyclical sensitive part of the economy. With an improving trade balance, it's holding up better than in the past." "The most difficult part is still in home building. We will see continued weakness in the service sector. We have not seen the worst of the contraction." CONSTRUCTION SPENDING: "The drag from home building will be substantial for this quarter. We could see a drop in the government sector with the drop in revenues." TONY CRESCENZI, CHIEF BOND MARKET STRATEGIST, MILLER, TABAK & CO. IN NEW YORK: "The factory sector seems to be holding up better than it normally does during a recession, maybe because of exports." "The ISM report indicates the depth of the recession is not yet great." JOSEPH TREVISANI, CHIEF MARKET ANALYST, FX SOLUTIONS, SADDLE RIVER, NEW JERSEY: "The ISM data shows manufacturing is not deteriorating further, and as long as we keep getting status-quo, non-deteriorating numbers, the market will buy the dollar. That's the psychology of the currency market right now. "Nobody can come up with a good reason to buy the euro right now. Euro-zone growth probably won't return to 2.5 percent and the ECB is not likely to raise interest rates. Compare that to the U.S., where all these months of rate cuts are working in the market. And if the data remains status quo, the Fed will not cut rates further, something I don't think it really wants to do anyway. MICHAEL DARDA, CHIEF ECONOMIST, MKM PARTNERS LLC, GREENWICH, CONNECTICUT: "It looks like we came in slightly above expectations, so this number is consistent with positive growth in economy. This is not a recessionary number for the overall economy, and it's one of the first readings we have for the second quarter. This is a very sharp slowdown, and it's possible we'll have a recession, but if it doesn't happen in next quarter, it won't happen. The idea that it is a deep and long collapse is just flatly incorrect. There's no evidence of that." TOM SOWANICK, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, CLEARBROOK FINANCIAL LLC, PRINCETON, NEW JERSEY: "It looks like the other ISMs, Chicago and Milwaukee, in that although the number is still below 50, it appears to be stabilizing. Export orders increased modestly, new orders were unchanged, prices paid went up a smidgen, but employment fell. Now, if earnings are still strong and employment is weakening then we may be going through another phase of accelerating productivity. Weaker employment should be expected but the fact that earnings are so strong, stocks should fare well." ALAN LANCZ, PRESIDENT, ALAN B. LANCZ & ASSOCIATES INC., AN INVESTMENT ADVISORY FIRM, TOLEDO, OHIO: "The economic numbers haven't looked that bad to tell you the truth, which is why we're seeing the market heading toward the higher end of its range. This confirms all that. There are a lot of shorts out there who were expecting disappointing numbers and so far the economic numbers haven't fulfilled their wishes. This is putting pressure on the shorts and plus, there's a lot of cash out there, that's why you're seeing the market trending up." KEVIN O'MARAH, CHIEF STRATEGIST OF AMR RESEARCH, BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS: "The implication of the ISM manufacturing number is a comfort for manufacturers but it's a negative for the economy because of rising commodity prices. Last month they were way up and inflationary pressure is going to find its way through. The top number is a comfort. Manufacturing is better equipped to adjust to this recession than people think. It's leaner and more agile than it has been in the past. That shows in the inventory numbers that keep on dropping. Exports keep going up so that's also a major piece. That allows manufacturers to do pretty well from a profit standpoint. Manufacturers in the U.S. are still making a buck."
   DAVID WATT, SENIOR CURRENCY STRATEGIST, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS, TORONTO: "We already got from the Chicago PMI that the manufacturing sector is holding on a little bit better than expected, and that the pricing environment remains somewhat worrisome given the Fed's lack of worries on that front. But the idea of the U.S. economy finding a bottom and inflation pressures lingering did factor into market thought before the FOMC and now we are seeing the FOMC was largely a non event. The data is positive for the dollar with the idea that manufacturing is finding a bottom, the U.S. economy is finding a bottom and price pressures may become a more pressing concern for the Fed."  MARKET REACTION: * BONDS: U.S. Treasury debt prices steady at higher levels. * CURRENCIES: U.S. dollar at session high. * STOCKS: Dow and S&P stock indexes remain higher. * RATE FUTURES: U.S. short-term interest rate futures pare gains slightly, point to 28 percent chance of June rate cut.
