 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Pacific Investment Management Co 
(PIMCO), the world's biggest bond fund, has asked between 5 and 
10 Wall Street banks to let recently dismissed employees know 
that there are vacancies at PIMCO, the Financial Times 
reported. 

  Quoting a conversation with Dick Weil, PIMCO's chief 
operating officer, the FT said PIMCO was looking to hire in 
areas such as mortgage securities trading and credit analysis.  Citigroup ( C.N ), Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ) and Merrill Lynch 
MER.N, among other Wall Street companies hurt by the global 
credit crunch, have cut jobs recently.  A PIMCO representative was not immediately available for 
comment.  (Reporting by  Aarthi Sivaraman ; Editing by  Louise Ireland )
