 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Chrysler LLC CBS.UL on Thursday reported a 23 percent decline in April U.S. auto sales to 147,751 vehicles. 

 Truck sales fell 25 percent to 108,187 vehicles, while car sales declined 19 percent to 39,564 units. Chrysler did not adjust its sales results for the number of selling days. On an adjusted basis, it would have shown a deeper percentage decline because there were two additional selling days in April this year compared with a year earlier.
