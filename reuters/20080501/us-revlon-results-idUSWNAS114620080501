 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Revlon Inc ( REV.N ) reported a much smaller quarterly net loss on Thursday, due in part to expenses being lower than they were a year ago when the cosmetics maker launched a new line of hair color. 

 Revlon, controlled by financier Ronald Perelman, said its first quarter net loss was $2.5 million, or nil per share, compared with a loss of $35.2 million, or 7 cents per share a year ago. (Reporting by  Martinne Geller , editing by Maureen Bavdek)
