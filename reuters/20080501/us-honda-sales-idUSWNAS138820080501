 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Honda Motor Co ( 7267.T ) said on Thursday its U.S. sales for April were estimated to have risen about 6 percent from a year ago to more 134,000 vehicles. 

 Honda said its preliminary sales results showed its Honda-brand sales increased to an all-time monthly high of 121,500 units. That compares with 111,226 units from a year ago. Sales for its luxury Acura brand dropped to about 12,900 units, down from 15,193 units from a year earlier. Honda said it would report final April sales numbers after technical difficulties are resolved. (Reporting by  Soyoung Kim )
