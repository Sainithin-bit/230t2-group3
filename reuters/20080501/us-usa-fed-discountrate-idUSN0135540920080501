 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve said on Thursday it had approved actions by five remaining regional Fed banks to lower the discount rate by a quarter percentage point to 2.25 percent. 

 The lower discount rate, which governs direct Fed loans to banks and broker-dealers, are effective immediately for the Fed banks in Boston, Philadelphia, Richmond, Minneapolis and Dallas. Discount rate cuts for the other seven Fed banks were approved on Wednesday, when the Fed also cut its benchmark federal funds rate target by a quarter percentage point to 2 percent.
