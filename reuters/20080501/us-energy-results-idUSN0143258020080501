 HOUSTON  (Reuters) - U.S. independent energy companies Apache Corp, Williams Cos Inc and Noble Energy Inc all reported higher first-quarter profits on Thursday, benefiting from gains in crude oil and natural gas prices. 

 Benchmark U.S. oil prices averaged a record of nearly $98 a barrel during the quarter, up nearly 70 percent from a year earlier, and natural gas futures rose nearly 30 percent. Apache's earnings more than doubled to $1.02 billion, or $3.03 per share, boosted by higher energy prices. Production growth was 4 percent, falling short of investor expectations, and the company's shares tumbled 6.3 percent. "I think the bottom line is that production was a fraction light," said Ben Dell, analyst at Bernstein Research. "In the exploration and production space, production growth is a focus for investors. Houston-based Apache said quarterly production was 557,631 barrels of oil equivalent (boe) per day, driven by higher oil output in the United States, the North Sea and Egypt. Revenue was $3.2 billion, up from $2 billion a year earlier. Williams, a natural gas producer based in Tulsa, Oklahoma, said first-quarter profit nearly quadrupled, topping Wall Street expectations. Earnings jumped to $500 million, or 84 cents per diluted share, from $134 million, or 22 cents per diluted share, in the same period a year ago. Adjusting for hedges, Williams reported profit from continuing operations of 57 cents per share. Analysts, on average, expected 51 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Analysts at Tudor, Pickering Holt & Co Securities told clients that Williams' results were "strong." The company, which has drilling operations in the Piceance and Powder River basins in Western Colorado and in Texas, said average daily domestic production rose 20 percent. Noble Energy's profits rose to $215 million, or $1.20 a share, from $212 million, or $1.22 a share, in the same quarter a year earlier, when it had fewer shares outstanding. Noble, based in Houston, said it plans to increase its 2008 capital program by 19 percent to $1.9 billion. The increase will fund new expansion in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, East Texas, and the Rocky Mountains. Shares of Williams edged up 22 cents to $35.72, while Noble slid 4 percent, or $3.40, to $83.42. Apache was off $8.42 at $126.26. All stocks trade on the New York Stock Exchange.
