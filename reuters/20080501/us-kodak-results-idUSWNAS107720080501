 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Photography company Eastman Kodak Co EK.N on Thursday said its quarterly loss narrowed as improved digital cameras sales helped offset higher costs for raw materials and the roll-out of it printer strategy. 

 Kodak said its loss was $114 million, or 40 cents a share, compared with a year-earlier loss of $175 million, or 61 cents a share. The world's top maker of photographic film, which says it has completed the major elements of a lengthy and expensive transformation into a smaller company that focuses on digital photography products and services, said total revenue rose 1 percent to $2.09 billion.
