 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - General Motors Corp ( GM.N ) Chief Executive Rick Wagoner on Thursday said the No. 1 U.S. automaker had not hit any obstacles yet that would force it to delay the planned 2010 launch of its plug-in hybrid, the Chevrolet Volt. 

 "So far we're on schedule," said Wagoner, who was speaking to reporters after a speech in San Francisco. Wagoner, who had earlier suggested that GM's target of launching the electric vehicle could slip, said key work on battery development for the new car was progressing well. "Our optimism is building," he said. Wagoner also said GM had declined to participate in ongoing contract talks aimed at ending a two-month strike at parts supplier American Axle & Manufacturing Holdings ( AXL.N ) but hoped for a quick resolution to the work stoppage.
