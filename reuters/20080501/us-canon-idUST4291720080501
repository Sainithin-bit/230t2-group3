 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japan's Canon Inc ( 7751.T ) plans to invest 60 billion yen ($575 million) to build a new toner cartridge plant in the United States, the Nikkei business daily reported on Friday. The new factory, which will feature fully automated assembly lines and will employ about 700 people, is expected to start operations as early as December 2009, the paper said. 

 Canon, which competes with Xerox Corp ( XRX.N ) and Ricoh Co ( 7752.T ) in copiers and printers, aims to meet overseas demand efficiently with less impact of currency fluctuation and rising transportation costs, the paper said. It added the factory would be built near a site occupied by its toner production subsidiary in Virginia. Canon officials were not immediately available for comments. (Reporting by Sachi Izumi)
