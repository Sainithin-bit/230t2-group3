 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Sun Microsystems Inc JAVA.O said on Thursday it would cut 1,500 to 2,500 jobs in the face of U.S. economic weakness and delays in orders from some customers. 

 Sun will take a charge of $130 million to $220 million in its fiscal fourth quarter to account for the cuts, executives said on a conference call following a disappointing quarterly earnings report.
