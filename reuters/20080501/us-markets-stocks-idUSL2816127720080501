 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Stocks rose on Thursday as a rebound in the dollar and retreating oil prices calmed fears about inflation, renewing investors' appetite for riskier assets, including undervalued technology shares. 

 The three major indexes closed at the highest level since the first half of January as equities extended a rally started in mid-March on optimism that credit markets and the economy have begun to stabilize. Investor confidence was on the mend a day after the Federal Reserve trimmed rates again and hinted at a pause in its recent campaign to lower borrowing costs. Financial stocks were the main beneficiaries, led by a nearly 7 percent surge in shares of American Express ( AXP.N ). The Nasdaq was powered by a 3.5 percent jump in shares of Apple Inc ( AAPL.O ) on news it will sell movies on iTunes the same day they are available on DVD, giving further momentum to the company's lucrative iPod franchise.  "Tech is a global sector, exposed to enterprising spending worldwide, and never have I seen tech this cheap," said David Bianco, chief U.S. equity strategist at UBS in New York. "So when you've got some signs of encouragement in the economy," he added, "I think people are feeling as if they can take advantage of the value seen in tech." The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  shot up 189.87 points, or 1.48 percent, to 13,010.00. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  surged 23.75 points, or 1.71 percent, to 1,409.34. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  climbed 67.91 points, or 2.81 percent, to 2,480.71. Apple's stock jumped 3.5 percent to $180.00 while RIM shares climbed 5.2 percent to $128.00 on the Nasdaq. Shares of chip maker Intel Corp ( INTC.O ), a technology bellwether, gained 4.6 percent at $23.29. The dollar's rise to a seven-week high against a basket of major currencies knocked crude oil prices lower. Crude, like many other commodities, is priced in dollars and becomes less affordable to overseas buyers when the greenback strengthens. Crude futures for June fell 94 cents to settle at $112.52 a barrel. Oil's decline and disappointing quarterly results from Exxon Mobil Corp ( XOM.N ), the biggest name in the U.S. oil sector, sent energy shares down sharply. Exxon shares dropped 3.6 percent to $89.70 on the NYSE. Oil and gas producer Apache Corp's ( APA.N ) shares slid 6.1 percent to $126.41. The S&P index of energy shares .GSPE dropped 2.2 percent. Oil's drop however, was a boon for retailers, which are vulnerable to high gas prices that deprive consumers of disposable income. The S&P retail index .RLX rose 3 percent. Shares of department store chain Macy's Inc ( M.N ) rose 4 percent to $26.30. Blue-chip financial shares also rose by similar proportions. Citigroup shares climbed 4.2 percent to $25.99 and shares of rival Bank of America ( BAC.N ) gained 4.9 percent to $39.39. AmEx gained 6.9 percent to $51.33, making it the Dow's biggest gainer.
