 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. consumer spending fell in April, despite personal income posting the largest increase in 11 months, a government report showed on Monday, pointing to lackluster consumption activity in the second quarter. 

 KEY POINTS: * The Commerce Department said spending slipped 0.1 percent after a revised 0.3 percent fall in March, previously reported as a 0.2 percent drop. * The reading was slightly better than market expectations for a 0.2 percent fall in spending. * Personal income rose 0.5 percent, the biggest increase since May last year, after falling by a revised 0.2 percent in March, which had been reported as a 0.3 percent decline in March. * Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast income to fall 0.2 percent in April. * Real disposable income surged 1.1 percent in April, boosted by tax cuts and increased social benefit payments under the government's record $787 billion stimulus package, the Commerce Department said. * Excluding the stimulus package, real disposable income increased 0.7 percent in April. * Savings jumped to a record annual rate of $620.2 billion as the savings rate rose to 5.7 percent in April, the highest level since February 1995, from 4.5 percent the previous month. COMMENTS: T.J. MARTA, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, MARTA ON THE MARKETS, SCOTCH PLAINS, NEW JERSEY: "The data that came out is bearish for fixed income. The consumer doesn't seem convinced that it's an ongoing benefit with the income increase. After careful consideration, the consumer is retrenching with the decline in spending. That means the government has to stimulate the economy more." SEAN SIMKO, FIXED INCOME PORTFOLIO MANAGER, SEI, OAKS, PENNSYLVANIA: "Core PCE is a stronger number than expected. It is a sign that inflation, though not a concern today, could definitely be a concern in the future. "Given softer consumption and the overall state of the economy it is probably a bit higher than you would expect it to be." BRIAN DOLAN, CHIEF CURRENCY STRATEGIST, FOREX.COM, BEDMINSTER, NEW JERSEY: "At first blush, the data looks a bit better than expected. It basically keeps the party going. This is a market that is in the process of selling the dollar against everything, buying commodities, and that should continue today. I look for the yen crosses to also do well. The move has taken on something of a self-fulfilling quality to it now. I disagree with the fundamental basis of this rally. I think the recovery hopes are premature. Still, it's going to be a lower dollar until further notice. The GM news also has some effect to the extent that it's a major negative for the U.S. and makes us look that much weaker relative to the rest of the world." PETER KENNY, MANAGING DIRECTOR, KNIGHT EQUITY MARKETS, JERSEY CITY, NEW JERSEY: "Very modest. A 0.1 percent in April versus unchanged in March. That's confirmation of a trend that is very friendly for the markets. The one resurgent fear that the markets have responded to most dramatically is the notion that inflation is right around the corner. As long as we continue to see a number like this, it takes some of the steam out of that argument, at least in the near-term." PETER BOOCKVAR, EQUITY STRATEGIST, MILLER TABAK & CO, NEW YORK: "The income data was skewed by the stimulus, where unemployment insurance was accelerated and extended. If you take that out it doesn't look as good as it seems. "The spending data was a little better than expected, but again, if you include PCE, spending is still running at a very sluggish pace. "The savings rate went up, but it's a government induced data point rather than related to jobs. "The ISM data at 10 am is going to be much more relevant to the market as this was impacted by the government stimulus." MARKET REACTION: STOCKS: U.S. stock index futures extend gains after data. BONDS: U.S. Treasury debt prices steady at lower levels. DOLLAR: U.S. dollar pares losses versus euro, yen.
