 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - President Barack Obama said on Monday that a court's approval of the sale of Chrysler's assets to a group led by Italy's Fiat SpA will allow the automaker to emerge stronger from bankruptcy. 

 Obama said in a statement that the decision "paves the way for the new Chrysler to successfully emerge from bankruptcy as a new, stronger, more competitive company for the future." (Reporting by  Caren Bohan ; Editing by  Stacey Joyce )
