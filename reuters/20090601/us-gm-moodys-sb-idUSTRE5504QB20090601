 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - General Motors Corp.'s bankruptcy filing probably won't directly trigger rating downgrades for suppliers or auto dealers, said Moody's Investors Service on Monday. 

 "We do not anticipate that GM's filing will directly contribute to material rating downgrades for issuers in related sectors. These include suppliers, automotive dealer groups, car rental companies, and retail and wholesale securitizations," wrote Moody's analyst Bruce Clark in a research note. The agency's ratings for U.S. companies had already reflected a high degree of bankruptcy risk for GM and "fundamental weaknesses" of the U.S. automotive industry. These include "the unprecedented collapse in retail demand, persistent levels of excess capacity, the shift in demand to smaller vehicles, and the need to pare brand portfolios and dealer networks," the note said.
