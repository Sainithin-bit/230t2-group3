 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Shares of General Motors Corp , which filed for bankruptcy protection earlier on Monday, slid as much as 36 percent to a low of 48 cents as they resumed trading ahead of their suspension by the New York Stock Exchange. 

 The NYSE said trading in GM shares will be suspended prior to the opening on June 2, and then the exchange would move to delist the stock. (Reporting by  Ellis Mnyandu ; Editing by Theodore d'Afflisio)
