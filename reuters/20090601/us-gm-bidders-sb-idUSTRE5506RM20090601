 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - General Motors Corp, which filed for bankruptcy protection on Monday, does not have any new parties lining up to bid on the company's assets, an attorney for the company said on Monday. 

 "There will be a hearing scheduled by the court to consider the proposed sale under section 363 of the bankruptcy code," said Stephen Karotkin, of Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP. "I'm not aware of any other parties who are interested to purchase substantially all of the assets of the company." A 363 sale is the sale of an asset clear of claims by creditors. Under a government-backed restructuring plan, the Obama administration would take a 60 percent stake in the reorganized company. The UAW would have a 17.5 percent stake, the Canadian government would own about 12 percent and GM bondholders would receive about 10 percent. Without other bidders, the government plan appears to be the best possible option for the company. A hearing on the plan is expected near the end of June, said Karotkin in an interview. Karotkin, together with Weil's Harvey Miller, is representing GM in bankruptcy court. "Hopefully the new plan will be effected expeditiously (and) the New GM will emerge quickly," he said. Weil has a team of at least 25 people working intensively on GM's restructuring, said Karotkin. While New GM is expected to emerge quickly from court protection, its shuttered plants, stranded equipment and other spurned assets would be left to liquidation in bankruptcy. Martin Bienenstock, chairman of the business solutions and governance department at Dewey & LeBoeuf LLP who helped design the "New GM, Old GM" structure, said his firm may have a role in New GM, though that role depends on the new governance configuration. The bankruptcy case is In re: General Motors Corp, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York, No. 09-50026. (Reporting by Chelsea Emery, editing by Gerald E. McCormick and Steve Orlofsky)
