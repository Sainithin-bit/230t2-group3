 TOKYO  (Reuters) - General Motors Corp said on Monday its sales in China grew 33.8 percent in January-May from the same period a year ago, adding that the bankrupt U.S. automaker's eight Chinese joint ventures and other local operations would continue to function normally. 

 "GM has a specific development plan in China for the next five years that demonstrates our great confidence in the country," Kevin Wale, president of GM China Group, said in a statement. (Reporting by  Chang-Ran Kim ; Editing by David Cowell)
