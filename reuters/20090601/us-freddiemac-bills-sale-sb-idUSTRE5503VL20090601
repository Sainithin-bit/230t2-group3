 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Freddie Mac FRE.P FRE.N said its sale of $2.5 billion of bills on Monday brought lower rates and drew mixed demand compared with the most recent sales of the same maturities. 

 Freddie Mac's $1 billion three-month bills due August 31, 2009 were sold at 0.160 percent, down from 0.180 percent for its $1 billion offering on May 26. Its $1 billion sale of six-month bills due November 30, 2009 were sold at a 0.275 percent rate, down from a 0.299 percent rate for $1 billion bills auctioned last week. In addition, Freddie Mac also sold $500 million in 12-month bills due June 1, 2010 at a 0.460 percent rate, down from 1.147 percent its sale of $500 million bills auctioned on December 8. Demand for the three-month bills was weaker than last week, with a bid-to-cover ratio of 3.68 compared with 3.96 on May 26, while demand was also weaker for the six-month bills at 3.27 against 4.17 last week. Demand for the 12-month bills was stronger at 4.16 versus 3.98 on December 8. A bid-to-cover ratio reflects the amount of bids compared with the amount offered. A higher ratio indicates stronger demand, a weaker ratio reflects weaker demand. Settlement for all bills is June 2. (Reporting by Caryn Trokie; Editing by  James Dalgleish )
