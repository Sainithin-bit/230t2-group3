 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Fitch Ratings on Monday cut its rating on General Motors Corp to D, or default, from C after the automaker filed for bankruptcy protection. 

 Fitch said it expects to re-rate the company after it emerges from bankruptcy and is unlikely to assign a rating higher than CCC, the seventh-highest junk rating. "Even with a successful navigation of the bankruptcy process, GM is likely to emerge with a leveraged capital structure," Fitch said in a statement. Fitch said recovery prospects appear low for GM bondholders, although final recoveries are highly uncertain as they will depend on the equity value of a restructured or new GM. Fitch kept its rating on GM's senior secured bank loans at CCC with an RR1 recovery rating, indicating that a full recovery is expected. Senior unsecured debt was downgraded to C with an RR6 recovery rating, indicating recoveries are expected to be between zero and 10 percent. (Reporting by  Dena Aubin ; Editing by  Padraic Cassidy )
