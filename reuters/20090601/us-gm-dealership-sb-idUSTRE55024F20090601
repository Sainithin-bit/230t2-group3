 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A General Motors Corp-owned dealership filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in New York City early on Monday, giving the ailing car maker an opening for a companywide bankruptcy filing in federal court in Manhattan. 

 GM is expected to file on Monday. Manhattan is favored as a venue in major bankruptcy cases for its proximity to the nation's top law firms and the experience of its judges. Having an affiliate with a pending case in the Southern District of New York gives GM the ability to file in that court. The GM dealership, Chevrolet-Saturn of Harlem Inc, listed assets and liabilities of "more than $1 billion" each. The largest creditors included Wilmington Trust Co, with $22.76 billion in bond debt, and GM's United Auto Workers union, with $20.56 billion in employee obligations, according to court documents. The dealership's filing was submitted by law firm Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP. The case is In re Chevrolet-Saturn of Harlem Inc, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan), No. 09-13558.
