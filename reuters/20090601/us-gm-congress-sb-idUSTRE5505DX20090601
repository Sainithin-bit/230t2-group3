 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - General Motors Corp Chief Executive Fritz Henderson and Chrysler President Jim Press will testify on Wednesday before a Senate panel exploring plans to close dealerships affiliated with both companies. 

 The Commerce Committee, chaired by Senator John Rockefeller of West Virginia, will also accept testimony from trade groups and dealers. GM's and Chrysler's intentions to terminate franchise agreements with more than 2,300 showrooms nationwide has prompted concern from dozens of lawmakers who contend the bankrupt companies are moving too quickly.
