 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama said on Monday he was confident General Motors Corp would emerge quickly from bankruptcy, saying the government is in a reluctant position as a controlling shareholder. 

 Obama, in remarks at the White House just hours after GM sought bankruptcy protection in New York, said GM would make decisions on plants, new products and day-to-day operations, not his administration. (Reporting by  John Crawley , editing by Maureen Bavdek)
