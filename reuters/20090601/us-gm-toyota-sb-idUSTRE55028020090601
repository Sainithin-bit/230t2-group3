 TOKYO  (Reuters) - The head of Toyota Motor Corp said on Monday he hoped to continue operations at a California-based joint venture factory with General Motors Corp, and would consider supporting the automaker if asked. 

 "It's not something we would bring up on our own, and we don't know enough about the restructuring plan," President Katsuaki Watanabe told a small group of reporters. "If some talk (about supporting GM) comes up, we would like to consider it earnestly." (Reporting by Nobuhiro Kubo)
