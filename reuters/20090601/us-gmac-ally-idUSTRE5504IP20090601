 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - GMAC LLC, which has gotten two federal bailouts in six months, rejected on Monday competitors' complaints that its Ally Bank unit is paying excessive interest rates to attract deposits. 

 The auto and mortgage lender was responding to a demand by the American Bankers Association that bank regulators limit Ally's rates, after GMAC got $12.5 billion of government aid. Ally dismissed the allegations as "highly inappropriate," calling the ABA's effort an unfair attempt to restrain competition. The lender is not a member of the trade group. "We intend to use all of our resources to deliver fairly priced credit to small businesses and consumers that need it," GMAC Chief Executive Alvaro de Molina said in a letter to ABA Chief Executive Edward Yingling. "These loans will be funded, in part, by deposits which offer an attractive return for consumers that have money to invest." Offering unusually high deposit yields can be a sign of distress, as it was last year when the now-failed Washington Mutual Inc WAMUQ.PK offered 5 percent yields on one-year certificates of deposit. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp last week clarified a rule that bars weaker banks from paying abnormally high rates. Ally was recently offering one of the three highest yields in seven of eight deposit categories, stretching from money market deposits to five-year CDs, the New York Times said on Sunday, citing data from Bankrate.com. For example, Ally offered a 2.80 percent yield on a 1-year CD, more than twice the national average of 1.20 percent. "ABA believes it is completely inappropriate, and indeed risky, for GMAC/Ally Bank to be allowed by the regulators to continue to pay rates well above the market," the group said in a letter to the FDIC. Some rivals have alleged that American International Group Inc ( AIG.N ) has been able to reduce insurance premiums after a series of government bailouts. Government watchdogs say the allegation is not supported by firm evidence. SURVIVAL GMAC's conversion to a bank holding company in December was a central part of the Detroit-based company's survival plan, and allowed it to get access to new government funding. Since December, GMAC has received $12.5 billion in government infusions, including $7.5 billion last month to boost capital and help it expand auto lending at Chrysler LLC. Last month, GMAC substituted the name Ally for its own name on its banking unit, in an effort to attract customers. It called Ally one of the best-capitalized U.S. banks. The company was among 19 big banks subjected to government "stress tests," and was found to have an $11.5 billion capital shortfall, by far the largest hole relative to its size. GMAC has suffered heavy losses since 2007 because the housing bubble burst and more consumers defaulted on their loans. The company is now the preferred lender to buyers of vehicles from General Motors Corp ( GM.N ) and Chrysler. Both automakers have sought bankruptcy protection. GMAC on Monday said that it has no plans to file for bankruptcy itself, and that it continues to meet all its obligations. GM and private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management LP CBS.UL have stakes in GMAC, and the U.S. Treasury Department owns about 35.4 percent, GMAC said in a May 29 regulatory filing. The ABA said it represents more than 95 percent of U.S. bank industry assets.
