 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Oil rose $1 to $80 a barrel on Wednesday as comments from U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke reaffirming his commitment to keeping interest rates low outweighed a report showing a build in U.S. crude stockpiles. 

 Bernanke told a House committee that a weak job market and low inflation should allow the central bank to keep rates low for an "extended period", easing concerns that rates could climb sooner than thought. Ultra-low interest rates have made stocks and investments in commodities more attractive over the past year. U.S. stock markets .N rose after the comments, while the dollar weakened. <USD/> U.S. crude for April traded up $1.14 to settle at $80 a barrel. London ICE Brent gained 84 cents to settle at $78.09 a barrel. Bernanke's comments outweighed weekly U.S. inventory data from the Energy Information Administration, which showed a larger-than-expected build in crude oil inventories last week on higher imports. "These were bearish inventory numbers. But it looks like the more Bernanke talks the lower the dollar goes and the higher equities go and that is what crude is reacting too," said Addison Armstrong of Tradition Energy. Distillate inventories fell less than forecast by analysts in the week to February 19, while gasoline stockpiles fell unexpectedly. A week-long refinery strike in France has ended, French oil major Total ( TOTF.PA ) said. The labor unrest threatened fuel supply in France and helped push up oil prices over the past week. Workers at five of Total's six French refineries voted to end their protest after Europe's biggest oil refiner pledged late on Tuesday not to shut or sell any plants apart from its Dunkirk site in the next five year, unions said. Britain's largest oil field, Buzzard, has started to increase output after maintenance cut production for more than a week.
