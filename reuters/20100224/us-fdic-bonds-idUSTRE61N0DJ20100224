 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp may start selling bonds tied to the assets of failed banks as soon as next month, according to the Bloomberg news website. 

 The first sales could include about $2 billion of the FDIC's remaining stakes in loans from Corus Bank CORS.PK and Franklin Bank ( FBTXQ.PK ), according to Bloomberg, citing people familiar with the matter. The agency would guarantee the debt, the report said. The FDIC also may sell parts of a re-securitization of about $2 billion of mortgage bonds without government-backed guarantees, Bloomberg said. The FDIC would insure the senior-ranked securities but is unlikely to sell or guarantee the junior securities, according to the report. A spokesman for the FDIC said in an e-mailed statement that the agency cannot comment on pending sales. The FDIC, which currently holds about $40 billion of assets from seized banks, last year sold part of its holdings in Corus and Franklin as structured loans, according to the report.
