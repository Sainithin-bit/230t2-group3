 BEIJING  (Reuters) - Google Inc ( GOOG.O ) has scrapped the China leg of a regional event to show software developers its first smartphone, the Nexus One, in Beijing, its second such move following its threatened pull-out from the country. 

 Google will introduce the sleek touchscreen phone to software developers in Hong Kong and Taiwan next week, but will not stage a similar event in Beijing as developers were originally expecting, said a source close to the company, speaking on condition of anonymity due to the situation's sensitivity. "If Google did not have such an issue with the Chinese government, they would have conducted a similar event in China too," the source said. Google's Beijing-based spokeswoman could not be reached for comment. (Reporting by Michael Wei and Jacqueline Wong; editing by  Doug Young )
