 MILAN  (Reuters) - A Milan court has convicted three Google Inc executives for the 2006 transmission of a video showing the bullying of a youth with Down syndrome, the judge in the case told Reuters on Wednesday. 

 The three were sentenced to six months in jail after being convicted of invasion of privacy, the judge said. A fourth executive was found not guilty.
