 (Reuters) - Euro zone retail sales fell sharply in March, pointing to weaker household demand, but sales in February were revised upwards, data showed on Wednesday. 

 ECONOMISTS' COMMENTS CARSTEN BRZESKI, ECONOMIST AT ING "The numbers are weakish and there is the regional divergence between the core countries where labor markets are improving and the periphery. On the bigger picture level -- first quarter GDP growth should be good, but the recovery remains mainly industry-driven and not broadly based. Retail sales now would be slightly down on the quarter, but then retail sales are the most volatile numbers, and are often revised more than once, so we should take them with a pinch of salt. The weakness in private consumption does not come as a surprise if you see that inflation has been picking up -- energy prices and food prices -- consumers are the first to feel that. But the data will not have any impact on ECB monetary policy-- if anything, the numbers would point to a deflationary impact from the higher food prices an energy, but this was known already last month and the month before and the ECB still started its tightening cycle." HOWARD ARCHER, ECONOMIST AT IHS GLOBAL INSIGHT "Even allowing for the fact that retail sales were likely dragged down in March by the later Easter in 2011, the drop is disappointing given the importance of consumer spending to growth prospects and the fact that it has been fragile through the euro zone's recovery so far. If the euro zone is to see sustained, decent growth in 2011, it needs consumers to increasingly step up to the plate. And worryingly, euro zone consumer confidence fell for a second month running in April, to be at a nine month low. Consumers were more worried about the economic situation and outlook in April and about their personal financial situations, although their concerns over jobs eased. Inflation expectations remained high, but at least stabilized. There was a sharp weakening in the indices relating to consumers' willingness to make purchases at present (fell to a nine-month low) and over the next 12-months (to a six-month low). The problem is that in recent times, it has not taken much for euro zone consumers to rein back their spending, and they do currently have significant matters to worry about. On the positive side, euro zone labor markets have shown recent overall modest improvement. However, purchasing power is being squeezed by rising inflation (euro zone consumer price inflation was at a 30-month high of 2.8 percent in April) and muted wage growth, while tighter fiscal policy is increasingly kicking in across the region. Furthermore, despite the recent modest overall improvement in labor markets, the euro zone unemployment rate is still elevated at 9.9 percent and it seems unlikely to fall markedly in the near term at least. On top of this, many consumers have significant worries about their long-term financial positions. As a result, consumers' propensity to buy is likely to remain relatively low in many euro zone countries. On a positive note, despite the marked drop in its retail sales in March, Germany still seems well placed for a significant pick up in consumer spending in 2011. Consumers in Germany are benefiting from high and rising employment and higher wage settlements, while it seems likely that there must be an element of pent-up demand after many years of muted spending. Having said that German consumers get particularly worried about inflation so there is still the very real possibility that they will be very careful in their spending for now at least."
