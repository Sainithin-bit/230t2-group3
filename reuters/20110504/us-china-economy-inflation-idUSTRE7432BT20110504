 HANOI  (Reuters) - China is aware the strong demand coming from high economic growth is among factors behind high inflation and will continue its existing policy effort to curb inflation, Deputy Finance Minister Li Yong said on Wednesday. 

 "(Raises in) interest rates and deposit ratio and also some other measures are being taken recently, and we will continue this process to curb inflation as well," Li told a news conference at the end of a meeting of ASEAN+3 finance chiefs. (Reporting by Aileen Wang; Writing by  Yoo Choonsik )
