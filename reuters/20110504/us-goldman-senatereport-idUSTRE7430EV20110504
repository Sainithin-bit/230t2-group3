 (Reuters) - A Senate report, which had accused Goldman Sachs ( GS.N ) of misleading clients and manipulating markets, was formally referred to the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which are reviewing its findings, Bloomberg said. 

 The Senate report, which was released in April, had accused Goldman of profiting at clients' expense as the mortgage market crashed in 2007. SEC spokesman John Nester declined to comment on the Bloomberg report to Reuters. (Reporting by  Sakthi Prasad  in Bangalore; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman)
