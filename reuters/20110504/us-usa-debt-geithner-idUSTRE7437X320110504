 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The following are highlights from Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner's talk on Wednesday on the economy and the federal budget to the Investment Company Institute's membership meeting. 

 GEITHNER ON FINANCIAL SECTOR REPAIRS: "I am confident we're going to come out of (this crisis) stronger because we were much more aggressive, much earlier, in recapitalizing our system, restructuring it and laying out a basic set of reforms so that we could lead the world to better balance of checks and balances." GEITHNER ON WHETHER THERE IS AN ALTERNATIVE TO THE DOLLAR AS A GLOBAL RESERVE CURRENCY: Over the longer term, as these economies (China, Brazil, Russia and others) get stronger, if they really open up their financial systems, if their currencies are really flexible, if they dismantle controls on capital movements, if they integrate more fully, then it's possible in a longer period of time you (will) see a more significant shift. But not until you see those changes happen. And they're at the very early changes. GEITHNER ON TALKS WITH CHINA NEXT WEEK: "We're trying to encourage China to let their exchange rate move in response to market forces more rapidly, to open up more opportunities to American producers for goods and services, and to make more progress on the next stage of their financial side. That means opening up the market for financial services, financial products and let more competition in." GEITHNER ON FISCAL CREDIBILITY Everyone is saying that the minimum test of credibility is we have to get deficits down to a level where the debt burden is falling as a share of the economy. That's the right, basic objective. GEITHNER ON CUTTING FISCAL DEFICIT: "It is the right time, and it is a necessary time, to try to build a bipartisan consensus on fiscal reforms that will get our debt on a path where it is (falling). It is very important to do that. "It is not something we can just delay. It is important we take this opportunity right now to lock in some reforms on the fiscal side that will restore balance going forward." GEITHNER ON INFLATION, FOCUS OF POLICY "At the moment the increase in gas prices that you're seeing ... they're putting a lot of pressure on working families in the United States but it's not translating into higher overall rates of inflation or a rise in inflation expectations..." "The focus of policy is still going to be and should be on how to make sure we have in place a sustainable expansion."
