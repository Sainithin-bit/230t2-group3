 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The pace of growth in the U.S. services sector unexpectedly eased in April to its lowest level since August 2010, according to an industry report released on Wednesday. 

 The Institute for Supply Management said its services index fell to 52.8 last month from 57.3 in March. That was well below economists' forecasts for 57.4, according to a Reuters survey. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the sector. The report's new orders index tumbled to its lowest level since December 2009, falling to 52.7 from 64.1. The employment gauge dipped to 51.9 from 53.7. "It's a weak indication not only in the headline figure, but also in the worst possible place: the orders component," said Pierre Ellis, senior economist at Decision Economics in New York. "This is a sector that is supposed to be relatively smooth in terms of growth so if it turns out to be more than transitory, this would be a clear indication of de-stabilization in the economy." U.S. stocks added to losses following the data, as did the U.S. dollar, while Treasuries extended gains. (Reporting by  Leah Schnurr , additional reporting by Ellen Freilich)
