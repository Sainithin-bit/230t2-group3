 LISBON  (Reuters) - Portugal's 78 billion euro EU/IMF bailout deal includes up to 12 billion euros for the banking sector to support recapitalization there and orders banks to raise their core Tier 1 capital ratios gradually, an official source close to the process said on Wednesday. 

 The source told Reuters banks will have to raise the ratio to 9 percent at the end of this year and to 10 percent at the end of 2012. That compares to the current central bank requirement of a minimum 8 percent ratio at the end of 2011. The government would help banks to recapitalize if they are unable to meet the targets, by temporarily taking stakes in the financial institutions. The bailout deal also envisages privatization revenues worth 5.3 billion euros until 2013. The bailout memorandum still has to be approved by the main opposition parties.
