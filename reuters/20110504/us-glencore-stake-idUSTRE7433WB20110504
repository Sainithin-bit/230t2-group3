 LONDON  (Reuters) - Glencore Chief Executive Ivan Glasenberg is the commodity trader's biggest shareholder, owning 18.1 percent of the firm prior to the listing, sources close to the deal said on Wednesday. 

 The former coal trader's stake will be reduced to 15.8 percent stake after the listing if it prices at the mid-point of its 480 to 580 pence per share range, and prior to a 10 percent overallotment option. Other top executives Daniel Mate and Telis Mistakidis each hold a 6.9 percent stake prior to the float, which will fall to 6 percent after the initial public offering (IPO).
