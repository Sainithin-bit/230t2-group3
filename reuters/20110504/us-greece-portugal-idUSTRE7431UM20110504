 ATHENS  (Reuters) - Greece on Wednesday welcomed a 78 billion euro bailout for Portugal, saying the deal would help ease market jitters. 

 "This agreement will contribute to reducing uncertainty in the markets, which is something all of Europe needs," government spokesman George Petalotis said in a statement e-mailed to Reuters. "I should also stress the importance of such an agreement reached by a caretaker government with broad support from political parties. This is a testament to the Portuguese government's ability to work together in times of crisis," he added. Greek officials would not comment on the terms of the bailout, saying full details had not been released yet. Caretaker Prime Minister Jose Socrates said the terms of the deal were easier for Portugal compared to the Greek and Irish bailouts. (Reporting by George Georgiopoulos)
