 LONDON  (Reuters) - Banks running the mega-float of commodities trader Glencore will get a cut of the biggest fee pot in a decade for a European listing, although they will have to split the potential $275 million with more advisers. 

 Glencore needs to raise its full target of $11 billion for fees to reach that level. The 23 investment banks working on the offering would also have to earn a $82.5 million commission in full, on top of the 1.75 percent cut of the offering they are entitled to. Citigroup and Morgan Stanley look set to take home the biggest chunk of fees, after Glencore said they would get an extra commission. With the share sale potentially ranking as London's biggest ever, even if the fees fall short of the maximum possible, Glencore's listing will be far more lucrative than any other European one in the last 10 years. Fierce competition to win the mandate put Glencore in a good negotiating position to push down the total payout, although the 1.75 percent cut earmarked for underwriters is still in line with the average levels paid by other European companies. Of recent share offerings of over $1 billion, only Russian internet investment company Mail.ru paid out an unusually high 3.8 percent in fees when it listed in November. Glencore is paying out $435 million in all expenses, including fees for lawyers and administrative listing costs, although the bulk of that goes to a raft of banks. NINE TO 23... The number of banks featuring on Glencore's London and Hong Kong offering has jumped from nine to 23, the company revealed on Wednesday, making it one of the largest groups ever pulled together to work on a listing. Only one of the biggest fee-paying European firms to IPO in the last 10 years, Russian energy firm Rosneft, featured more banks on its deal -- although it only paid $130 million in fees, according to Thomson Reuters and Freeman Consulting data. Citi and Morgan Stanley are the only two joint sponsors on the deal, although along with Credit Suisse they also landed the top title of joint global coordinators. Lower ranking members of the syndicate, many of whom also won't get credit in advisory league tables for the deal, are likely to receive a much smaller slice. Most of the newer additions at the bottom of the advisory hierarchy have lending ties with Glencore. These include ABN Amro, Bank of China, Commerzbank, Credit Agricole, DBS, HSBC, ING, Mizuho, Natixis, Rabobank, Royal Bank of Scotland, Santander and Standard Chartered. Russia's Sberbank is one stand-out exception, having not featured on Glencore's recent loan deals, and marks a coup for a the lender that has only recently branched out into investment banking as it rivals peer VTB Capital. Sberbank said it got the mandate as a result of "various business relations" with Glencore, including jointly acting as lenders to other Russian companies.
