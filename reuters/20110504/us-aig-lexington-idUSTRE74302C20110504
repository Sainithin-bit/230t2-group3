 (Reuters) - A unit of bailed-out insurer American International Group must pay $86.7 million to a U.S.-based unit of a Belgian bank over a dispute involving an investor in life insurance policies, the Wall Street Journal reported. 

 The American Arbitration Association panel, which ordered the payment, ruled 2-1 in favor of Lonsdale LLC, a unit of KBC Group NV, based in Belgium. Its ruling went against AIG's life insurance unit, Lexington Insurance Co. Both Lexington and Lonsdale alleged breaches of a complex credit-insurance agreement, the paper reported on Tuesday. The arbitrators who ruled in favor of Lonsdale said Lexington failed to prove that policies were originated through a prohibited act or that Lonsdale concealed any material fact. A spokesman for AIG declined to comment to the Journal. The company also declined to comment when contacted by Reuters. (Reporting by  Siddharth Cavale  in Bangalore. Editing by Robert MacMillan)
