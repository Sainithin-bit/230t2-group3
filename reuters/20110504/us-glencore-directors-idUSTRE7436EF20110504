 LONDON  (Reuters) - Glencore Chief Executive Ivan Glasenberg could be worth $10 billion after the commodities trader makes its debut later this month, but he is not the firm's only member of staff set to become a paper billionaire. 

 Following are brief profiles of Glencore's other main shareholding directors and how much they are set to be worth, prior to the exercise of an over-allotment option and if the company prices its float at the mid-point of its price range. DANIEL FRANCISCO MATE BADENES, 47 * Stands to own a 6 percent stake post-IPO -- making him worth around 2.2 billion pounds ($3.5 billion). Three years after joining Glencore's Madrid office in 1988, where he gained expertise in metals transactions and logistics in Spain and North Africa, Mate Badenes moved to the company's zinc and lead commodity department in Switzerland. He became co-director of Glencore's zinc, copper and lead commodity department in 2000, jointly overseeing its marketing business and industrial assets with Aristotelis Mistakidis. Mate Badenes, who has degrees in both economics and law, is also a director of Peruvian zinc and silver miner Volcan. ARISTOTELIS MISTAKIDIS, 49 * Stands to own a 6 percent stake post-IPO -- making him worth around 2.2 billion pounds. Mistakidis, who was born in Greece but has British nationality, joined Glencore in 1993 and became co-director of its zinc, copper and lead commodity department in 2000. He is also a director of Katanga Mining and Recylex and is chairman of Glencore unit Mopani Copper Mines. The London School of Economics graduate previously spent six years working at U.S. agribusiness and trading giant Cargill. TOR PETERSON, 46 * Stands to own a 5.3 percent stake post-IPO -- making him worth around 1.9 billion pounds. Peterson succeeded Glasenberg as director of Glencore's coal and coke commodity department in 2002, 10 years after joining the company as a marketer, responsible for various regions including Colombia, Russia and Europe. A political science and French graduate from Duke University, he previously spent five years working for Phibro-Salomon in New York, London and the Ivory Coast. ALEX BEARD, 43 * Stands to own a 4.6 percent stake post-IPO -- making him worth around 1.7 billion pounds. Having worked for Glencore since 1995, Beard was made director of its oil commodity department in February 2007, overseeing the company's crude oil and oil products marketing, shipping, exploration and production and other oil-related investments. Beard, who worked in BP's crude oil department for five years, holds a masters degree in biochemistry from Oxford University. STEVEN KALMIN, 40 * Stands to own a 1 percent stake post-IPO -- making him worth around 365 million pounds. The Australian former accountant joined the Sydney office of Glencore's coal industrial unit in 1999, before moving to the company's head office in Baar, Switzerland in 2003. Kalmin, who has a Business degree from the University of Technology in Sydney, became Glencore's chief financial officer in 2005. (Editing by Mike Nesbit)
