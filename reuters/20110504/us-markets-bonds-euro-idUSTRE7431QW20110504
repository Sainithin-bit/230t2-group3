 LONDON  (Reuters) - Portuguese bond yields fell on Wednesday after Lisbon secured a 78 billion euro bailout, but market relief was limited with key details yet to be confirmed and lingering risks to the deal. 

 Portugal said late on Tuesday that a three-year package from the European Union and International Monetary Fund had been agreed to shore up the heavily-indebted country's finances. It is the third euro zone country to seek a bailout after Greece and Ireland. Yields fell across the Portuguese curve at the market open, tightening the 10-year spread over German Bunds by around 18 basis points to 677 bps. The cost of insuring Portuguese sovereign debt against default fell, with five-year credit default swaps down 25 bps at 620 bps, according to data monitor Markit. This means it costs 620,000 euros to protect 10 million euros of exposure to Portuguese bonds. The limited scale of the rally -- 10-year Portuguese yields remain above 10 percent -- showed investors were cautious, with the bailout still subject to cross-party approval in Portugal, and lingering question marks over whether objections from within Finland could stall the deal. "Even though we have clarity regarding the amount, the more interesting detail will be the interest rate that Portugal will have to pay on the loans so we are still waiting for this," said WestLB rate strategist Michael Leister. He said repayment terms similar to those on Greece's bailout loans were likely, and that if the rates were seen as too punitive any positive sentiment toward Portuguese debt could quickly reverse. In an immediate test of investors sentiment Portugal will sell short-term debt worth up to 1 billion euros later in the session. Demand is expected to be lifted by the bailout agreement. CORE SLIDE Yields rose across the German curve as demand for core debt dipped ahead of Thursday's European Central Bank meeting. Two-year debt came under the heaviest pressure, flattening the curve on fears that a hawkish tone would signal the next rise in interest rates would come in June instead of July. "Markets are growing increasingly nervous ahead of the ECB council meeting tomorrow... the risk is that Mr Trichet's press conference is more hawkish and the short end is going to remain on the defensive near term," said Nick Stamenkovic, rate strategist at RIA Capital Markets in Edinburgh. Money markets are split over whether to price in an interest rate rise in June, as strong expectations seen after the ECB's April meeting have faded due to a strengthening euro and uncertainty surrounding talk of a Greek debt restructuring. The 10-year German bond yield was 2 bps higher at 3.293 percent, while the two-year yield was 4.2 bps up at 1.91 percent. The two/10-year bond yield spread was last at 138 bps, matching its tightest since January 2009.
