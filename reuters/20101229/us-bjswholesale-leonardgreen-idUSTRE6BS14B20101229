 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Shares of BJ's Wholesale Club Inc BJ.N rose more than 6 percent on Wednesday after a report said buyout firm Leonard Green & Partners may make a hostile bid for the company. 

 The firm wants to see an auction begin in the coming weeks, the New York Post said, citing sources. "If it gets to mid-January and a sale has not started, there may be difficult conversations," one source close to the situation told the newspaper. However, BJ's board and management have promised to initiate an auction after the holidays, according to the Post. Leonard Green has "made it clear they have the potential to go hostile" with a BJ's bid, a source told the paper. BJ's market capitalization is $2.59 billion based on the current share price of $47.57. On an estimated 2011 price-to-earnings basis, BJ's trades at $17.65, a discount to its rival Costco Wholesale Corporation ( COST.O ), which is trading at $21.90. Last week, Leonard Green offered to buy fabric and crafts company Jo-Ann Stores Inc JAS.N for about $1.6 billion in cash, less than a month after the private equity firm took part in the buyout of clothing retailer J Crew Group Inc JCG.N. BJ's spokeswoman Cathy Maloney declined to comment. Leonard Green & Partners could not be reached for comment. BJ's shares were up 6.6 percent at $47.41 in afternoon trading.
