 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. prosecutors on Wednesday arrested a California woman on charges she provided inside financial information on technology companies to two hedge funds in exchange for illegal payments, marking the sixth recent arrest in their big probe into insider trading. 

 Here's a look at some of the publicly traded companies involved in the scandal. * Marvell Technology Group Ltd Winifred Jiau, who was arrested on Wednesday, is accused of providing confidential information about Marvell's public earnings announcements for the first and second quarters of fiscal 2008 to hedge funds, which then traded on the information, according to a criminal complaint. The complaint said she gave hedge fund portfolio managers specific quarterly revenue and gross margin figures as well as earnings per share figures. * Nvidia Corp Jiau is accused of providing detailed information on Nvidia's second-quarter earnings announcement in 2008, including a specific revenue number and information about a stock buyback. Nvidia spokesman Hector Marinez said Jiau had been a contractor at Nvidia before leaving the firm about a year ago. * Flextronics International Flextronics supplied camera and charger components to Apple Inc for its iPhone and iPod, according to an earlier complaint. In 2009, Walter Shimoon, a senior director of business development, allegedly told a hedge fund about plans for the iPad. Shimoon, who participated in contract negotiations with Apple, placed calls to hedge funds on his cellphone, prosecutors said. In those calls, some of which investigators said they monitored, he talked about sales figures for iPods and iPhones, and said the upcoming iPhone would have two cameras. In November 2009, Shimoon told a hedge fund employee, "that would really suck if you recorded all the calls." * Dell Inc A former Dell global supply manager, Daniel DeVore, pleaded guilty to wire fraud and conspiracy charges on December 10. Court documents show that he passed on information about the company's sales figures. Dell said DeVore was no longer with the company. * Advanced Micro Devices Inc A supply chain manager, Anthony Longoria, gave out revenue information, average sales prices, product sales figures and gross margin information to an unidentified hedge fund. He received some top-line revenue numbers on the chipmaker from a friend who worked in AMD's finance department. He leaked the tips to Richard Choo-Beng Lee, a hedge fund manager who has been cooperating with the investigators. * Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co A manager, Manosha Karunatilaka, provided product sales and shipping information to hedge funds and financial analysts. He also provided semiconductor orders data. Some of the telephone calls he made were routed through the FBI. (Compiled by Emily Chasan; Editing by Steve Orlofsky)
