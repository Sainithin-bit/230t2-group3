 LONDON  (Reuters) - With just a few trading sessions to go, commodities in the shape of copper and gold and U.S. over-the-counter stocks look to be 2010's big winners. 

 Copper has gained around 26.7 percent so far this year, followed by gold with 26.4 percent and the Nasdaq stock index  .IXIC , which has gained 18.5 percent. Which asset was the biggest loser on a list compiled by Reuters? Greek 10-year government debt, which has lost 34.7 percent in dollar terms and 28.7 percent in euros. Many of the 2010 gains made by riskier assets such as stocks came after an August speech by Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke. In it, Bernanke made clear the Fed was willing to buy more assets in order to pump liquidity into the then-slowing U.S. economy. (Writing by  Jeremy Gaunt , Editing by Catherine Evans)
