 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Prosecutors on Wednesday arrested a California woman on charges of leaking secrets about technology companies to two hedge funds in exchange for illegal payments, marking the sixth recent arrest in their big probe into insider trading. 

 A list of some of the people involved is below. WINIFRED JIAU Jiau, 43, was arrested on Wednesday, as prosecutors accused her of selling inside information about publicly-traded companies including computer chipmakers Marvell Technology Group Ltd and Nvidia Corp to hedge funds. Jiau worked as a consultant for expert network firm Primary Global Research, according to details in the complaint. She was ordered detained by U.S. Magistrate Judge Nandor Vadas at a hearing Wednesday in San Francisco and a bail hearing is set for January 3. WALTER SHIMOON Shimoon, who was arrested earlier this month, was a senior director of business development at Flextronics International, and is accused of providing confidential information to a hedge fund about Flextronics and Apple Inc, according to a complaint this month. He is currently free on $150,000 bail. MARK ANTHONY "TONY" LONGORIA Longoria, a Round Rock, Texas-based supply chain manager for Advanced Micro Devices Inc, was arrested earlier this month and is accused of providing confidential details about revenue and sales to a hedge fund. He was also a consultant for Primary Global. MANOSHA KARUNATILAKA Karunatilaka, a manager at Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company North America in Burlington, Massachusetts, is accused of having a conversation with a technology analyst at a financial firm in which he provided material nonpublic information about his company and its customers. Karunatilaka was also a consultant for Primary Global from 2007 to 2010, and his role at Taiwan Semiconductor included forecasting, planning, sales and marketing, according to a Primary Global document. He was arrested earlier this month. JAMES FLEISHMAN Fleishman, 41, of Santa Clara, California was an account executive responsible for attracting new clients to Primary Global Research. He was arrested earlier this month on charges that he arranged for hedge funds to speak to consultants, knowing the consultants would provide inside information to the funds. He has been placed on leave by Primary Global DANIEL DEVORE DeVore, a global supply manager at Dell Computer, is cooperating with the probe. He has pleaded guilty to securities fraud in connection with his work as an "expert network" consultant for Primary Global Research, Guidepoint Global and Vista, according to court papers. DON CHING TRANG CHU Chu, an executive at California research firm Primary Global Research, was arrested in November on charges that he introduced hedge funds to executives who gave them insider trading information. Primary Global said it has cut ties with Chu, who had worked as a Taiwan Liaison at Primary Global. RICHARD CHOO-BENG LEE Lee pleaded guilty last year in the insider-trading prosecution of Galleon Group hedge fund founder Raj Rajaratnam and 22 other traders. Lee, who once worked for hedge fund SAC Capital, was identified as a cooperating witness in some of the recent complaints. DR. YVES BENHAMOU Benhamou, a French infectious disease specialist, was arrested in November on charges of passing illegal tips about negative results in an experimental Human Genome Sciences Inc drug trial to FrontPoint, a hedge fund owned by Morgan Stanley. Benhamou's bail was set at $3 million. FrontPoint, after facing big redemptions, elected to shut down the healthcare funds linked to the scandal. Benhamou does not appear to be linked to the recent arrests, but was affiliated with an expert network as well. (Reporting by  Emily Chasan ; Editing by  Bernard Orr )
