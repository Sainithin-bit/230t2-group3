 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - SAP AG must pay Oracle Corp prejudgment interest on a recent $1.3 billion copyright infringement verdict, but not at the formula suggested by Oracle, according to a judge's ruling filed on Tuesday. 

 Oracle had sought more than $211 million in interest after winning a high stakes trial in an Oakland federal courtroom last month. SAP argued in court filings that it shouldn't have to pay any interest. However, Europe's top software maker asked U.S. District Judge Phyllis Hamilton to use a different methodology should she decide interest was necessary. Hamilton endorsed SAP's formula on Tuesday, though she did not specify the amount SAP would pay. In its own court filing, SAP pegged the number at roughly $16.5 million. "While we believe that Oracle should only be awarded damages, we appreciate that the Court agreed with SAP on the proper calculation of interest in this case which dramatically lowered the amount," a spokesman for SAP said in an emailed statement. A representative for Oracle declined to comment. The case in U.S. District Court, Northern District of California is Oracle USA, Inc., et al. v. SAP AG, et al, 07-1658.
