 (Reuters) - Costco Wholesale Corp said March sales at stores open at least a year fell 5 percent on weakness in non-food categories and lower gasoline prices. 

 Analysts, on average, expected same-store sales at the largest U.S. warehouse club to fall 1.7 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data. A year ago, Costco's March same-store sales rose 7 percent. Total sales for the period fell 3 percent to $6.39 billion, Costco said. Same-store sales fell 2 percent in the company's U.S. operations, while they were down 13 percent internationally. A calendar shift due to the timing of Easter, which added a day of sales in March 2009, helped the company's total and comparable sales by about 1 to 2 percent. Costco's warehouse stores sell everything from bulk-sized packages of toilet paper and frozen foods to electronics. Its business has been pressured as shoppers avoid splurging on unnecessary items, like jewelry, in the recession. (Reporting by Vikram S Subhedar in Bangalore)
