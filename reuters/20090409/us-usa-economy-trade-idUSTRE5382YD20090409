 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The U.S. trade deficit shrank by 28.3 percent in February to its smallest since November 1999 as imports tumbled and exports managed to grow slightly in the face of shrinking global demand, a U.S. government report showed on Thursday. 

 The monthly trade gap totaled $26.0 billion, down more than $10 billion from the revised $36.2 billion deficit in January and marking a record seven consecutive months of decline. The February percentage drop was the steepest since a 34.9 percent fall in October 1996. Wall Street economists polled by Reuters before the report had forecast a February trade deficit of $36.4 billion. (Reporting by  David Lawder ; Editing by  Neil Stempleman )
