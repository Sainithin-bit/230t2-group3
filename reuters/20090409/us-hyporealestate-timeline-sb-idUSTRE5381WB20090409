 (Reuters) - The German government has unveiled a takeover offer for Hypo Real Estate HRXG.DEHRXG.DE, the investment bank that has been propped up with more than 100 billion euros ($132.8 billion) in guarantees, mostly from the state. 

 Following is a chronology of Hypo Real Estate's decline: November 2007: Hypo Real Estate says it has been affected by the financial market crisis, but would emerge from it strengthened. The company's shares stand at 37 euros. January 2008: Hypo Real Estate unexpectedly says it is taking a 390 million euro writedown on U.S. securities. The company's stock drops 35 percent to less than 22 euros. April 2008: U.S. financial investor J.C. Flowers and two other investors agree to buy almost a quarter of Hypo Real Estate for 1.1 billion euros. September 2008: A lifeline thrown by the German government collapses. It is replaced days later with a new plan comprising 50 billion euros support from the government and fellow banks. The stock falls below 5 euros. October 2008: Chief Executive Georg Funke steps down and Hypo becomes Germany's first listed bank to tap the government's 500 billion euro rescue fund. December 2008: German prosecutors probe whether Hypo disclosed its risks in a timely manner. Days before Christmas, Hypo says it will restructure its business and cut around 40 percent of its workforce. Its stock falls below 3 euros. January 2009: The German government pushes for legislation allowing it to nationalize companies so it can take a majority stake in Hypo. New CEO Axel Wieandt points to new financial holes in the bank's balance sheet. Shares slip below 2 euros. February 2009: The German government agrees on a legal proposal that would allow it to seize control of Hypo, shouldering aside shareholders including J.C. Flowers. March 2009: The German government says it will take a stake in Hypo Real Estate and plans to seek full control of the company, which expects to post losses for at least two more years. The stock stands at 1.14 euros, having recovered from levels as low as 0.64 euro. April 2009: Germany passes a law permitting the state to expropriate financially troubled banks. The law is tailored to Hypo Real Estate after the state failed to buy Flowers' stake. April 9, 2009: The government offers Hypo Real Estate's shareholders 1.39 euros per share, which is a 10 percent premium over the legal minimum offer.
