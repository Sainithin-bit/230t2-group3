 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - White House economic adviser Lawrence Summers said on Thursday that the United States benefits from the fact that the U.S. dollar is regarded as a safe currency and should protect its status. 

 Answering questions after an address at the Economic Club, Summers said the dollar and the strength of U.S. debt securities were "a source of strength" for the United States and that must be recognized. "On days when the markets are suggesting increased uncertainty, increased doubt about the global economy....those are days almost always when Treasury bond prices rise," Summers said. "So it's important to remember how fortunate we are as a country to have a currency and a bond market that is seen in every way as a source of strength and it's a huge responsibility for us to keep it that way." China has suggested that some thought should be given to letting some other measure of value be considered as the world's reserve currency, an idea the Obama administration has greeted coolly.
