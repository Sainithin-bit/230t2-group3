 (Reuters) - The German government offered 1.39 euros per share on Thursday to take over Hypo Real Estate (HRE) HRXG.DE, the stricken Munich-based lender it plans to seize control of and restructure. 

 Berlin pushed through a law earlier this month allowing it to expropriate shares in stricken banks for the first time in the post-war era, after failing to agree a takeover price with U.S. private equity investor J.C.
