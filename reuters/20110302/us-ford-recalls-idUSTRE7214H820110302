 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co ( F.N ) recalled more than 31,000 vehicles due to the risk of a possible fuel leak and electrical issues, according to a posting on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration website. 

 Ford recalled 23,688 Ford Ranger trucks saying the protective layer of an engine fuel line near the throttle body shield may not be properly installed, according to Wednesday's notice. Eventually this could lead to a fuel leak, but Ford said it was not aware of any fires related to this problem. The trucks, which are for the model year 2010, were built from October 2009 through May 2010 at the company's Twin Cities Assembly Plant. In a separate notice, Ford said it would recall more than 8,022 vehicles spanning seven models for the model year 2011 because their electrical system may short and prompt a vehicle fire. The models affected by this recall include the Ford Edge crossover, the Lincoln MKX crossover and the F-series line of pick-up trucks: the F-150, F-250, F-350, F-450 and F-550.
