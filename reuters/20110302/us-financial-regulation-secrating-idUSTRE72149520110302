 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Market regulators on Wednesday proposed to reduce money market mutual funds' reliance on credit-ratings. 

 The proposal by the Securities and Exchange Commission would remove a regulatory requirement for money market funds to invest in highly-rated securities. As required under current regulations, however, the funds' board of directors would still need to demonstrate that the underlying securities are of a high quality and pose little credit risk.
