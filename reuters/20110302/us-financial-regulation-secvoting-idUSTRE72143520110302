 WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The derivatives industry will get more time to comment on a contentious plan to restrict the voting power financial firms control in derivatives clearing and trading venues, after securities regulators moved to reopen the comment period on Wednesday. 

 The move represents the first major delay in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rule-writing agenda for over-the-counter derivatives under the Dodd-Frank law. The plan has been assailed by Wall Street as being too restrictive, although critics including the Justice Department have said the SEC's proposal to place limits on the voting power of big financial firms does not go far enough to address the control big banks hold in the over-the-counter derivatives market. The SEC reopened the comment period so the rule could be considered, with a separate proposal approved in a 5-0 vote on Wednesday establishing governance and operational requirements for clearinghouses. That proposal contains a laundry list of requirements for clearing agencies, including a rule ensuring an agency have the financial resources in place to cover a default by its largest member and requirements that aim to prevent clearinghouses from shutting out smaller firms that wish to join.
