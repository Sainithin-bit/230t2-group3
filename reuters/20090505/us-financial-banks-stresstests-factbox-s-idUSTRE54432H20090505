 (Reuters) - The U.S. government is conducting stress tests to assess the ability of the nation's largest 19 banks to cope with worse-than-expected financial conditions. 

 The banks and their regulators began the tests in February, and results are expected to be released on May 7. The results will determine how much additional capital banks would need under more adverse economic scenarios. Banks will be able to fill the capital hole by raising private funds or by accepting another round of taxpayer money. Below are details about the stress tests and the Treasury Department's related capital assistance program: STRESS TESTS: * Stress tests are being done at the largest 19 U.S. financial institutions with assets over $100 billion, a group that includes JPMorgan, Bank of America Corp, MetLife Inc, Citigroup Inc, Goldman Sachs, and GMAC. * The tests analyze banks' potential firm-wide losses, including those in loan securities portfolios, as well as from any off-balance sheet commitments and contingent liabilities/exposures over a 2-year period beginning in 2009. * The banks' conditions are being tested under two economic scenarios: a baseline scenario and a more adverse scenario. * Banks will forecast internal resources available to absorb losses, including pre-provision net revenue and allowance for loan losses. * Regulators will determine if the institution has a capital buffer sufficient to ensure the bank can perform its "vital role in the economy." ECONOMIC SCENARIOS: * Under the "baseline" scenario, economists at the Fed are assuming a contraction of 2 percent for the economy in 2009, followed by a quick rebound to 2.1 percent growth in 2010. It also assumes 8.4 percent unemployment this year and 8.8 percent in 2010. House prices are seen dropping 14 percent in 2009 and another 4 percent next year. * Under the "adverse" scenario, the economy is expected to contract as much as 3.3 percent this year and return to an anemic 0.5 percent growth next year. Unemployment is expected to rise as high as 8.9 percent this year and surge to 10.3 percent next year. Housing prices are seen falling 22 percent in 2009 and another 7 percent next year. * The Fed's own economic projections have been more optimistic than either scenario. CAPITAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM: * Once regulators determine the amount of extra capital required by a bank, it will have six months to raise private capital or it can participate in the Treasury's Capital Assistance Program (CAP). * There will be no explicit limit on the amount of capital that the government will provide to a bank under the CAP. * Capital provided under the CAP will be in the form of a preferred security that is convertible into common equity at a 10 percent discount to the price prevailing prior to February 9. * CAP securities will carry a 9 percent dividend yield and would be convertible at the issuer's option, subject to the approval of their regulator. * After seven years, the securities would automatically convert to common equity if not redeemed or converted by then. * With regulatory approval, banks will be able to request capital under the CAP in addition to preferred stock they received under the Treasury's prior Capital Purchase Program (CPP). They will be allowed to exchange the CPP preferred stock to the new CAP securities. * CAP recipients will be subject to executive compensation limits. They must detail how they plan to use the capital and how they will increase lending, and will be subject to limits on dividends and acquisitions. (Reporting by  Karey Wutkowski  and  Corbett B.
