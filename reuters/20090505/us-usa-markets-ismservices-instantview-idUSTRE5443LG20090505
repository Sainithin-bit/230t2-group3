 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The U.S. services sector contracted less severely in April, according to a report on Tuesday that will raise more hopes that the world's largest economy has hit bottom and may now begin to recover. 

 U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke on Tuesday yielded to Congressional demands for more transparency from the central bank, but drew the line at naming banks that use its lending programs. KEY POINTS: ISM SERVICES * The Institute for Supply Management's non-manufacturing index rose to 43.7 from 40.8 in March. * Economists had forecast a smaller rise to 42.0 in the index, where any reading below 50 denotes contraction. * The services sector represents about 80 percent of U.S. economic activity, including businesses like banks, airlines, hotels and restaurants. BERNANKE * The Fed will begin disclosing the number of borrowers under each program and provide more details on the credit it has extended, including measures of concentration of credit among borrowers. * "In addition, we will be providing monthly information on the collateral that is being taken under our various lending programs, including breakouts by types of collateral and by ratings categories," he said in prepared testimony. COMMENTS: KURT KARL, CHIEF US ECONOMIST, SWISS RE, NEW YORK: "The Fed's job these days seem to be talking up the economy. We are coming from a steep decline in the economy and it's not difficult to see that the second quarter may be better than the first. Still, as (Ben) Bernanke said, much will depend on how job losses play out. If they continue, they will overwhelm consumers and may jeopardize this upward momentum we've been seeing in some economic indicators and on markets. Liquidity seems to be improving across the board and that's what we need to sustain the recent rally and to keep growth going forward." PETER KENNY, MANAGING DIRECTOR, KNIGHT EQUITY MARKETS, JERSEY  CITY, NEW JERSEY: "Basically this is what the market has been anticipating. The contraction is slowing. The rate of slowing is slowing. That's what the market wants to see, and what they have been telling us is happening. It's an exclamation point. "That's why we haven't given up any of yesterday's gains. This data point will support yesterday's market action and that's significant."
