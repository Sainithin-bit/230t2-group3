 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - World stocks paused on Tuesday after reaching their highest levels in nearly four months as renewed concern over banks' capital dampened enthusiasm that the financial crisis and economic slowdown are abating. 

 The U.S. dollar rebounded from a one-month low versus the euro, amid worries over the banking sector and investors booked profits ahead of a European Central Bank meeting on Thursday. European shares were mixed and U.S. stocks dipped as falling oil prices hit energy shares and investors anticipated results from regulator capital tests at U.S. banks. About 10 of the 19 largest U.S. banks being "stress tested" will likely be told they must raise capital, according to a source familiar with the talks. Most banks undergoing the test will likely report results to shareholders on Friday, Jamie Dimon, chief executive officer of JPMorgan Chase & Co., said at a news conference. The tests aim to ensure bank stability should the recession drag on, placing further pressure on their balance sheets laden with risky consumer and commercial loans. But there are also signs that the economy and financial markets have stabilized since last fall could fuel a broader rally, and break momentum of profit-taking moves such as today's, investors said. A report on the U.S. service economy said an index of the sector rose more than expected in April to 43.7 from 40.8, closer to the 50 level that denotes equilibrium between contraction and expansion. "We've had a great run -- and I don't think the run is over -- but it will take a while to undo some of the damage that has been done over the past year or two," said Charles Lieberman, chief investment officer at Advisors Capital Management LLC, in Paramus, New Jersey. "We're in a convalescence period." Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke on Tuesday said markets were in "far better shape" today than last fall, helped by the Treasury program to inject up to $700 billion in capital to U.S. financial institutions and auto makers. But Robert Shiller, the Yale University economist who predicted the bubble in residential real estate, told Reuters a housing market bottom would probably be elusive until 2010. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  fell 16.09 points, or 0.19 percent, to 8,410.65. It earlier topped 8,458, for its highest intraday level since January 13. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  declined 3.44 points, or 0.38 percent, to 903.80, after Monday hitting its highest point since January 9. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  slipped 9.44 points, or 0.54 percent, to 1,754.12. Chevron ( CVX.N ) shares pressured the Dow, falling 1.4 percent at $65.75, as oil futures fell below $54 a barrel on falling energy demand. U.S. crude oil fell about 1.0 percent to $53.84 a barrel -- from its highest price this year near $55 as falling demand for energy and rising inventories offset feint signals of recovery in other markets. The KBW Bank index .BKX fell 1.6 percent, with Wells Fargo & Co ( WFC.N ) down 4.04 percent to $23.27, while Citigroup Inc ( C.N ) gained 3.44 percent to $3.31. Outside the U.S., the benchmark MSCI world equity index .MIWD00000PUS edged up 0.17 percent amid recent economic data suggesting the worse may be over for the global economy, and as one in three companies reporting first-quarter financial data so far has shown better-than-expected results. The FTSEurofirst 300 index  .FTEU3  rose 0.5 percent with the banking sector one of the biggest risers, while emerging stocks .MSCIEF rose one third of a percent. Germany's DAX  .GDAXI  fell 1.0 percent. Looking at first quarter financial results published to date, 66 percent of 326 companies in the S&P 500 index have reported earnings above analyst expectations, according to Thomson Reuters. U.S. companies in aggregate are reporting earnings 10.4 percent above estimates, which is above the long-term average of around 1.6 percent. In currencies, The euro fell 0.6 percent at $1.3317 from a previous session close of $1.3402. Against the Japanese yen, the dollar was little changed at 98.97. Investors sold euros after the currency hit a monthly high near $1.3440 amid uncertainty about Thursday's ECB meeting and results of stress tests on U.S. banks. Hopes that the world economy has already endured the worst of the recession had dried up safe-haven flows into the dollar. U.S. government debt prices declined, after the U.S. services sector report eased demand for Treasuries as a safe-haven investment, and as the Treasury began auctions of a record $71 billion in debt this week. Three-year Treasury notes declined 3/32, and their yields, which move inversely to price, climbed to 1.4 percent from 1.39 percent late on Monday. Benchmark 10-year notes fell 3/32 for a yield of 3.17 percent, its highest since November 24. (Additional reporting by  Richard Leong ,  Wanfeng Zhou  and  Leah Schnurr )
