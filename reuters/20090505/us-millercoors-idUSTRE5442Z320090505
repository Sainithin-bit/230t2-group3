 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - MillerCoors, the combined U.S. operations of SABMiller Plc ( SAB.L ) and Molson Coors Brewing Co ( TAP.N ) reported first-quarter net profit of $68.5 million on Tuesday and further accelerated the timing of some merger savings. 

 MillerCoors, the second-largest beer company in the United States with brands such as Miller Lite and Coors Light, said net sales in the quarter rose 3.8 percent to $1.72 billion. Domestic sales to wholesalers fell 1 percent in the quarter, while sales from wholesalers to retailers, a closer gauge of consumer demand, rose 0.4 percent. The company, which was formed in July 2008, also said it realized $50.1 million of merger-related cost-savings in the first quarter, which captured some savings originally planned for the second quarter. Molson Coors is due to report results later on Tuesday. (Reporting by  Martinne Geller , editing by Maureen Bavdek)
