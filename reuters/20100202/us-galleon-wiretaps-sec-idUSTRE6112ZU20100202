 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A legal fight intensified over access to wiretap evidence in the Galleon hedge fund insider trading case on Tuesday as an apparent cooperator admitted to crimes in a separate case and seven traders or lawyers pleaded not guilty. 

 Legal briefs made public in Manhattan federal court showed criminal prosecutors inadvertently gave civil securities regulators wiretap recordings that were intended only for lawyers defending charges against more than 20 people, including Galleon founder Raj Rajaratnam. His lawyers want the courts to suppress thousands of recordings, rarely if ever used in white-collar crime investigations, on grounds they were obtained unlawfully and violated his constitutional rights. One criminal law professor said he doubted the disclosure in the latest briefs would lead to an exclusory rule being triggered against the wiretap evidence "Usually it is applied to improprieties in the process of gathering the evidence and not the subsequent use of it," said Peter Henning, a criminal law professor at Wayne State University in Detroit. A judge was expected to rule on the issue shortly. As many as 14,000 interceptions of phone calls were made in the investigation involving Wall Street and Silicon Valley firms. Prosecutors have described it as the biggest hedge fund insider trading case in the United States. Employees of companies such as International Business Machines Corp, McKinsey & Co management consultants and the venture capital arm of Intel Corp have been charged. Meanwhile, former hedge fund manager David Slaine, cited in a defense brief as a government cooperator in the Galleon probe, has pleaded guilty to insider trading charges in a separate case, the Manhattan U.S. Attorney's office announced. A brief by an attorney for indicted former trader Zvi Goffer referred to a January 26 phone call with the SEC "to explore the failure of the SEC to have produced any consensual recordings, cooperation agreements, reports of interview or other material relevant to government cooperators Gautham Shankar and David Slaine." Shankar, a onetime proprietary trader at Schottenfeld in New York where Goffer also worked, pleaded guilty on October 20 last year to fraud charges in the insider trading conspiracy. A spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney declined to comment on whether or not Slaine, 50, formerly of Chelsey Capital of New York, was cooperating with investigators in Galleon or other probes. He pleaded guilty on December 18 to charges of making $3 million in illegal profits on tips given to a colleague by a now-imprisoned former UBS Securities LLC executive, prosecutors said on Tuesday. His lawyer, Stephen Kaufman, could not be reached for comment. The Wall Street Journal reported on January 16 that Slaine, a onetime Galleon employee, was a cooperating source used to tape conversations that led to a round of arrests on November 5. Those arrested included former Galleon employee Goffer, who pleaded not guilty along with six others in a brief court appearance on Tuesday to an indictment charging them with securities fraud and conspiracy to commit securities fraud. Charges against Goffer arose after he left Galleon and worked for trading firms Incremental Capital and Schottenfeld. Rajaratnam, 52, and former New Castle Funds LLC employee Danielle Chiesi have also pleaded not guilty. While the SEC and criminal prosecutors often coordinate with each other, there are limits on the information they can share in parallel civil and criminal cases. Court filings by prosecutors and Goffer's lawyer said the SEC had already been in possession since mid-December of some nonconsensual recordings related to Goffer. "Yesterday, the government learned that, in mid-December 2009, it inadvertently provided the SEC with recordings of certain communications intercepted," said a footnote to the letter brief of January 27 by U.S. prosecutor Jonathan Streeter. He told presiding U.S. District Court Judge Jed Rakoff that the SEC did not make any copies. In a separate brief dated January 29 and also made public on Tuesday, Goffer's lawyer Cynthia Monaco said an SEC lawyer told her she was "blind-copied" on a December 15 email by U.S. prosecutors sending the evidence to lawyers for defendants. "The government has turned over sealed wiretap communications without court authorization, leaving them subject to suppression," Monaco wrote. The Office of the U.S. Attorney said in response that prosecutors did not intentionally provide certain wiretap evidence to the SEC or blind copy the SEC. "There is no factual basis for these allegations and they are false," the office said in a letter to the judge. The case is SEC v Galleon Management LP, U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York No. 09-08811. (Reporting by Grant McCool; editing by Gerald E.
