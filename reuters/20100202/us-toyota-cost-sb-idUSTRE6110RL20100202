 NAGOYA, Japan  (Reuters) - A Toyota Motor Corp executive said on Tuesday that he did not know what the financial impact would be of a recall to fix its vehicles equipped with faulty accelerators. 

 "I got a free hand when dealing with this recall issue to do everything needed to put the customer first," Executive Vice President Shinichi Sasaki, in charge of quality, told a news conference at Toyota's office in Nagoya, central Japan. "So I am not aware of the cost that this issue will incur," he said, noting that Toyota's third-quarter results were due on Thursday. (Reporting by  Chang-Ran Kim )
