 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Dow Chemical Co ( DOW.N ) posted a higher-than-expected fourth-quarter profit on Tuesday, but said demand in the United States and Europe remained slack, sending its shares down nearly 2 percent. 

 While results were strong in countries like China and India, the largest U.S. chemical maker's prices and volumes fell in North America and Europe, indicating that those regions may not have fully recovered from the recession. "We see demand in emerging geographies continuing to show sustained growth, which bodes well for global growth," Chief Executive Andrew Liveris said in a statement. "Growth will continue to lag in the U.S. and Europe, however, as high unemployment persists and questions about the sustainability of government stimulus spending remain." Shares of Dow fell 49 cents, or 1.7 percent, to $28.14 in midday trading after rising more than 5 percent on Monday. "I think it's sell on the good news," Greenwich Consultants analyst Mike Judd said. "Quite frankly, why wouldn't you take profits here?" Sales rose in four of Dow's seven business units, including basic plastics, which posted a 17 percent jump. Dow bought rival Rohm & Haas last year for more than $16 billion in a deal that nearly cost the company its investment-grade credit rating. But it was necessary, executives said, to focus more on higher-margin specialty chemicals. Dow said it had repaid a loan it used to buy Rohm during the quarter and had cut its debt due in 2011 by 80 percent to $2.9 billion. Dow cut structural costs by $215 million in the quarter. "Not only are they generating cash from their businesses, but also from asset sales, and they're using that cash to pay down debt," Alembic Global Advisors analyst Hassan Ahmed said. "I see the quarter as being a handy beat." STYRON UPDATE Dow put its Styron unit up for sale last July and said at the time the unit could fetch $1 billion to $2 billion. It hopes to sell the unit, which makes polystyrene, rubber and latex, by the first quarter of 2010. The auction for Styron, which has been ongoing since the summer, is still progressing, the company said Tuesday. Bidders were asked to reconfirm their interest earlier this month in order to narrow the field of buyers, sources familiar with the matter said last month. It is unclear when the precise date for final bids is, though some bidders have been told that they will be able to make their bid during a particular week in the future, according to a source familiar with the matter. On a conference call with investors, Liveris said the sale process has been "robust" and that Dow could "have something to report in the next month or so." "We have more than a handful of people in the process still," Liveris said on a conference call with investors. Styron has mostly drawn interest from private equity firms, including Bain Capital, TPG Capital LP TPG.UL and Apollo Management LP APOLO.UL, sources said. BY THE NUMBERS The company reported net income of $87 million, or 8 cents per share, available to common stockholders, compared with a year-earlier loss of $1.55 billion, or $1.68 per share. Excluding one-time items, earnings were 18 cents per share. By that measure, analysts had expected 11 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose 14.9 percent to $12.47 billion, the Midland, Michigan-based company said. Analysts had expected $11.81 billion. Earnings from joint ventures, including a 50 percent stake in Dow Corning, jumped to $219 million from a year-earlier loss of $4 million and were nearly in line with pre-recession levels, the company said. Equity earnings of about $1 billion are expected for 2010, executives said on a conference call. For 2010, the company expects a tax rate of 10 percent to 15 percent, mostly due to its operations in emerging economies.
