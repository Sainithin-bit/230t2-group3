 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - American International Group Inc, which was bailed out with a $182.3 billion U.S. aid package, named a former top Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc lawyer as general counsel on Tuesday. 

 Thomas Russo, who joined law firm Patton Boggs LLP after Lehman's collapse due to the financial crisis, was named AIG's executive vice president for legal, compliance, regulatory affairs and government affairs, and general counsel. Russo was earlier chief legal officer of Lehman, which he joined in 1993. "I am excited to participate in a process at AIG to both repay the funds owed the U.S. taxpayers, and to continue to have a company in which all employees and stakeholders will be proud," Russo said in a statement. Russo fills the general counsel position that became vacant on December 30, when Anastasia Kelly resigned in protest over pay curbs imposed at the firm by U.S. pay czar Kenneth Feinberg. AIG also named Paulette Mullings Bradnock as senior vice president and director of internal audit. Bradnock, who joined AIG in 2005, was earlier deputy director and chief of staff for the internal audit division. Jeffrey Hurd, who was chief administrative officer, was named senior vice president, human resources and communications. Sandra Kapell was named vice president and global head of talent strategy and performance systems, reporting to Hurd. Michael Cowan, a former Merrill Lynch executive, was named senior vice president and chief administrative officer, succeeding Hurd. Christina Pretto was named senior vice president, communications, also reporting to Hurd. Pretto joined AIG last year as vice president, corporate media relations, from Citigroup Inc. AIG stock was up 1 cent at $23.97 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. (Reporting by  Paritosh Bansal ; Editing by Gunna Dickson and Steve Orlofsky)
