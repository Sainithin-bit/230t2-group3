 OMAHA, Nebraska  (Reuters) - Warren Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway Inc. ( BRKa.N ) ( BRKb.N ) recently bought large stakes in three railroads, said on Saturday that business would never be "sensational," yet its prospects had improved. 

 "What was a terrible business 30 years ago (is) a better business now," Buffett said at Berkshire's annual shareholder meeting. "It will never be a sensational business." Buffett called railroads a "very capital-intensive" business, but said there "isn't a whole lot of new capacity. ... It could be a lot better business than in the past." Shares of several railroads rose on Monday, April 9, after Berkshire disclosed in a regulatory filing the previous Friday that it had accumulated a 10.9 percent stake, worth $3.23 billion, in Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corp BNI.N. On April 9, Berkshire said it also spent $700 million for a stake in a second railroad company, and slightly less to invest in a third. The other companies' identities remain unclear. Major U.S. railroad companies whose shares rose April 9 on news of the Buffett investments included Burlington Northern, CSX Corp. ( CSX.N ), Norfolk Southern Corp. ( NSC.N ) and Union Pacific Corp ( UNP.N ).
