 OMAHA, Nebraska  (Reuters) - Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. ( BRKa.N )( BRKb.N ) said on Friday first-quarter profit rose 12 percent as earnings from insurance underwriting soared. 

 Net income for the Omaha, Nebraska-based insurance and investment company rose to $2.6 billion, or $1,682 per Class A share, from $2.31 billion, or $1,501, a year earlier. Revenue soared 45 percent to $32.92 billion. Operating profit, excluding investment gains and losses, rose 24 percent to $2.21 billion, or $1,434 per share, from $1.79 billion, or $1,160. Analysts on average expected profit of $1,447 per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Berkshire said its book value was $109.89 billion, up from $108.42 billion at year end. "Results looked solid," said Thomas Russo, who helps invest $3 billion at Gardner Russo & Gardner in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, including 8 percent in Berkshire. "It's a good start to the year, given that so much of their insurance results are in quarters still to come." Buffett two months ago had said insurance results should "deteriorate" but be "satisfactory" in 2007. He said Berkshire remained prepared to lose $6 billion from a single storm. Results were released ahead of Saturday's annual meeting in Omaha. The meeting is part of a weekend of events that Buffett dubs "Woodstock for Capitalists." Russo said he is attending for a 23rd straight year. Profit from insurance underwriting rose 82 percent to $601 million. Investment income from insurance rose 6 percent to $748 million, while profit in non-insurance businesses rose 16 percent to $894 million. Insurance premiums more than doubled to $13.51 billion, including about $7.1 billion from the Equitas reinsurance agreement that took effect on March 30. Berkshire's Class A shares closed Friday up $650 at $109,250 and its Class B shares rose $13.25 to $3,631. The Class A shares have risen 24 percent in the last year, while the S&P 500  .SPX  and insurance .GSPINSC indexes are up 15 percent and 14 percent, respectively.
