 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - As many as 20 million chickens currently on U.S. farms in several states may have been fed contaminated feed, the U.S. Agriculture Department said on Friday. 

 "We have learned that larger commercial contractors purchased and they used the (contaminated) feed," said USDA spokesman Keith Williams. USDA said it is in the process of notifying farms and states where the facilities are located. However, USDA declined to release specific details, adding the department is still establishing how long the contractors had been using the bad feed, contaminated with pet food that contained the industrial chemical melamine. U.S. officials have said there was an "extremely low" risk for humans who ate meat from birds that consumed the tainted feed and no food recalls are planned. Currently, USDA is requesting that the chickens be held on farms until the government can complete a risk assessment to rule out any threat to humans from eating the meat before the birds can be processed. The review, which is being conducted by the Food and Drug Administration, Environmental Protection Agency and USDA, could come as early as Monday. Two high-ranking Democrats in Congress said the discovery showed how quickly a problem can move through the food chain. Melamine was identified at first as a contaminant in pet food. "I agree these birds should be held until their safety is confirmed ... These results have great implications for producers and consumers," said Senate Agriculture Committee chairman Tom Harkin. The Iowa Democrat has called for an independent audit of the U.S. food safety system. Connecticut Democrat Rose DeLauro, chair of the House Appropriations subcommittee that oversees FDA, said "this latest disclosure ... demonstrates our food safety system needs to be reformed." DeLauro said FDA was slow to realize melamine would reach the human food supply. FDA should be given power to order recalls, rather than ask for them, she said, and it needs more authority to inspect food plants. The birds were among millions believed to have been given pet food containing melamine, a chemical used in plastics and fertilizer. It is uncertain how many chickens have been processed and made their way to U.S. retail stores. "We'll continue to run that down," said Williams. He added that so far tests by FDA have not indicated a presence of melamine in the chicken feed, most likely because the tests "only get so sensitive." But the government still considers the feed to be contaminated. An estimated 9 billion U.S. chickens are slaughtered each year. Melamine has been found in wheat gluten and rice protein imported from China for use in some pet foods, leading to a recall of more than 100 brands. The pet food was later mixed into feed given to poultry and hogs. Earlier in the week, USDA said as many as 3.1 million chickens at 38 farms in Indiana may have been given contaminated feed in early February and many were slaughtered for human food just a few weeks later. Additionally, some 6,000 hogs in six states -- California, Kansas, New York, North Carolina, South Carolina and Utah -- may have eaten tainted feed. USDA said more than 5,600 of the hogs are still living on the farm.
