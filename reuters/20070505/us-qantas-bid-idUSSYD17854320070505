 SYDNEY  (Reuters) - The group bidding for Australia's Qantas Airways Ltd. ( QAN.AX ) said on Saturday it would press on with the A$11 billion ($9 billion) takeover offer after winning last-minute backing from a large U.S. investor. 

 The Airline Partners Australia (APA) consortium said it would appeal to regulators to keep the bid alive following the unidentified investor's late intervention, which came just hours after it said the offer had not won enough support to proceed. APA, which includes Macquarie Bank Ltd. MBL.AX, had earlier said it appeared that less than 50 percent of Qantas shareholders had accepted the bid by a Friday evening deadline, meaning the world's largest airline buyout would not go ahead. "However, subsequently on Friday, APA received an acceptance from a large investor, which would be sufficient to take acceptances for Qantas shares to more than 50 percent," APA said in a statement. "APA intends to make submissions to the Takeover Panel to allow the offer to continue." The sale of the national icon, dubbed the Flying Kangaroo, has faced political and strong union opposition, but was backed by the Australian government as well as Qantas management. A Qantas spokesman said its board would hold an emergency meeting on Saturday and that it would issue a statement to the Australian Stock Exchange on Monday on the outcome of the discussion. Fabian Babich, a BBY analyst said news of APA gaining acceptance from a major U.S. investor could sway more investors to accept the offer, potentially allowing APA to get 70 percent of acceptances and push the deal through. "It is also possible that APA would lower the minimum acceptance condition to 60 percent ... This whole deal has been a real financial drama and I wouldn't rule out that scenario," Babich said. HANGING IN THE BALANCE APA said that including the latest acceptance from the U.S. investor, it has gained control of 50.6 percent of the airline's shares and has received acceptances from 58 percent of shareholders. The bid group needs acceptance from 70 percent of shareholders to win the bid, but 50 percent would have allow it to extend the offer for another two weeks. Qantas shares closed on Friday at A$5.38. APA's bid valued Qantas at A$5.45 a share. The offer has been hanging in the balance for weeks after some key shareholders said the offer was too low, forcing the bidders to ease their conditions and offer shareholders incentives to accept. Balanced Equity Management, which controls about 4 percent of the airline's stock, and UBS Global Asset Management, with 6 percent, have indicated previously they would not back the bid. The bid had been strongly supported by Qantas senior management, including Chief Executive Geoff Dixon and Chairman Margaret Jackson, who warned recently that Qantas shares would fall if the bid was not accepted. The bid group also includes private equity firm Texas Pacific Group TPG.UL, Allco Equity Partners AEP.AX, Allco Finance Group AFG.AX and Canadian investment firm Onex Corp. ( OCX.TO ).
