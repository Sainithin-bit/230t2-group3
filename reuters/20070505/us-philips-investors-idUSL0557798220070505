 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - The chief executive of Dutch group Philips ( PHG.AS ) has held talks with financial investors but believes the TVs-to-hospital equipment maker would not be an easy target, he told a German newspaper. 

 "I have spoken several times with financial investors," Gerard Kleisterlee told the Sueddeutsche Zeitung in an interview published on Saturday, when asked whether the 35 billion-euro ($48 billion) market cap was low enough to attract investors. Asked whether financial investors could be interested in breaking up the group and selling off the pieces, he answered: "Believe me, it's not that easy." "Whether it is a computer tomograph or a light bulb -- all our products live from our strong brand, from our research and distribution. You cannot simply strip out parts and believe they sell themselves just as well elsewhere," he added. "What would our medical technology be (worth) without the name Philips? Financial investors recognize this value," Kleisterlee continued. Philips sold its semiconductor unit for more than 4 billion euros last year to private equity investors Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, Silver Lake, AlpInvest, Bain Capital and Apax amid growing interest in the sector from financial investors. Dutch competition authority NMa said earlier this year it expected merger and acquisition activity in the Netherlands to keep growing thanks to large private equity appetite. The Dutch watchdog said Dutch companies were attractive takeover targets, partly because there are few governmental obstacles. Last year, investment funds spent more than $30 billion buying out Dutch businesses. In Saturday's newspaper interview, the Philips CEO added that he expected his company to spend several hundred millions to a few billion euros on acquisitions itself. When asked whether he would really say 'no' if asked to assume the post of CEO at German rival Siemens ( SIEGn.DE ), Kleisterlee -- whose contract was just extended to 2011 -- replied: "You can be sure of that."
