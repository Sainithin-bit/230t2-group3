 (Reuters) - Former News of the World editor Andy Coulson, News International CEO Rebekah Brooks, and Dow Jones CEO Les Hinton gave evidence to a British parliamentary committee between 2003 and 2009 about phone hacking and police payments. 

 News Corp deputy chief operating officer James Murdoch said on Thursday that the News of the World "made statements to parliament without being in the full possession of the facts." He said the paper and News International "wrongly maintained that these issues were confined to one reporter." Here are excerpts of what Coulson, Brooks and Hinton told parliament's Culture, Media and Sport select committee. ON PAYMENTS TO POLICE FOR INFORMATION (On Friday police arrested Coulson on suspicion of corruption and conspiring to intercept communications. He was later released on police bail to a date in October). "We have paid the police for information in the past," Rebekah Brooks (March 2003), newly appointed as editor of the News International daily tabloid the Sun, after editing the News of the World between 2000 and January 2003. In April 2011, as CEO of News International, she issued a statement saying she had not been referring to any specific instances in her 2003 testimony. "I was responding to a specific line of questioning on how newspapers get information. My intention was simply to comment generally on the widely held belief that payments had been made in the past to police officers. If, in doing so, I gave the impression that I had knowledge of any specific cases, I can assure you that this was not my intention," Brooks said. In July 2009 the committee's Adam Price asked Coulson about police payments. Price: "So as far as you were aware the News of the World, while you were editor or deputy editor, never paid a serving police officer for information? Coulson: "Not to my knowledge." Price: "No journalist on the News of the World?" Coulson: "No" ON PHONE HACKING AT THE NEWS OF THE WORLD (In Jan 2007 the paper's royal affairs editor Clive Goodman was jailed for four months, and private detective Glenn Mulcaire for six months, after admitting illegally intercepting the voicemails of palace officials) "I was, as you know, editor of the News of the World for four years from January 2003 until January 2007. During that time I never condoned the use of phone hacking and nor do I have any recollection of incidences where phone hacking took place," Andy Coulson (July 2009, when director of communications for then opposition leader David Cameron). Coulson said he had no involvement in phone hacking during his journalistic career. "There have been rumors about that kind of activity, I suppose, and media commentators have written about it. It has been in the ether of the newspaper world for some time but, no, I have never had any involvement in it at all." (July 2009) ON GOODMAN, ROGUE REPORTER "I can only speak for the newspaper that I edited for a period and I am absolutely sure that Clive (Goodman)'s case was a very unfortunate rogue case," Coulson (July 2009). "What we had with the Clive Goodman case was a reporter who deceived the managing editor's office and, in turn, deceived me. I have thought long and hard about this (I did when I left): what could I have done to have stopped this from happening? But if a rogue reporter decides to behave in that fashion I am not sure that there is an awful lot more I could have done," Coulson (July 2009). "There was never any evidence delivered to me that suggested that the conduct of Clive Goodman spread beyond him," Les Hinton (Sep. 2009). (Reporting by  Tim Castle  and  Matt Falloon )
