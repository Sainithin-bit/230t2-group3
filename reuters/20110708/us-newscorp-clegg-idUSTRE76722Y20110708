 PARIS  (Reuters) - British Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said on Friday the UK's media watchdog was "busted" and need to be replaced after newspapers had gained too much power to "make or break people's lives." 

 Speaking at a conference in Paris, Clegg said the phone-hacking scandal that prompted Rupert Murdoch to close Britain's biggest selling Sunday newspaper, the News of the World, was "the total collapse of yet another pillar of the British establishment." "Cleary the press complaints commission is busted .... (it's)toothless, it doesn't work and needs to be replaced," he told a conference organized by the French employer's association. "You can't have that much power given to people to make or break people's lives with no accountability," he said. (Reporting by  Leigh Thomas ; writing by  John Irish ; Editing by Jon Hemming)
