 LONDON  (Reuters) - The European Banking Authority said on Friday it will publish the results of its health check of 91 lenders on July 15 at 1600 GMT along with measures to bolster capital for those that failed and for those that nearly failed. 

 "The EBA expects the presentation of results to be accompanied by the announcement of relevant backstop measures for banks falling below the threshold and banks that may be deemed to have vulnerabilities or perceived by markets to be at risk," the EBA said in a statement. Banks will have to show they can maintain a core capital ratio of at least 5 percent to pass a test based on a mix of theoretical market shocks. The EBA said the results will include clear disclosure of credit and sovereign debt exposures, the impact of steps already taken by each bank by 30 April to bolster its capital base, and actions where necessary to improve capital cushions by the end of 2012. The results will be published in three phases: -- A summary will be published by the EBA at 1600 GMT; -- Publication by individual banks of their results, including credit and sovereign debt exposures using an EBA template, also at 1600 GMT.
