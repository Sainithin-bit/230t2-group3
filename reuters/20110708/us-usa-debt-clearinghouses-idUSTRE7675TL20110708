 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - U.S. derivatives clearinghouses, which guarantee contracts tied to everything from oil to Google shares, are making contingency plans should Congress fail to raise the federal debt cap by an August 2 deadline. 

 The clearinghouses accept a range of collateral to back trades, including Treasuries. If the United States hits its $14.3 trillion borrowing limit and runs out of money to pay its bills, those Treasuries could suddenly drop in value, putting clearinghouses on the hook for failed trades unless market participants pony up new collateral. Clearinghouses say they watch the value of the collateral they hold, and will make sure they are not caught short if markets take a sudden swing. Among measures under consideration are accepting Treasuries and other securities at a deeper-than-usual discount, and requiring more margins be posted in cash. "What it comes down to for us is, we look at value -- how do you come up with the value to back the positions?" said Jim Binder, a spokesman for the OCC, which guarantees all U.S. stock-options trades backed by about $85 billion in collateral. "If Treasuries are not worth as much, then you owe more. At a base level, it's pretty straightforward from our perspective." During the 2007-2009 financial crisis, U.S. clearinghouses weathered an unprecedented number of member firm failures and near-failures, and emerged without a single default. That record helped convince lawmakers to force much of the $600 trillion over-the-counter derivatives market into clearinghouses, making their ability to handle any new crisis even more critical to global financial stability. Democrats and Republicans will meet this weekend to discuss how to cut the national debt and pave the way for an agreement to raise the debt ceiling, but are not yet close to a deal, a top Republican said on Friday. CME Group Inc, whose clearinghouse typically handles $2.2 billion in margin payments daily, is among the largest clearers that would be affected by an impasse. "We will continue to monitor the liquidity environment and appropriate collateral haircuts as the U.S. approaches the debt ceiling," a spokesman said in an emailed statement. Investors by and large expect the White House and Congressional leaders to come to a deal and avert a crisis. Traders at Intrade.com, a Dublin-based market where bettors can put money on the probabilities of a wide range of current events, on Friday gave a debt ceiling deal an 80 percent chance of success. None of the clearinghouses interviewed by Reuters would discuss their plans in detail, saying the possibility is simply too remote. "Due to the highly speculative nature of such an event (a default by the U.S.), it is not appropriate for us to comment on this question," a spokesman at the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation said. DTCC clears Treasuries, derivatives and other securities. (Editing by  James Dalgleish )
