 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. employment growth ground to a halt in June, with employers hiring the fewest number of workers in nine months, dampening hopes the economy was on the cusp of regaining momentum after stumbling in recent months. 

 KEY POINTS: * Nonfarm payrolls rose only 18,000, the weakest reading since September, the Labor Department said on Friday, well below economists' expectations for a 90,000 rise. COMMENTS: MICHAEL STRAUSS, CHIEF ECONOMIST, COMMONFUND, WILTON, CONNECTICUT "It is disappointing. We may have built too much expectations into it. If you would have asked a month ago when do we start to see these supply channel disruptions alleviated in the labor market, most people would have said July and not June. The market got a little bit hyped up hoping that the turn in the labor market would have been June. But it's not going to be until July. "When I look at some of the subcomponents in the report the biggest thing that we think is changing going forward is the manufacturing sector, which has been flat 13 straight months. "There's going to be a market reaction today in the equity market. There's going to be a market reaction in general. I think the bigger issue is we're going to have to wait another month and it should have really been a July/August event. If conditions are going to get better, the hint that you would probably need to see is a reduction in initial unemployment claims and we are likely to see that in late July or early August." MOHAMED EL-ERIAN, CO-CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER AT PACIFIC INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT CO., NEWPORT BEACH, CALIF.: "Every aspect of this disappointing report points to the U.S. facing an unemployment crisis." DAVID SEMMENS, U.S. ECONOMIST, STANDARD CHARTERED, NEW YORK: "It's a terrible number, there is no good news you can glean from it. It's driven unemployment up and the participation rate has gone down. It shows the labor market is still lagging improvements in the overall economy. I don't think this puts pressure on the Fed to do more, though. It's a concern, but you there's still some job creation and you're really seeing softness in the economy rather than an outright contraction. I think this shows that the outlook for business remains uncertain, but the pickup in ISM suggests things are improving. I don't think it will affect the deficit reduction debate either. Any spending cuts will be aimed at 2013." TOM PORCELLI, CHIEF ECONOMIST, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS, NEW YORK: "Overall there was nothing good about this report and weakness is abound. What stood out to me is that weekly earnings continue to drop on a year-over-year basis, the diffusion index is close to break-even, and temporary employment continue to shed workers. All of this paints a negative picture. This confirms our view that the Fed will continue to keep rates on hold into 2012 and if weak employment continues it will be pushed out even further." TERRY SHEEHAN, ECONOMIC ANALYST, STONE & MCCARTHY, PRINCETON, NEW JERSEY "These are very disappointing numbers and indicative of lower job growth that is just disappointing to see. This puts Fed policy on hold; it does not increase the chances of a third round of large-scale asset purchases, simply because we don't face the risk of deflation we did last summer." SCOTT BROWN, CHIEF ECONOMIST, RAYMOND JAMES, ST. PETERSBURG, FL.: "It was definitely weaker than anticipated following the ADP numbers. Some anecdotal evidence suggests things weren't as bad in June. The market may lag a bit, but certainly we will see a soft patch. "We'll see the markets digesting the news. The theme has been that the markets are downplaying the bad data and embracing the good news. "Particularly for the stock market it tends to be all or nothing. Either the economy is booming or it's slowing. We hope that we will see a second half rebound." CHRIS RUPKEY, CHIEF FINANCIAL ECONOMIST, BANK OF TOKYO-MITSUBISHI UFJ, NEW YORK: "It means the soft patch is persisting. I guess we jumped the gun and relied too much on ADP. They made it one month and then this month the miss was spectacular on the part of ADP. The profession generally talked themselves into believing the May weakness in private payroll jobs was related to the rainy weather on the east and the west coast and the supply disruptions from the Japan quake. That was not true. The economy remains in a soft patch." PIERRE ELLIS, SENIOR ECONOMIST, DECISION ECONOMICS, NEW YORK: "The message on the economy is ongoing stagnation. Income growth is marginal so there's no indication of momentum. To the degree that this shifts the long-term outlook for the economy, that's going to hurt budget negotiations. Republicans have to be careful about being painted as the bad guys. It's hard to cut government spending when the economy looks as flat as it does. It also weakens the President politically. "On prospects for another phase of quantitative easing, the Fed has already told us that the bar is high for that. The cost-benefit ratio has become very unfavorable in their mind." MICHAEL MARRALE, MANAGING DIRECTOR AND HEAD OF SALES TRADING, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS, NEW YORK: "Very disappointing following the ADP number obviously and especially in light of the fact there was some short covering ahead of this number with some obvious fear on behalf of the shorts the number would be much better-than-expected. The whisper number kept creeping up over the course of the night and we were hearing from our European desk that the expectation had crept over 150,000. So very disappointing and more from a positioning standpoint where some shorts had thrown in the towel over the last several days and especially yesterday. I would expect them to re-engage on the back of this number. We've just about given back yesterday's rally. This will really give the shorts some teeth in terms of re-engaging." SHAUN OSBORNE, SENIOR CURRENCY STRATEGIST, TD SECURITIES, TORONTO: "The number stinks. There were a couple of head fakes with ADP and the news that (President) Obama was going to make a statement, which led people to believe we would get a stronger number. But the dollar is rallying, so I think the key here is that this is a risk-off sort of reaction. We had equity markets already weak in Europe. We've seen support for euro/dollar around 1.42. Technically it should go lower, and I think it will. A lot will depend on how equities trade throughout the day." VIMOMBI NSHOM, ECONOMIST, IFR ECONOMICS, A UNIT OF THOMSON REUTERS "The reluctance of private-sector employers to create jobs in June, in conjunction with the continued downward trend relating to government employment, essentially created a flat jobs market last month, with only 18,000 additional jobs created in the non-farm sector. This sharply contrasts with an earlier estimate of employment (ADP nonfarm up 157k) as well as recently updated forecasts (market 90k) seeking a figure that would confirm a rebound from May's originally weak report of 54k jobs created. The only confirmation this report gives, is the affirmation that the economy's recovery is far from steadily improving -- especially when considering that the employment rate rose (for the third month) to 9.2% (with droves leaving the labor force 449k). "June's payroll is not the result of cut-throat downsizing (only three private sectors contracted), but is more so a situation of stalled hiring. The private sector added 57k jobs to the market, led by a 53k gain in services. Goods producing jobs inched up 4k and were held back by a 9k drop in construction. As expected, financial services lost 15k jobs (after May's gain of 14k). "Unexpected, and even more so unwelcome, temp jobs fell by 12K after May's fall of 1.7k. Given that temp jobs lead permanent hiring, this recent string of declines does not give the indication of employers construing plans to hire. Government jobs were reduced by 39k, which is similar to the 48k in May." JOHN CANALLY, ECONOMIST AND INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, LPL FINANCIAL, BOSTON "You don't want to read too much into one report. The economy has been through this soft spot and apparently people thought it was over yesterday with the ADP but it wasn't over in June. So you have to wait until July when you get a big rebound in auto production. "I think you probably go back and retest the low end of the recent range in Treasuries. Next week you have inflation data, but you also have manufacturing data--you're going to find out next week if we're getting the rebound in July everyone thought would happen. "People were bracing for a strong number, got a weak one, and that's usually bad news for stocks and good news for Treasuries."
