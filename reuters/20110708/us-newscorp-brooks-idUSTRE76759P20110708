 LONDON  (Reuters) - Rebekah Brooks, confidante of Rupert Murdoch and trailblazing tabloid editor, clung on as chief executive of News Corp's UK newspaper arm this week even as the title she used to edit was shut down for a scandal on her watch. 

 Her ability to survive while the News of the World's 200 staff were fired is testament to her charm, ruthlessness, and consummate networking skills, those who know her say. "She has bags of charm. I think that's what makes her a brilliant networker. And she's good company. I suspect she's had to really harden up to do the job she does now," said one forgiving employee, a day after finding out he had lost his job. Politicians, rivals and ordinary Britons joined in uproar this week when it was revealed that the News of the World, Britain's best-selling Sunday tabloid, had hacked the voicemail messages of murder victims and bereaved relatives of soldiers. In an astonishing response to the rapidly spreading scandal, Murdoch's son James announced that the 168-year-old News of the World would fold after this Sunday's edition. "They're closing down a whole newspaper just to protect one woman's job," said one of the 200 reporters unceremoniously sacked on Thursday, who described an atmosphere of "seething anger" and "pure hatred" directed at Brooks. The flame-haired 43-year-old Brooks has had a remarkable rise to power in the male-dominated world of UK tabloid journalism, becoming editor of the News of the World in 2000 and the Sun's first female editor in 2003. In 2009, Brooks was promoted to become chief executive of News International, reporting to Rupert Murdoch's son James. She has become a favorite of Rupert Murdoch's, moving the Australian-born magnate to issue a rare statement of personal support as she came under increasing fire on Wednesday. She is also a friend and neighbor of Prime Minister David Cameron. "She's sinuous and clever and probably the most brilliant networker I've ever met," said veteran media commentator Roy Greenslade, a former News International journalist who has known Brooks for many years. Former employees describe her as "one of the lads" who fitted into the macho culture of the tabloids by swearing in the newsroom and drinking in the pub with colleagues -- while making it very clear who was boss. "At first, wondered who this person flouncing around the office with big red hair like she owned the place was. I soon found out," said one ex-Sun reporter. OLD WARHORSES Brooks, known as Rebekah Wade until her second marriage to ex-racehorse trainer and author Charlie Brooks two years ago, has spent almost her entire career at News International. After a grammar-school education in the northwestern English county of Cheshire and a short spell in Paris, she joined the News of the World at the age of 20 as a feature writer and rose to become deputy editor. In 1998 she transferred to sister tabloid The Sun, a daily, spending two years as deputy editor there before returning as editor to the News of the World, where she ran a controversial campaign to name and shame child sex offenders. It was under her editorship that an investigator working for the News of the World hacked into the voicemail of missing schoolgirl Milly Dowler, later found murdered. Brooks says she did not know about the hacking. One ex-employee from that time describes her as a hands-on editor who led from the front and mucked in with news editors as the weekly publication deadline approached. Despite a sometimes tough demeanor that could intimidate hardened hacks, she was generally charming and wrapped the paper's male editors around her little finger, current and former colleagues say. "She buttered up a lot of middle-aged men, and she's good at that. They probably each thought they were a special adviser and confidant. She was very good at keeping those old warhorses well and truly on her side," said one ex-employee. PERSONAL LIFE In 2003, Brooks returned to the Sun, succeeding her former boss David Yelland as editor of Britain's best-selling newspaper, which currently has almost 3 million daily readers and at the time had many more. During her tenure, the newspaper's former hard news focus shifted toward more celebrity stories. The topless girls who appear daily on page 3 of the tabloid remained, despite reports that she had earlier campaigned against them as deputy editor. It was during this period that Brooks separated from her first husband Ross Kemp, best known for his role as hard man Grant Mitchell in the popular BBC soap opera EastEnders. It was gleefully reported by rival newspapers that she had been arrested following an alleged assault on her husband -- while the Sun was running a campaign against domestic violence. She was later released and no further action was taken. "She wouldn't bring her personal life into the office," says a former News of the World reporter. "She wouldn't come in and say: 'Ross and I have had a terrible row,' like some women might. She was more likely to come in and say: 'Where the hell is that page you promised me?'"
