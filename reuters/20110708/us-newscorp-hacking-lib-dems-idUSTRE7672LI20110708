 LONDON  (Reuters) - The deputy leader of Britain's Liberal Democrat coalition party has challenged the fitness of BSkyB and News Corp to hold a broadcast license after allegations of phone hacking at a newspaper owned by News Corp. 

 Simon Hughes said the idea was his own but that he had the support of party leader Nick Clegg, the deputy prime minister. "There has been an admission that both companies were aware at the highest level of activities that were illegal and improper. It seems to me that crosses the line between being a fit and proper person, or fit and proper organization, to hold a broadcasting license," Hughes told BBC Radio 4. "The duty of the regulator is to make sure that those who are given such licenses or keep them are appropriate for the job." (Reporting by  Keith Weir )
