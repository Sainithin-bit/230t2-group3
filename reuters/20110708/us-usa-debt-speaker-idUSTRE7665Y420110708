 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Speaker of the House of Representatives John Boehner told his Republican members on Thursday that chances of reaching a budget deal within the next few days "was maybe 50-50," a party aide said. 

 "Whether or not it happens is really dependent on whether they (Democrats) continue to insist on tax hikes" over Republican objections, the aide said. Boehner offered his assessment at a closed-door meeting with members shortly before White House talks with President Barack Obama and other congressional leaders.
