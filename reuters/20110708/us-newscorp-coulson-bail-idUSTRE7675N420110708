 LONDON  (Reuters) - British Prime Minister David Cameron's former communications chief Andy Coulson was bailed until October Friday, police said, after being arrested over allegations of phone hacking while he was editor of the News of the World newspaper. 

 "A man aged 43 who was arrested by appointment at a south London police station today has been bailed to a date in October," a metropolitan police spokesman said, in response to a question about Coulson. Coulson, who edited the weekly News of the World from 2003 to 2007, was arrested on suspicion of conspiring to intercept communications and suspicion of corruption.
