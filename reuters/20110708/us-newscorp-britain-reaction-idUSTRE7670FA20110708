 LONDON  (Reuters) - Following are headlines and reaction from British newspapers to Thursday's announcement by Rupert Murdoch's News International that it will close the News of the World tabloid. 

 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH GOODBYE, CRUEL WORLD "The paper's demise certainly marks the end of a particular tabloid era and culture. But it may only have succeeded in triggering an earthquake that now threatens the entire British press," wrote London editor Andrew Gilligan. THE TIMES HACKED TO DEATH "After a colorful, prize-winning career the News of the World lost its bearings and the faith of its readers. "A terrible lapse in professional behavior -- a lapse by people who had forgotten what professional behavior was -- has now laid this great paper low." THE GUARDIAN SCANDAL THAT CLOSED THE NEWS OF THE WORLD "That Rupert Murdoch is ruthless is a universally acknowledged truth. But his action in killing off the 168-year-old News of the World ... was one of the most clinical moves in his long, tumultuous career as a newspaper publisher." DAILY MIRROR HACKED TO DEATH "The News of the World phone-hacking scandal claimed its latest victim - the paper itself." DAILY MAIL PAPER THAT DIED OF SHAME "As 250 lose their jobs on the News of the World, the woman who led it to disaster remains defiant and in place." THE FINANCIAL TIMES "SCREWS" BOWS OUT WITH LAST SHOCK STORY "Suddenly, after 168 years of walking the fine line between half-truth and lies, the paper has fallen flat on its face and opted not to get up. I am not sure even the News of the World has reported anything quite so utterly unexpected," wrote columnist Matthew Engel. THE SUN WORLD'S END "The end after a proud history."
