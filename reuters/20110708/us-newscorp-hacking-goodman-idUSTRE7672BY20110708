 LONDON  (Reuters) - The former News of the World royal editor, jailed in 2007, was arrested over alleged payments to police, a police source said on Friday. 

 Clive Goodman was jailed for four months in January 2007 after royal staff members complained about voicemail messages having been intercepted relating to Prince William's knee injury. The latest arrest was in connection with a police operation looking at alleged payments to police by journalists at the News of the World, part of Rupert Murdoch's News Corp.
