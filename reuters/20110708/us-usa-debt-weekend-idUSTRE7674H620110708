 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - White House spokesman Jay Carney on Friday characterized this weekend's debt and deficit talks as "vital" to the prospect of getting an agreement. 

 "I don't think we have any time to waste. August 2 looms large. The fact of that deadline is immutable," Carney told reporters in a briefing. President Barack Obama will host congressional leaders for a meeting on Sunday and staff from both sides were expected to meet through the weekend.
