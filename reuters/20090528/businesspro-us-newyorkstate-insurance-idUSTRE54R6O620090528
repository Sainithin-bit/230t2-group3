 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - New York state Insurance Superintendent Eric Dinallo will resign effective July 3, 2009, Governor David Paterson said on Thursday, amid speculation the former prosecutor may run for state attorney general. 

 Dinallo, who was a top aide to former Democratic Governor Eliot Spitzer when he was state attorney general, will become a visiting finance professor at New York University's Stern School of Business, Paterson said in a statement. New York's insurance chiefs are the most prominent state insurance regulators in the nation due to New York's position as a financial capital. An insurance department spokesman said Dinallo was not immediately available to comment on his plans. The current state attorney general, Andrew Cuomo, also a Democrat, would beat Governor David Paterson in an election, according to recent polls. But Cuomo has not said he plans to run for governor, an office his father, Mario, held from 1983 to 1994. Paterson saluted Dinallo for overseeing the state's response to the global credit crisis and the near-capsizing of bond insurers and insurance giant American International Group ( AIG.N ). "Under Superintendent Dinallo's leadership, the Department effectuated the largest regulatory settlement in the U.S., played an integral part in the reform of the workers' compensation system and facilitated more than $15 billion in new capital for the bond insurance industry," Paterson said. Dinallo, in a statement released with the governor's, said: "Our efforts aimed at financial fairness and economic protection for policy-holders of all kinds, from new homeowners to the largest employers, are vitally important for New York's future."
