 (Reuters) - General Motors Corp and the U.S. Treasury made an improved equity exchange offer on Thursday to bondholders with $27 billion in debt, intended to pave the way for a quick bankruptcy process for the automaker. 

 Under the proposed deal, which GM said was supported by creditors representing about 20 percent of its debt, bondholders would be offered 10 percent of a reorganized company and given warrants to purchase another 15 percent. In exchange for the improved payout, bondholders would agree not to oppose a move to sell GM's profitable assets to a new company funded by the U.S. government in a fast-track bankruptcy process. The exchange offer will be open to bondholders until 5 p.m. EDT Saturday, GM said. Following are details of the '363 sale' bankruptcy process for GM proposed by the U.S. Treasury and its new equity exchange offer for bondholders: FILING * GM to file under Chapter 11 and pursue a sale under Section 363(b) of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and the automaker would be split into two companies: Old GM and New GM. * GM and its debtor subsidiaries would sell most of their assets to New GM. The rest of the assets would be held in Old GM, which will remain in bankruptcy. * Following the sale under section 363, the U.S. Treasury estimates that about $27.2 billion principal amount of notes would ultimately comprise substantially all of Old GM's debt. * Obama administration official estimates that any GM bankruptcy would take at least 60 to 90 days. NEW GM CAPITALIZATION * Debt: New GM is estimated to have about $17 billion in total consolidated debt, excluding debt related to GM's automotive supplier financing program and warranty program. Debt includes $8 billion owed to U.S. Treasury, $2.5 billion of debt owed to the United Auto Workers union-aligned healthcare trust -- Voluntary Employee Beneficiary Association (VEBA) -- and $6.5 billion of other debt. * Perpetual preferred stock: $9 billion cumulative perpetual preferred stock with a 9 percent dividend per annum. Of that, $2.5 billion issued to the U.S. Treasury, $6.5 billion issued to New VEBA. OWNERSHIP * The outstanding common equity of New GM would be allocated as follows after consummation of the 363 Sale: -- 72.5 percent to the U.S. Treasury -- 17.5 percent to New VEBA -- 10 percent to Old GM WARRANTS * Old GM to receive warrants to acquire newly issued shares of New GM equal to 7.5 percent of New GM common equity. This is exercisable at any time prior to the seventh anniversary of issuance. * New VEBA to receive warrants to acquire newly issued shares of New GM equal to 2.5 percent of New GM common equity. This is exercisable at any time prior to December 31, 2015. DIP FINANCING * The U.S. Treasury, together with one or more non-U.S. governmental entities, will offer debtor-in-possession financing. * Other than the $8 billion of debt owed to the U.S. Treasury by New GM, all amounts owed to the U.S. Treasury under existing debt and debtor-in-possession financing in connection with the 363 Sale would be equitized. * The U.S. Treasury has provided $19.4 billion of loans to GM to keep it afloat since the start of the year. UNION: *The United Auto Workers will have one director on board of New GM * Union does not expect to exercise warrant for 2.5 percent stake in New GM * Union estimates New GM would have to be valued at $75 billion for union warrants to be exercisable. NEW AID GM to receive total of $40 billion in new aid, including $9 billion from Canada government. (Reporting by  Soyoung Kim  and  Poornima Gupta ; Editing by  Tim Dobbyn  and  Matthew Lewis )
