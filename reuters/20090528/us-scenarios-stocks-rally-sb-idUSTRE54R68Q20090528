 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Despite the protests of bearish investors, the equity market has stubbornly resisted a significant correction after the 37-percent rally in the S&P 500  .SPX  between March 9 and May 8. 

 The S&P 500 has declined by 3.5 percent since May 8, but several selloffs have been unable to gather momentum. Still, investors believe that a correction is likely at some point because of significant risks to the economy and the financial sector. Below are some scenarios that may cause investors to rethink the recent run-up. RISING INTEREST RATES The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note has been rising steadily since the beginning of the year as investors worry about the ever-expanding amount of debt needed to fund a record $1.75 trillion budget deficit. Yields on the note have climbed from about 2 percent from the start of the year to 3.7 percent at the end of May. The concern is that higher rates will inhibit borrowing by businesses and consumers, slowing the pace of recovery. "We've seen the 10-year and 30-year bond shoot up a lot and that's going to affect mortgage rates pretty soon," said Paul Nolte, director of investments at Hinsdale Associates in Hinsdale, Illinois. "What the government's doing is essentially crowding out private business' ability to get loans." Furthermore, rising interest rates cause investors to reconsider stocks as an investment. When rates are low, investors believe the added risk of stocks is worth taking, given the general outperformance of stocks over time. With the 10-year note's yield at 3.7 percent and rising, bonds are looking more attractive. Stocks are back at levels seen in mid-January, but "at that time, the bond market offered very little in the way of any serious competition as the 10-year T-note yield was sitting at 2.3%," wrote David Rosenberg, chief economist and strategist at Gluskin Sheff & Associates in Toronto. HOPED-FOR ECONOMIC RECOVERY FALTERS The stock market has rallied in part on the belief that the economy is reaching a bottom. Numerous reports released since early March show signs of stabilization. But retail spending and housing prices remain sluggish, and the current picture appears to be one of an economy that is declining more slowly, not growing. "Housing is still an issue," said Nolte. "What people are looking at or had been expecting is that housing was going to turn around quickly." Federal Reserve officials recently lowered their core gross domestic product projections for the United States in 2009 to minus 1.3 percent to minus 2.0 percent. While investors believe the economy will recover, the stock market has a way of overindulging in optimism. INFLATION Concerns are that the Obama administration's $787 billion dollar stimulus plan, along with the Federal Reserve's efforts to restore the banking sector to health through a zero -interest-rate policy, will cause inflation to rise. The U.S. headline inflation figure was flat in April, but the rise in commodity prices suggests a return of demand, thanks to the easy monetary policies of global central banks. Oil prices recently crossed $65 a barrel, and analysts believe $80 is in sight. The Baltic Exchange's main sea freight index, which tracks rates to ship dry commodities, has been climbing steadily since mid-April and is at its highest level in almost eight months. The index is seen as a key measures of demand for certain commodities and can portend rising inflation. "Inflation may be the thing that kills the market, and I do think we'll see inflation," said Robert Stimpson, portfolio manager at Oak associates in Akron, Ohio. MORE PROBLEMS AT THE BANKS Despite a series of initiatives to return the U.S. financial sector to health, many investors complain that visibility remains poor. Although many banks reported better-than-expected earnings in the first quarter, analysts point to the $700 billion in government TARP bailout funds directed at the sector and the relaxation of mark-to-market rules that allowed the banks to avoid writing down losses on certain assets. The KBW Bank Index .BKX is up 90 percent since early March, when Citigroup shares fell below $1 amid fears the government would nationalize some major banks. "I think they will be taking more write-downs, particularly with respect to commercial property," said William Rutherford, president of Rutherford Investment Management in Portland, Oregon. "There has been some news out lately that middle and higher income people are now having trouble making their mortgage payments, so there's going to be some problems there, too, in areas that were unexpected."
