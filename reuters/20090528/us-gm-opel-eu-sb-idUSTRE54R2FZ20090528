 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - The European Commission called a meeting of European trade and economy ministers for Friday to discuss the future of carmaker Opel in Europe, insisting any solution must comply with EU state aid rules. 

 Overnight talks in Berlin between German authorities and officials from Opel's parent, General Motors, failed to produce a deal on state funding to keep Opel afloat if GM files for bankruptcy. Governments of European member states that have Opel plants are following the talks closely because they want to save jobs. "I think it is very important to underline that the solution is a solution for all the EU member states and that it's not only Germany," Flemish Premier Kris Peeters told Reuters of his concerns for some 2,600 Belgian jobs at Opel's Antwerp plant. GM has plants in Belgium, Poland and Spain for Opel, Vauxhall in Britain and Saab in Sweden. The EU meeting is scheduled to take place in Brussels at 3.00 p.m.. Industry ministers from all of the bloc's 27 member states have been invited, a spokesman for EU Industry Commissioner Guenter Verheugen said on Thursday. Spokesman Ton Van Lierop said officials from General Motors had not been invited to talks aimed "to continue the exchange of information and to provide for coordination" between EU states. "Of course, the Commission will also recall the need to respect EU rules," he told a regular news briefing. The EU executive has appealed to national governments to avoid moves that would ensure the survival of Opel factories on their soil at the cost of others elsewhere. EU Competition spokesman Jonathan Todd said the Commission was in contact with the various governments to ensure that state aid rules were respected. "At this stage we have no reason to believe that either the UK or German authorities will give state aid that would be in breach of EU rules," Todd said at the news conference. The EU fears the jostling over Opel, for which the leading bidders are Fiat and Magna, could tempt member states to try and circumvent its single-market rules. A 6 billion euro ($8.4 billion) French scheme to aid its carmakers provoked criticism from other countries in the bloc that the aid came with unwritten pledges not to close plants in France, and was only approved by the EU in February after Paris gave guarantees that the loan arrangements contained no protectionist elements.
