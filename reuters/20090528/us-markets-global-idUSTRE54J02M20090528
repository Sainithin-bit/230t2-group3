 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Oil prices jumped to almost $65 a barrel on Thursday, lifted by bullish U.S. inventory data, while U.S. Treasury bonds recovered some ground a day after worries about a record $1.75 trillion budget deficit sparked a sell-off. 

 The euro rose against the U.S. dollar and the yen fell broadly as better-than-expected U.S. manufacturing data and a slide in jobless claims lured investors in the Japanese currency into overseas assets. European shares fell and many U.S. stocks trended lower after April new home sales data and a downward revision to March's sales pointed to more weakness in the slumping U.S. housing market. Bank-to-bank three-month dollar borrowing costs fell, but money markets remained strained and fears about counterparty risk were not far beneath the surface. U.S. crude stocks fell more than expected last week as refiners ramped up operations, while gasoline inventories dropped for the fifth week, the Energy Information Administration said in weekly data released on Thursday. Commercial crude inventories fell 5.4 million barrels in the week ended May 22, the EIA said, dwarfing the 700,000-barrel decline analysts had forecast in a Reuters poll. "What we are seeing here is the demand side start to improve," said analyst Phil Flynn at Alaron Trading in Chicago. "Gasoline demand over the Memorial Day weekend is a critical point in judging the health of the U.S. economy. I don't think the increased demand over the holiday was a fluke." U.S. light sweet crude oil rose $1.18 to $64.63 a barrel, after touching a session high of $64.99. U.S. government debt prices recovered, with benchmark 10-year Treasuries rising a full point and 30-year long bonds gaining more than two points early in the session. The 10-year U.S. Treasury note was up 8/32 in price to yield 3.71 percent. The 2-year U.S. Treasury note fell 1/32 in price to yield 0.99 percent. Analysts questioned whether Wednesday's sell-off reflected market fundamentals, particularly since much of it came on mortgage-related trades. "The move has been so extreme," said James De Masi, chief fixed income strategist at Stifel Nicolaus & Co. Inc in Baltimore. "The move became exaggerated yesterday due to mortgage-related selling, on top of worries about supply and its inflation implication." Euro zone government bonds retreated in the aftermath of the sharp slide in U.S. Treasuries. "The talk was that it was mortgage hedging activity that really drove the sell-off late last night in Treasuries and that's a very specific factor to that market," said Sean Maloney, interest rate strategist at Nomura in London. Rising oil prices boosted energy shares, overshadowing mixed U.S. economic data. Exxon Mobil Corp ( XOM.N ) was one of the top boosts to the blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average, rising 0.89 percent. At 1 p.m., the Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  was down 0.16 points, or 0.00 percent, at 8,299.86. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  was up 3.23 points, or 0.36 percent, at 896.29. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  was down 2.23 points, or 0.13 percent, at 1,728.85. Shares of General Motors Corp ( GM.N ) rose after it said major bondholders had agreed to a debt-for-equity exchange, helping to counter uncertainty of the spillover effects onto the broader economy of a contentious bankruptcy filing. European shares fell in volatile trading on Thursday, led by financials such as Dutch ING Group ( ING.AS ) and Germany's Deutsche Bank ( DBKGn.DE ). The FTSEurofirst 300  .FTEU3  index of top European shares closed 1.2 percent lower at 860.21 points. The dollar fell against a basket of major currencies, with the U.S. Dollar Index .DXY down 0.26 percent at 80.55. Against the yen, the dollar was up 1.56 percent at 96.79. The euro was up 0.72 percent at $1.3933. The MSCI index of Asian stocks outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS had shed 0.3 percent. Japan's Nikkei average  .N225  closed 0.1 percent higher, supported by hopes that the Japanese economy may have seen its worst phase and is headed for a recovery.
