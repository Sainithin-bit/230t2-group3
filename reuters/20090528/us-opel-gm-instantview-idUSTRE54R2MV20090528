 PARIS  (Reuters) - As the battle for German carmaker Opel effectively narrowed to a race between Fiat and Magna, overnight talks to shield Opel from parent General Motors Corp's looming bankruptcy ended with no deal. 

 Magna Chairman Frank Stronach said on Thursday the car parts maker had boosted the capital amount in its offer, and would hold further meetings with GM. Fiat Chief Executive Sergio Marchionne, meanwhile, was on his way to the United States for talks about Fiat's partnership with Chrysler LLC. Below are comments from analysts on the Opel talks' outcome. MICHAEL RAAB, KEPLER CAPITAL MARKETS "The solution looked like a very good one for Opel and parties interested in it, if the problem with the bridge financing had not arisen. The fact that it is being transferred debt-free and in possession of its intellectual properties enhances chances of getting government guarantees/money in order to be able to weather the short-term. "From today's point of view this made it likely that Opel will be temporarily parked at a custodian, as suggested by the German government. But we think that a bridge financing would be imperative for this concept. We think the solution would be a good one for Opel and make it even more attractive to bidders Fiat and Magna. But the additional claims of the U.S. side of negotiations represent a set-back." MARK PRIEST, TRADER AT ETX CAPITAL IN LONDON "The overnight news that the German government cannot broker a deal for the European arm of GM, Opel, will send jitters round the markets. Opel may have lost money nine years out of the last 10, but the expectation was that the healthy sweeteners on offer from Ms Merkel would have been enough." MICHAEL SEIFERT, D&B GERMANY "Size alone does not protect anyone from downfall, not even GM. The world's biggest car company maneuvered itself into this seemingly hopeless situation, at the end of which all signs are pointing to an impending insolvency. "While the Americans are calmly expectant of bankruptcy, the Opel case has been given top priority in Germany by the Chancellor. But it remains open whether this commitment will prove to be worth it and what the intentions of a possible investor at Opel are." INDUSTRY ANALYSTS IN MILAN "Fiat's offer is a 100 times better (than Magna's)," one of them said, adding that politics were getting in the way and making the result of negotiations unpredictable. If the deal did not pan out, Fiat would have to look at Saab, Volvo or some other carmaker in Asia, he said. He said he did not expect Marchionne to try to get Opel at any cost. Another analyst said Fiat would be forced to find another partner if it failed to buy Opel, and cited BMW or PSA Peugeot Citroen as potential partners. PSA has already said it wants to remain on its own, and if Fiat were to try for a deal with PSA it would face having to pay out money it does not have, in addition to family politics, French politics and union opposition to possible cost cuts, the analyst said. Fiat managed to avoid paying for Chrysler, and its offer for Opel also envisions a similar arrangement. Its share price could suffer if Fiat does not seal a deal soon, the analyst added.
