 BERLIN  (Reuters) - Talks on shielding Opel from a looming bankruptcy of its U.S. parent General Motors ended on Thursday without a result, German ministers said. 

 German Economy Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg told reporters after over 12 hours of talks in Berlin that the German government needed answers from GM and the U.S. administration by Friday and held out hope a deal could be reached then. Finance Minister Peer Steinbrueck said Opel bidder RHJ International was no longer in the running for the carmaker, leaving Fiat and Magna. (Writing by  Noah Barkin )
