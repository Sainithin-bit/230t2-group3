 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - An ad hoc committee of major General Motors Corp bondholders gave its support for a revised bond exchange, the group said on Thursday. 

 "The Ad Hoc Committee of GM bondholders supports the revised offer from GM and believes that when contrasted with the alternative -- uncertain and costly bankruptcy court litigation -- that it represents the best alternative for bondholders in the current difficult and dire situation," the committee said in a statement.
