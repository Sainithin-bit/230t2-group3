 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - New orders for long-lasting U.S. manufactured goods rose more than expected in April, posting their biggest gain in 16 months, according to government data on Thursday that suggested the recession was winding down. 

 The number of U.S. workers filing new claims for jobless pay dropped by 13,000 last week, the Labor Department reported on Thursday, but so-called continued claims hit a new record as the recession took a further toll on job prospects. KEY POINTS: DURABLE GOODS: * April's 1.9 percent increase was the biggest percentage advance since December 2007, when orders rose 4.1 percent, the Commerce Department said. Analysts polled by Reuters expected a rise of 0.4 percent in April, and orders excluding transportation to ease 0.3 percent. * March orders were revised sharply lower, falling 2.1 percent from the previously reported 0.8 percent decline. * New orders excluding transportation climbed 0.8 percent in April after declining 2.7 percent in March, boosted by orders for communications equipment, machinery and fabricated metal products. * Civilian aircraft and parts tumbled 6.8 percent after surging 7.5 percent in March. Non-defense capital goods orders excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending, fell 1.5 percent in April. The prior month was revised to show a 1.4 percent decline, previously reported as a 0.4 percent gain. JOBLESS CLAIMS: * Initial claims for state unemployment insurance benefits declined to a seasonally adjusted 623,000 in the week ended May 23 from a revised 636,000 in the prior week. It was the second straight week in which initial claims fell. COMMENTS: KEN MAYLAND, PRESIDENT, CLEARVIEW ECONOMICS LLC, PEPPER PIKE, OHIO: DURABLE GOODS: "Maybe the patient has a pulse -- both the increase and it came in better than expected in April. March was a terrible month but we may be ready for a transition to a better position. "The rate of decline of inventories in April was half of that in March. We had been living on inventories and now someone has to put in orders and get production moving again. "One area that really stinks is capital spending with utilization rate being so low, in addition to weak profits and tight lending. Companies are disinclined to put equipment on the factory order. That will remain chronically weak for a while." JOBLESS CLAIMS: "Things are getting less bad, but you are still adding to the pool of the unemployed. "Historically when you see these numbers come off their peak, recovery typically follows within two months. The caveat is that we have to absorb a lot of unemployed auto workers over the next several months." JAY MUELLER, SENIOR PORTFOLIO MANAGER, WELLS CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, MILWAUKEE, WISCONSIN: "The durables numbers are interesting. The headline numbers came in better than expected. The revisions took it all away and then some. The fact that we printed a better-than-expected number I think means nothing at this point. This data is very volatile. "As far as the claims number, continuing claims just keep going up and there is a straight line higher in the insured unemployment rate. I think what this means is that in the May non-farm payrolls report we will see the unemployment rate going up to 9.2 percent or 9.3 percent." KURT KARL, CHIEF U.S. ECONOMIST, SWISS RE, NEW YORK: "The weekly unemployment claims figure is unambiguously good. It's creeping down. Continued claims is not good news but you need to stop the new ones coming in first. "Durable orders are kind of mixed. The topline is good, and capital goods excluding aircraft are not good. "The economy is hitting a low point and not deteriorating any further. We are not hard to see growth in the third quarter, but we should see growth by the fourth quarter." JAMES MASI, CHIEF FIXED INCOME STRATEGIST, STIFEL NICOLAUS & CO. INC., BALTIMORE: "The bigger news in durable goods is the huge downward revision to March. That more than offset the gain in April. It still shows extreme weakness on a three-month annualized basis. "Initial jobless claims fell, but continued claims hit a record high. "The data is consistent with the view that the rate of contraction is slowing, but we are still working our way through a recession. We haven't hit a bottom yet." DAN GREENHAUS, ANALYST, MILLER TABAK & CO, NEW YORK: "The claims held below recent levels. This is further evidence that the decline in the labor market seems to be leveling off. That said, continuing claims remain at record levels. This is a trend that is holding steady, and shows a lack of hiring in the labor market. "The durable goods data is an historically volatile number, so it's not surprising that the revision to last month was so substantial. Historically, this number is in line. "I think both numbers will matter for the market today, seeing as how we're past earnings season. Macroeconomic data will certainly be focused on right now." MARKET REACTION: STOCKS: U.S. stock indexes reduced gains, and then rebounded. BONDS: U.S. Treasury debt prices briefly pared gains. DOLLAR: U.S. dollar was flat.
