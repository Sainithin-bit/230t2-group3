 ATHENS  (Reuters) - Greek banks were down 6.1 percent in late afternoon trade on Tuesday, with analysts citing concerns over a lack of details on the participation of the private sector in an EU deal to rescue Greece. 

 "After the positive reaction following the deal last week, the market realizes that there are a lot of uncertainties about PSI (private sector participation), how the exchange will be done and how it will impact banks' results," said Natasha Roumantzi, head of Piraeus Securities' analyst department. Several other analysts also cited profit taking after the Greek banking index jumped 25 percent last week. (Reporting by Lefteris Papadimas; Writing by  Ingrid Melander )
