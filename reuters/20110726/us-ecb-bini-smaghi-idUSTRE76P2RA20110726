 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Euro zone economic recovery continues, but is not proceeding strongly, European Central Bank Executive Board member Lorenzo Bini Smaghi said on Tuesday, adding the central bank's interest rate path is open. 

 "The economy is recovering, not very strongly," Bini Smaghi said in an interview on CNBC television, when asked about the ECB's future interest rates. "We'll see how the economy evolves over the next few months, we are not committed to any specific path," he added. Bini Smaghi also said Italy would achieve a balanced budget in 2014 and that the country's debt-to-GDP ratio would come down quite quickly after that.
