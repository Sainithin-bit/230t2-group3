 LONDON  (Reuters) - BP PLC Chief Executive Bob Dudley tried to soothe investor frustration at the oil major's sluggish share price by promising rapid long-term growth as he gave a weak short-term outlook. 

 BP reported second quarter replacement cost net income of $5.31 billion on Tuesday, as higher crude prices more than outweighed the impact of a drop in production after the company sold fields to pay for the Gulf of Mexico oil spill. The result compares with a loss of $16.97 billion in the same period last year, after the company took a $32 billion charge for oil spill costs. Excluding one-offs, the result was $5.61 billion, shy of an average forecast of $6.02 billion, from a Reuters poll of 12 analysts. (Reporting by  Tom Bergin )
