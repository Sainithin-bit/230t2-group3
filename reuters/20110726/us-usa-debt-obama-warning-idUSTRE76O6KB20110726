 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - President Barack Obama will warn on Monday during a televised address to Americans that the failure of Congress to take steps to lift the debt ceiling would severely harm the United States, the White house said. 

 "President Obama, like Democratic and Republican Presidents before him, will make clear that failure to compromise and raise the debt ceiling would, in the words of former President Reagan, do 'incalculable damage'," a White House official said.
