 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - The European Central Bank's interest rates remain historically very low even after two hikes this year, ECB Governing Council member Andres Lipstok said in an opinion piece for a newspaper released on Tuesday. 

 "The possibility that continuing economic growth in the euro area will start exerting an upward pressure on prices is also quite realistic," he wrote in Postimees, a newspaper in Estonia, where he is chief of the national central bank. Later in the piece, he added: "Moreover, even after the recent increase in key interest rates, monetary policy interest rates still remain very low in historical comparison."
