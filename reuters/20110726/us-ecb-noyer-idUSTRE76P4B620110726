 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - The European Central Bank is exercising 'grande vigilance' on inflation, Bank of France chief Christian Noyer said, which the BoF insisted meant 'strong alertness' and not 'strong vigilance' -- a phrase signaling an imminent rate hike. 

 Noyer told the Financial Times Deutschland that rising raw materials costs and tax increases in some euro zone countries meant there was a risk of price rises despite softer growth in the second quarter. "The ECB Council remains in a position of very strong vigilance, without us deciding in advance what we will do," he added in the interview published in the newspaper's Tuesday edition. But a Bank of France spokeswoman said that Noyer's comment -- 'grande vigilance' in French -- should have been translated as 'strong alertness' in English and that this is what he would have said had he been speaking English. The incident was the latest in a recent string of bungled communications episodes involving top ECB policymakers, and highlights the difficulty incoming ECB president Mario Draghi will have in keeping all 23 of them on the same page. Last week, Austria's central bank chief wavered from the ECB's line on Greece before complying. The ECB's incumbent president, Jean-Claude Trichet, has been a master of communication. Draghi is less experienced in delivering the bank's nuanced policy messages. Under Trichet, the phrase 'strong vigilance' has regularly been deployed to signal a rate rise at the ECB's next policy meeting, including before the two hikes it has made this year -- in April and July. TIGHTENING CYCLE Money markets have priced out any further ECB rate hikes this year and economists were sceptical about whether Governing Council member Noyer was intending to signal that the bank was ready to move immediately. But at the very least his comments suggested the ECB is open to tightening policy again this year despite market concerns over the euro zone's growth prospects as many countries struggle with debt problems. "I think he just indicated that the ECB has not changed its outlook on inflation yet and that it is still in this tightening cycle and that they want to tighten," added Berenberg Bank economist Christian Schulz. Schulz expected the ECB to raise rates again in December. Another ECB policymaker, Executive Board member Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, said the economy in the common currency region was not growing strongly and that more data was needed before deciding on whether to further increase interest rates. "The economy is recovering, not very strongly," Bini Smaghi said in an interview on CNBC television, when asked about the ECB's future interest rates. "We'll see how the economy evolves over the next few months. We are not committed to any specific path," he added. The ECB's Governing Council meets next Thursday for a monthly policy meeting -- one of just three left for Trichet. The Frenchman's eight-year term expires in October and Draghi is due to succeed him from November. No major shift in ECB monetary policy is expected under Draghi. "The ECB never pre-commits on monetary policy," Noyer said. "We want to signal clearly that the inflation pressure as a result of the rise in oil and raw materials prices may not turn into permanent price rises via second-round effects," he added. Inflation is running well above the ECB's target of close to but below 2 percent, with rising fuel and electricity prices the main drivers behind an annual 2.7-percent rise in euro zone consumer prices in June. Estonian central banker and ECB Governing Council member Andres Lipstok said rates were still historically very low and warned of inflation pressures. The ECB raised its key interest rate by a 1/4 of a percentage point to 1.5 percent earlier this month to counter the risk posed by firm price pressures. "It would be very unusual to hike two meetings in a row," said Credit Agricole strategist Peter Chatwell. "I think we have to assume that this is a reminder of the ECB's position, rather than a higher-level signal of an imminent hike." Turning to fiscal policy in the 17-country euro zone, Noyer said the issuance of common Euro bonds was something he could only imagine in the long run when the bloc had demonstrated collective budget discipline. "For me, Euro bonds can only be realised when we have shown convincingly over a long time period that we are capable of collective budgetary discipline and have mechanisms that ensure this discipline will actually be adhered to," he said.
