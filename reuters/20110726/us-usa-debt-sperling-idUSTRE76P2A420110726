 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - President Barack Obama's top economic adviser said on Tuesday that Republicans and Democrats could reach a budget deal this week with "a minimum amount of compromise." 

 "There is a lot of good will that I believe still exists," National Economic Council head Gene Sperling said in an interview with CNN about the stalled budget talks. "We just need a minimum amount of compromise, a minimum amount of not 'my way or the highway' and we can get there this week," he said. Although contingency plans are in the works to meet government obligations in case no agreement is reached to increase U.S. borrowing authority before the $14.3 trillion debt ceiling is hit on August 2, he said, "there is no way we should get even near that."
