 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank AG ( DBKGn.DE ) warned of weakness to come in its core investment banking division, laying bare the challenge facing its two new CEOs named only hours earlier. 

 The bank warned it may miss its goal of generating 6.4 billion euros pretax profit ($9.2 billion) from investment banking due to the European debt crisis. The target is now "dependent on swift and sustained resolution of the European sovereign debt crisis and a return to a significantly improved operating environment in the second half of 2011," said Germany's flagship bank, although it reaffirmed its aim to deliver 10 billion euros for the group as a whole, with other divisions taking up the slack. That leaves the global investment banking heavyweight more dependent on retail banking and wealth and asset management to meet the full-year targets set by outgoing Chief Executive Josef Ackermann, and analysts remain skeptical. "Nobody really believed that Deutsche would reach its 10 billion euros goal," Philipp Haessler, an analyst at Frankfurt-based Equinet, said. A Reuters poll compiled before Deutsche Bank published its results showed that banks and brokerages on average expect the lender to post 2011 pretax profit of about 8.7 billion euros. Poor trading has also dampened results at rival Goldman Sachs ( GS.N ) and forced Switzerland's UBS ( UBSN.VX ) to slash costs and scrap earnings targets set in 2009. Deutsche Bank shares were down 1 percent at 37.84 euros by 1003 GMT, outperforming the STOXX Europe 600 Banks index .SX7P, which was 1.2 percent lower. ACKERMANN STILL POWERFUL Deutsche Bank's earnings figures come only hours after it named investment banking head Anshu Jain and Juergen Fitschen, head of its business in Germany, as co-chief executives from 2012. Fears that Deutsche Bank could neglect its German roots and expand risk-taking activities prompted key members of the supervisory board to opt for the dual CEO model, adding Fitschen's contact book in Germany to Jain's ability to deliver profits. Deutsche Bank also said it would elevate Ackermann to the position of supervisory board chairman. "With the dual leadership model and Ackermann as chairman the bank has ensured that the investment banking unit as well as the traditional banking business will be expanded," said Helmut Hipper, fund manager at Union Investment, which is the lender's 11th biggest shareholder. Jain could eventually become standalone chief executive, with Deutsche Bank saying his contract would be extended by five years until March 2017. Fitschen's contract is set to expire almost two years before that. But some industry observers said Deutsche Bank's decision to keep Ackermann on as chairman, also announced late on Monday, would put a leash on Jain. "We are concerned that Ackermann moving from CEO to Chairman would maintain the status quo in strategy - meaning business as usual on an operational basis with Anshu Jain constrained in making his mark on the group," analysts at J.P. Morgan said. A co-CEO model with two powerful executives did not prove durable for Credit Suisse ( CSGN.VX ). Oswald Gruebel and John Mack headed up Credit Suisse from January 2003 until July 2004, when it was announced Mack's contract would not be renewed. Deutsche Bank's second-quarter pretax profit rose 17 percent to 1.8 billion euros, falling short of the 1.97 billion consensus in a Reuters poll. Net profit remained flat at 1.2 billion euros. It took a 155 million-euro impairment on Greek government bonds in the quarter. Last week, Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ) surprised Wall Street with better-than-expected earnings, driven by strong trading in equity and fixed-income markets. That provided a sharp contrast with rival Goldman Sachs ( GS.N ), which rattled investors with disappointing earnings and a 53 percent revenue drop in its fixed income, commodities and currencies business last week.
