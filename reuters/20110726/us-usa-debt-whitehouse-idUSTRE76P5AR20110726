 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The White House said on Tuesday that the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution was "not available" to President Barack Obama to avoid the August 2 deadline to raise the U.S. debt ceiling. 

 "There are no easy ways out here. There are no tricks, there is no citing of the Constitution that suddenly allow us to borrow," White House press secretary Jay Carney told reporters. "It's not available." (Reporting by  Laura MacInnis  and  Alister Bull ; Editing by  Will Dunham )
