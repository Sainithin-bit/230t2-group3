 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - United Parcel Service Inc ( UPS.N ), the world's largest package delivery company, gave a cautious economic outlook and cited stalled U.S. debt ceiling talks, pushing its shares down nearly 4 percent on Tuesday. 

 UPS, which posted a higher quarterly profit and affirmed its view for record 2011 earnings, voiced caution about peak season shipments because of economic uncertainty and the deadlocked negotiations over the U.S. debt. "If Congress and the president resolve the debt ceiling issue satisfactorily in the next week, the mood of the country could change pretty quickly," UPS Chief Executive Scott Davis told analysts on a conference call. Without a resolution, or free-trade agreements, the company's business customers are keeping inventory thin and expansion plans on hold, UPS said. U.S. consumer sentiment edged up in July, but labor market worries kept consumers gloomy. "While fuel prices have come down some and Japan appears to be recovering, high unemployment and weak consumer confidence continue," Davis said. "The end of the second round of quantitative easing and the government debt issues only add to the uncertainty." As a result, he said second-half U.S. gross domestic product could be anywhere within a wide range of 1.5 percent to 3.5 percent and harder than usual to estimate. Second-quarter GDP being reported on Friday is seen having grown at a 1.8 percent rate, down from 1.9 percent in the first quarter. Jeffrey Kauffman, a managing director at Sterne Agee, said the company's record quarterly results show resilience in the face of a tenuous economy and political wranglings. UPS had pricing power in all of its business segments, he said. "I didn't interpret this as UPS saying 'look out below,' I interpreted it as UPS delivering a message to our politicians saying 'don't put political ambitions ahead of a recovery that needs to sustain.'" UPS handles goods equal to 6 percent of the U.S. GDP and 2 percent of global GDP in its trucks and planes, so its shipment trends give a tangible view of consumer demand. Its shares were down 3.6 percent at $71.36 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. They have declined about 1.5 percent so far this year. Smaller rival FedEx ( FDX.N ) in June said cost controls and higher shipping rates more than offset the slowing economic recovery and high fuel prices in its fourth quarter, and forecast an improved second-half economy. Its shares were 1 percent lower at $90.95, down about 2.2 percent so far this year. In the quarter, UPS's international shipment volume escalated while domestic deliveries stayed flat because of the tepid U.S. economy. Global trade is a key focus at UPS, as Davis is on the President's Export Council that aims to drive U.S. business growth by doubling exports by 2015. "International growth is really bearing fruit for them," said Kevin Sterling, a BB&T analyst. "The thing that caught my eye is they continued to add flights in and out of China. The company, which said export volume rose about 8 percent in the quarter, announced it launched a new flight between Europe and western China this week. Davis said there will be "tremendous growth in western China over the next five years and we think we are in a position to well serve that market." In April, when UPS raised its 2011 guidance to the current record high between $4.15 and $4.40 per share, it noted its cost-containment efforts and little customer resistance to higher rates. CASH STASH Atlanta-based UPS on Tuesday reported net earnings of $1.063 billion, or $1.07 per share, up from $845 million, or 84 cents a share a year ago. Adjusted earnings were $1.05 per share, slightly beating the $1.04 per share that economists expected on average, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. UPS is ending the first half of the year with $2.3 billion in free cash flow, even after accelerated pension contributions and spending on four B-767 and two B-747-400 aircraft. "We do think businesses and consumers are cautious given the chaos that seems to be, especially in Washington these days," Chief Financial Officer Kurt Kuehn said in an interview. "Nonetheless the company is in great shape and we feel very confident that we can manage through this environment while still growing the business and producing record earnings." The highest second-quarter earnings per share on record were driven by "the quality of revenue in the U.S. domestic, superior export volume growth in International and record supply chain & freight results," he said. Revenue rose to $13.2 billion from $12.2 billion a year ago, slightly edging above analyst forecasts of $13.14 billion. (Reporting by Lynn Adler, editing by Dave Zimmerman and Maureen Bavdek)
