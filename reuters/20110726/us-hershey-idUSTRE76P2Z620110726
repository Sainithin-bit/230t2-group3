 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Hershey Co ( HSY.N ) reported higher-than-expected quarterly results and raised its full-year outlook, showing that consumers are willing to pay more to satisfy their sweet tooth even in a weak economy. 

 Like most food and beverage companies, the world's largest chocolate maker raised prices to offset soaring costs for commodities such as cocoa and dairy. But those price increases have not dented demand as much as they have in other product categories. "Candy has always been thought of as more of an affordable luxury, and that really seems to be playing out despite the pressures that consumers are under," said Morningstar analyst Erin Lash. Hershey, home to brands such as Reese's, Kit Kat and Twizzlers, expects 2011 earnings to rise by about 10 percent and sales to increase by about 6 percent. It had earlier forecast sales at the high end of its 3 percent to 5 percent forecast and profit at the high end of its 6 percent to 8 percent forecast. The company sees full-year earnings of $2.79 to $2.82 per share, excluding 11 cents to 12 cents per share in one-time charges. Analysts on average were expecting $2.81 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. But sales in the overall U.S. candy category have slowed in the last four to eight weeks, said Hershey Chief Executive John Bilbrey. He said the category should perform at its historical 3 percent to 4 percent level for the rest of the year, as big holidays like Halloween allow retailers to lock in prices, somewhat erasing earlier benefits from price increases. In international markets including Mexico, China, Brazil and India, Hershey expects sales to grow about 15 percent this year and said it will continue to make investments abroad to expand sales. Hershey shares, which had gained nearly 24 percent this year through Monday, were down 16 cents, or 0.3 percent, at $58.48 on Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange. PRICE INCREASES HELP SALES Net income rose to $130.0 million, or 56 cents per share in the second quarter, from $46.7 million, or 20 cents per share, a year earlier, when the company had several one-time charges. Analysts on average were expecting 55 cents per share. Sales rose 7.5 percent to $1.33 billion, topping the average analyst estimate of $1.28 billion and the company's own initial forecast. Hershey cited volume gains in both the United States and abroad. Higher prices, primarily in the United States, added 3 percentage points of growth to sales, while foreign exchange rates added a half a point, the company said. Hershey announced a price increase in March of nearly 10 percent on some products to offset higher ingredient costs. It said on Tuesday that its outlook for commodity inflation was unchanged for the year. In his first conference call with investors as Hershey's CEO, Bilbrey said the company was committed to doing business in India, even if the nature of its presence there might change. Hershey's Indian business has struggled amid the dominance of Cadbury, owned by Kraft Foods KFT.N. He did not comment specifically on the future of Hershey's joint venture with India's Godrej Consumer Products ( GOCP.NS ).
