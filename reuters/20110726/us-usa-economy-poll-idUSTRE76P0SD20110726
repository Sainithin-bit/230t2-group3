 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - More than a third of Americans believe President Barack Obama's policies have made the U.S. economy worse, but they blame Republicans just as much, according to a Washington Post-ABC News poll published on Tuesday. 

 The percentage of people who said Obama, a Democrat, has made the economy worse rose 6 points since October to 37 percent, the public opinion poll found. But as many Americans blame Republicans in Congress for America's economic woes as they do Obama, the poll of more than 1,000 people found. It said 65 percent of respondents said they disapprove of the Republicans' handling of jobs, compared with 52 percent who disapprove of Obama's efforts. Ninety percent said the economy was not doing well; 85 percent said they were just getting by or falling behind and four out of five respondents said jobs were very difficult to find. The president's 2012 re-election prospects hinge on his ability to address the 9.2 percent U.S. jobless rate. Obama receives higher marks from independent voters than Republicans when it comes to jobs, but appeasing supporters in his own party could be a bigger challenge. According to the poll, the number of liberal Democrats who strongly support Obama's record on jobs plunged 22 points from 53 percent last year to 31 percent. The Washington Post-ABC News poll was taken July 14-17 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points. (Reporting by  JoAnne Allen ; editing by  Doina Chiacu )
