 NEW YORK (Reuters) -Eastman Kodak Co EK.N posted a bigger loss and lower revenue, as the once-iconic photography company struggled to shift its focus from selling film and toward selling digital cameras and printers. 

 Kodak's second-quarter loss from continuing operations increased to $179 million, or 67 cents per share from a loss of $167 million, or 62 cents a year earlier. Revenue fell 5 percent to $1.49 billion. Analysts were expecting revenue of $1.53 billion. (Reporting by  Liana B. Baker ; Editing by  Derek Caney )
