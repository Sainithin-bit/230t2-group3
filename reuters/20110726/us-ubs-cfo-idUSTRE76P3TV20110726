 ZURICH  (Reuters) - Swiss bank UBS ( UBSN.VX ) ( UBS.N ) is talking to regulators about issuing alternatives to contingent convertibles, or CoCos, given their concerns that these relatively untested instruments can dilute equity. 

 UBS Chief Financial officer Tom Naratil told Reuters on Tuesday that he shared the skepticism of UBS Chief Executive Oswald Gruebel about CoCo bonds, which have been touted by the Swiss government as a useful new issue to help the industry meet tough post-crisis capital rules. "There are other forms of loss absorbing capital that are non-dilutive that could be used subject to regulatory approval," Naratil said in an interview, adding that UBS was in the "very early stages" of discussions with regulators. CoCos are bonds that convert into equity if a bank's capital falls to a set level and Gruebel said they were dangerous as they could accelerate a sell-off and dilute the bank's share capital. In a blow to the nascent CoCo market last month, global banking regulators ruled that the instruments cannot count toward an extra capital charge on the world's biggest banks. However the Swiss have drawn up their own, stricter capital rules and have kept CoCos as an option. UBS's Swiss rival Credit Suisse ( CSGN.VX ) announced earlier this year it is issuing CoCo bonds, while Barclays Bank ( BARC.L ) said last month it might sell securities later this year that are non-dilutive. The Swiss government wants to make UBS and Credit Suisse hold Tier 1 equity type capital of at least 10 percent, compared with 7 percent under new industry rules known as Basel III, plus a further 9 percent of other forms of capital, such as CoCo bonds, lifting the total capital ratio to a hefty 19 percent. Naratil said UBS wanted to meet tough new Swiss capital rules -- expected to be approved by parliament in coming months -- as quickly as possible and reiterated that the bank's primary means of building up capital was by retaining earnings. "We want to be in the position where it's clear people have confidence in us. The capital base is an important thing for wealth management clients," he said. Naratil made the comments after UBS announced on Tuesday it will slash jobs and review the future of its fixed income business after the underperforming unit hit second-quarter profits and forced it to push back targets. "Increasing capital requirements create a backdrop that forces you to talk about efficiency in your business," he said. (Reporting by  Emma Thomasson ; editing by Sophie Walker and  Jane Merriman )
