 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - President Barack Obama on Thursday proposed a multibillion-dollar fee on financial firms -- taking on a sector that has become a public foe and a political foil ahead of this year's midterm elections. 

 Obama, enraged by banks' "massive profits and obscene bonuses," intends to recover up to $117 billion from the fee to repay the cost of the bailout program known as TARP (Troubled Asset Relief Program). Here's a look at possible results of the move -- both negative and positive: * A populist victory. It's an election year and unemployment is in double digits. With majorities for Obama's Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate at risk in November's poll, it's always nice to have an enemy to vanquish. As a rough employment picture dominates the minds of many Americans, Obama's focus on bankers' bonuses is bound to earn him points. With the proposed fee, Obama casts himself as leader who is acting on citizens' outrage over taxpayer money being used to bolster banks' bottom lines. It also shows that despite the administration's commitment to reviving the sector to help the economy, Obama does not intend for taxpayers to foot the bill forever. That is likely to play well with an economically-harried electorate. * A deficit plug. Political implications aside, Obama's fee would generate actual cash to cover the remaining costs of TARP and keep the deficit from exploding further. That is likely to generate kudos from both Republicans and Democrats who are concerned about the ramifications of the U.S. debt load and budget deficit. It also dovetails with Obama's goal of making deficit reduction a key priority in 2010. * A potential backlash. A government-mandated fee on financial institutions is not without political risks. Banks could pass on the fees to their customers, extending the penalty to the taxpayers whom Obama was trying to protect. * A failed foil. By focusing the White House's message machine on a battle against banks, critics may see an attempt to change the subject from other perceived failures of the president's one-year administration on the economy and in foreign policy. Even if the fee achieves its goals, collecting that money will not be the key to creating jobs and turning the U.S. economy around for good. (Editing by  Vicki Allen )
