 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - LSI Logic Corp., a maker of chips for DVD recorders and hard drives, said on Monday that it closed its $3.5 billion purchase of chip maker Agere Systems Inc. and is eyeing job cuts or consolidating facilities to save $125 million in 2008. 

 The company, which will be renamed LSI Corp., also estimated savings from combining product development operations and the ability to buy materials in greater bulk. "Obviously we will look across all dimensions from where we have some redundancies from a multiple functions and skills standpoint, where we have redundancy or possible opportunities to consolidate facilities," LSI Logic President and Chief Executive Abhi Talwalkar said in an interview with Reuters, without giving details. "The $125 million will be made up of many different elements," he said, also citing savings on investments in the latest manufacturing and design technologies that both companies would have had to do separately. LSI Corp. will have 9,100 employees, including about 4,300 engineers, and will operate in more than 20 countries. Talwalkar said the company was already seeing signs it can win new business as a result of the deal. "We've been having a number of "what if?" discussions with our customers and some of our largest customers," he said, citing talks about expanding supply agreements at strong LSI or Agere customers to include the other's products. "We are already seeing the right indications that this will result in new business," he said without giving numbers. Talwalkar said he was confident LSI would achieve savings targets it had outlined in December. It had forecast 2008 savings of at least $125 million through improvements in manufacturing efficiency and management of operating expenses. It had also said in December that the deal would reduce LSI's earnings per share slightly in 2007 and add to them "meaningfully" in 2008. On March 29, shareholders of both Agere and LSI had approved a December 4 agreement for Agere shareholders to receive 2.16 shares of LSI for each Agere share held.
