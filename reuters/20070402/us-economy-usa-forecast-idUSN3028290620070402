 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - A credit crunch stemming from turmoil in the subprime mortgage market will trigger further weakness in housing and keep U.S. economic growth "below trend" most of this year, a UCLA Anderson Forecast unit said in a report on Monday. 

 The sluggish growth will help clear the way for the Federal Reserve to ease monetary policy at the end of the second quarter despite a historically low 4.5 percent unemployment rate, the economic forecasting unit said in its report. Citing Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke's recent comments about the link between inflation and employment levels appearing "looser" than in past decades, the unit projected three cuts to the Fed Funds rate by the end of the year, taking it to 4.5 percent from 5.25 percent currently. "Given the level of unemployment such a move would be unprecedented, but we believe that the Fed is rethinking the role of unemployment in the inflation process," the report said. "Thus we suspect that once the Fed accepts the notion that inflationary pressure has peaked and the housing market has started another leg down, policy will be eased." Housing data will be key, said David Shulman, the economist who wrote the report: "If they see the housing numbers coming in as ugly as we do, we think they will ease pretty quickly." ALL EYES ON HOUSING The housing sector, already suffering from a fat backlog of homes for sale, lukewarm demand and flat to falling prices, is poised for a blow from increasing defaults by subprime mortgage borrowers, Shulman told Reuters. "Housing is subtracting a whole point from gross domestic product," he said. "That is going to continue until we hit the fourth quarter." GDP will grow by 2.1 percent in the first quarter, 1.7 percent in the second quarter, and 2.5 percent in the third quarter, resulting in six consecutive quarters of below-trend growth, Shulman said. Economic growth will then rise to 3.1 percent in the fourth quarter to average 2.2 percent for the year, followed by growth of 3.1 percent in 2008 and 3.4 percent in 2009, Shulman said. "The days of wine and roses for the mortgage market are over," he said. HOME FINANCE FALLOUT Borrowers with spotty credit serviced by subprime lenders snapped up adjustable-rate mortgages with low initial interest rates, but are now being hit with swelling mortgage payments as their loans reset at higher rates. A wave of defaults on the loans has swamped subprime lenders, shaking financial markets in recent weeks and prompting many analysts to suspect borrowers with better credit and adjustable-rate mortgages may also soon be strapped with ballooning mortgage payments after rates on their loans reset. "We're in the second inning of this," Shulman said. "For a lot of folks the numbers just don't work out at market rates." Rising defaults already suggest the inventory of unsold homes will grow, pressuring beleaguered home builders and further paring their contribution to economic and job growth. Shulman sees 5 percent unemployment in the second half of 2007 and has lowered his outlook for housing starts this year. He had initially expected a bottom of about 1.4 million to 1.5 million units, but now sees a bottom of about 1.2 million to 1.3 million units with "risks still on the down side." Homeowners will also be stung by mortgage troubles as lenders tighten loan standards, creating a credit crunch hitting hardest at first-time buyers. Depending on the area, prices of homes for sale this year will fall 5 percent to 10 percent from peaks of recent years, Shulman said.
