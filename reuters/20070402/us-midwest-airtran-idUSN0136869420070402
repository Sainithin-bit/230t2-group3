 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - AirTran Holdings Inc. AAI.N, the parent company of AirTran Airways, said on Monday it increased its offer to purchase the outstanding shares of Midwest Air Group MEH.A to $15 per Midwest share, based on the closing price of AirTran common stock on March 30, 2007. 

 The hostile takeover bid now consists of $9 in cash and 0.5842 shares of AirTran common stock for each Midwest share. The total equity value of the exchange offer is $389 million. The offer represents a premium of 83 percent over the 30-day average closing price of Midwest common stock prior to AirTran's initial proposal. AirTran's first offer to acquire all of Midwest's common stock was priced at $11.25 per share on October 20, 2006. The offer also represents an approximately 65 percent premium over the closing price of Midwest stock on December 12, 2006, the day before AirTran disclosed its initial October 20 offer. As a result of this increase, the expiration date of the tender has been extended to terminate on May 16, 2007. "We firmly believe in the underlying value and benefits of combining these companies, and we are committed to bringing together these two airlines to create a truly national airline well-positioned for success in an increasingly competitive environment," said Joe Leonard, AirTran chairman and chief executive officer. "We are presenting this substantially enhanced offer now in order to give their board and management time to consider it and enter into discussions with us prior to Midwest's May 23, 2007, annual meeting," he said in a statement.
