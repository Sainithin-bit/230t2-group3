 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Staff at the Los Angeles Times, shaken by months of turmoil, voiced anxiety on Monday over Chicago billionaire Sam Zell's planned buyout even as the paper ran a story about the real estate mogul's reputation as a hard-nosed "grave dancer." 

 The Times' corporate parent, Tribune Co., announced it had accepted Zell's bid for $34 per share to take the newspaper and broadcasting giant private under an employee stock ownership (ESOP) plan entitling him to buy 40 percent of Tribune's common stock. The estimated $8.2 billion bid includes a $350 million investment by Zell, with the remainder essentially being financed by money the Tribune would otherwise have contributed to employees' retirement plans. "There is definitely trepidation and uncertainty," reporter Andrew Blankstein told Reuters. "The employees are going to be taking on a lot of the risk of the deal. But they could also get rewards. The question in a struggling industry is which way do we go?" The Times, the nation's fourth-largest newspaper and crown jewel of a media conglomerate that owns numerous TV stations and several major newspapers, has come under mounting pressure from its corporate parent to cut costs -- and jobs. Former editor Dean Baquet, widely admired inside the paper, quit in November after resisting management demands for further staff reductions. "MAKE IT A BETTER NEWSPAPER" Some staffers expressed qualms that Zell lacks previous newspaper experience and that the 65-year-old Chicagoan has described his Tribune bid strictly as a financial investment. Others said they would wait to learn more about his intentions before forming an opinion. "What we're looking for is an owner who wants to build the company and make it a better newspaper and recognizes that we have a public service role," veteran legal affairs reporter Henry Weinstein. He added: "I'm not passing any judgments until we hear something from (Zell) about what he's going to do with the newspaper." Times media critic Tim Rutten said, "I think there's a great deal of uncertainty ... because it's a very ambiguous kind of agreement, whose implications for the journalism of the Tribune papers are pretty uncertain." Many Times staffers were widely known to have been rooting for a rival Tribune bid from two Los Angeles billionaires -- philanthropist Eli Broad and supermarket magnate Ron Burkle -- that would have returned the newspaper to local ownership. Hollywood music mogul David Geffen has made a separate bid for the newspaper alone. Since it was acquired by Chicago-based Tribune in 2000, the Times often has found itself at odds with its corporate parent. "There's been no love lost between L.A. and Chicago, and the fact that (Zell) is a real estate guy from Chicago just kind of reinforces this idea that once again we're going to be the ones who are on the outs," one Times reporter, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said. Ambivalence about the prospect of Zell's ownership was reflected in a lengthy story published by the Times on Monday on the front page of its business section, outlining his record as a real estate investor. Since becoming the largest mobile-home landlord in the United States, according to the Times, a Zell-led company has enlisted teams of lawyers to challenge local rent-control laws and raise rents in cities across the country. The story said Zell has nicknamed himself the Grave Dancer because of his knack for turning a profit through investments in financially distressed properties.
