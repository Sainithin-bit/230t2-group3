 SYDNEY  (Reuters) - Australian conglomerate Wesfarmers Ltd. WES.AX led a A$3 billion ($2.5 billion) raid on Coles Group Ltd. CGJ.AX late on Monday, positioning itself for a takeover bid for the struggling retailer, local media reported on Tuesday. 

 Macquarie Bank MBL.AX, acting on Wesfarmers behalf, picked up about 3.3 percent of Coles in two trades at A$16.47 after the market close, the Sydney Morning Herald newspaper reported citing market sources. "The Herald understands it has agreements with institutional shareholders to lock up 10 percent of the company," it said. The paper said Wesfarmers was positioning itself for a potential A$20 billion hostile bid for Coles, which put itself up for sale in February, alongside private equity group Pacific Equity Partners. The Australian Financial Review paper, in an unsourced report, said the consortium also consisted of Macquarie Bank Ltd. MBL.AX and European buyout fund Permira. "Wesfarmers is likely to use the stake to get its hands on Coles' specialty office products division, the A$1.1 billion Officeworks chain," the Review reported. It added that Melbourne millionaire Solomon Lew, who controls the Premier Investments vehicle which held a 5.8 percent stake in Coles, was believed to have sold shares in the raid. "There was speculation last night that Mr Lew might have negotiated a deal to extract the Target stores from the group in exchange for selling his shares," the Herald said. ($1=A$1.22)
