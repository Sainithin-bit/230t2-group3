 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japanese companies are slightly less optimistic about business conditions than they were three months ago amid growing concerns about the outlook for the U.S. and global economies, the Bank of Japan's March tankan survey showed on Monday. 

 The headline diffusion index (DI) for big manufacturers' sentiment was at plus 23, slightly lower than a two-year-high reading of plus 25 in the December survey and just short of the market's median forecast of plus 24. The DI is calculated by subtracting the percentage of unfavorable responses from favorable ones. A positive number means optimists outnumber pessimists. The BOJ conducted regular revisions to sample enterprises in the tankan in early March and some of December tankan figures have been revised. Following is a summary of details of the survey from a briefing by a central bank official. -- The index for big manufacturers worsened for the first time in a year and its level was the lowest since last June, when it stood at plus 21. -- The index for small manufacturers worsened for the first time in two quarters and the reading of plus 8 was the lowest since September 2006. The index for small non-manufacturers, minus 6, was also the lowest level since September 2006. -- Large firms in all categories plan to increase capital spending for fiscal 2007/08 by 2.9 percent. That is the biggest rise planned as of a March tankan survey since fiscal 1990/91, when firms had forecast a 5.0 percent increase in spending. -- The employment index for big manufacturers at minus 7 was the lowest since February 1992 and that for small non-manufacturers, minus 13, was the lowest since February 1993, suggesting work-force shortages. The employment index is the percentage of firms that say they have excess workers minus those who say they do not have enough workers. -- The production capacity index for big manufacturers stood at zero, the first time since December 2005 it was not in minus territory, suggesting less demand for capital spending. The output capacity index is the percentage of firms that say they have sufficient output capacity minus those who say they do not have enough capacity. -- The interest rate loan index for big firms was at plus 44, the highest level since September 2000, suggesting that more companies feel their cost of borrowing has risen. The index measures the percentage of firms that say interest rates for their loans have risen minus those who say they have fallen. -- The business conditions index for real estate firms, plus 53, was the highest level since February 1991, when it stood at plus 60.
