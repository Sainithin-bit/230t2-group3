 LONDON  (Reuters) - EMI Group Plc said on Monday it was making its music catalog available through Apple Inc's iTunes store without the anti-piracy measure known as digital rights management (DRM). 

 "The new higher quality DRM-free music will complement EMI's existing range of standard DRM-protected downloads already available," EMI said in a statement as the company began a joint press conference in central London with Apple Chief Executive Steve Jobs.
