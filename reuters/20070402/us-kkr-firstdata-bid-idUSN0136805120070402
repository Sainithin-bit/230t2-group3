 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. plans to offer $25.6 billion for payment processor First Data Corp., a source familiar with the matter said, in what could become the second-largest private equity buyout. 

 KKR is in late stage discussions with the company about the proposal, which at $34 per share in cash represents a 26 percent premium to Friday's closing price of $26.90 per share. A deal could be announced as early as Monday, the source said. KKR declined to comment. A First Data spokeswoman did not return a call or email seeking comment. With private equity firms competing hard for large buyout targets, a deal with First Data would put KKR the firm behind the top three largest leveraged buyouts. KKR and Texas Pacific Group reached a deal in February to buy Texas Utility TXU Corp. for nearly $32 billion in cash. KKR bought RJR Nabisco for $25.1 billion in 1988.
