 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Chicago real estate magnate Sam Zell won the bidding for newspaper publisher and broadcaster Tribune Co., The Wall Street Journal reported on Monday, citing a person familiar with the matter. 

 A deal with Zell could freeze out Los Angeles billionaire philanthropist Eli Broad and his partner, billionaire grocery store investor Ron Burkle, who had also bid for Tribune. Tribune, owner of leading U.S. newspapers including the Los Angeles Times, Chicago Tribune, Newsday and The Baltimore Sun, has been pushing Zell to raise his bid, which had been close to $34 a share, the New York Times said on Sunday. Tribune shares rose 2.8 percent to $33 in premarket trading from Friday's close of $32.11. Broad and Burkle last week made a bid of $34 per share including $500 million in cash, a source said. That offer was worth about $8.21 billion, based on Tribune's 241.4 million shares outstanding as of December 31. Representatives for Tribune, Zell, Broad and Burkle were not immediately available for comment. The Journal said the exact terms of Zell's offer should be disclosed on Monday morning, including a low break-up fee that could encourage Broad and Burkle to make a higher offer. Media reports have said Zell's plan included $300 million of his own cash and was structured as an employee stock ownership plan, as is Broad's and Burke's bid. AUCTION PROCESS Tribune, which is also a major TV broadcaster and owns the Chicago Cubs baseball team, has been fielding several offers for a buyout or the spinoff of various divisions after its largest shareholder, the Chandler Trusts, publicly aired their anger with the decline in the company's stock price last year. The Chicago-based company has been considering a spinoff of its television operations as well as the Cubs, leaving it as a newspaper publisher, according to reports. Tribune started soliciting offers last fall, but was unimpressed with what it received. It said in January that it would consider options that it could achieve on its own. "Tribune is one of the biggest companies in the business so I think it was difficult for another media company (to bid), plus there were complications with the cross-ownership issues ... but it looks like they found a buyer," said Benchmark Co. analyst Ed Atorino. "I think it's good news for the shareholders, maybe good news for the group." Like most U.S. newspaper publishers, Tribune has seen advertising revenue and circulation fall at its papers as more people use the Internet to get news and entertainment. The company has stakes in online ventures, including jobs site Careerbuilder.com and local news search service Topix.net. It co-owns those companies with fellow publishers Gannett Co. Inc. and McClatchy Co. A special board committee met over the weekend to decide which option it preferred, with Tribune having said earlier that it would make a decision by March 31. Any successful bidder would have to deal with the approximately $5 billion in debt that Tribune has on its balance sheet, according to its annual report filed on February 26.
