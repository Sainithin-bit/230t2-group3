 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Xerox Corp. ( XRX.N ) said on Monday it will buy office technology products provider Global Imaging Systems Inc. GISX.O for $1.5 billion as it seeks to expand its reach in the small and mid-sized business markets. 

 The acquisition will be Xerox's third and largest in the past 12 months as the copy machine maker tries to boost growth in equipment revenue, a sore point in its fiscal third-quarter financial report. "Our biggest barrier to growth was distribution," Xerox Chairman and Chief Executive Anne Mulcahy said on a morning conference call with analysts. Global Imaging sells printers and copiers to small and mid-size businesses, and it will start selling Xerox document-management products following the acquisition. Xerox, the world's largest provider of office printers, copiers and related services, said it would pay $29 for each share of Global Imaging, a premium of almost 50 percent to its Friday closing price of $19.50. The price is equivalent to 11 times Global Imaging's earnings before interest and tax (EBIT), according to one analyst. Global Imaging's own deals to buy smaller independent distributors were valued on average at five to eight times trailing 12 month adjusted EBIT, according to Global Imaging investor relations representative Earle Brown. Global Imaging shares rose 46.9 percent, or $9.15, to $28.65. Xerox shares edged up 9 cents to $16.98. BOOSTING DISTRIBUTION The purchase will expand Xerox's distribution by 50 percent in the estimated $16 billion small to mid-sized business market. The deal is expected to close in May. Stamford, Connecticut-based Xerox said it expects the acquisition to boost 2007 earnings. "They don't overlap much," Soleil Cross Research analyst Shannon Cross said of the deal. "It makes a lot of sense from that standpoint ... To me this represents Xerox management's willingness to think outside the box, to be more entrepreneurial, to be more aggressive." The acquisition will add about 200,000 new customers. Global Imaging generates about $1 billion in annual sales, the company said. Founded in 1994, Global Imaging operates 21 regional companies and is the product of about 80 acquisitions. Xerox executives said Global, which will operate as a wholly owned subsidiary, will continue to seek purchase opportunities. "This is not a fixer upper," Mulcahy said on the call. "It's a really well run, high-performing company." The transaction has been structured as a two-step acquisition including a cash tender offer for all outstanding shares of Global common stock followed by a cash merger in which Xerox will acquire any remaining outstanding shares.
