 LONDON  (Reuters) - Five facts about Digital Rights 
Management (DRM) after Britain's EMI Group Plc said it 
would make all of its digital repertoire available without the 
the anti-piracy software. 

 * DRM is software which entertainment companies use to 
prevent illegal copying or distribution of digital media files 
such as songs and movies. * Apple Inc's proprietary Fairplay protection 
technology is one of the most commonly used to protect songs, TV 
shows and movies. Microsoft Corp. has its own Windows 
Media-based protection technology. * DRM protection of a song or movie can be used to prevent 
it from playing on a non-compatible digital media player or 
software. For example, Apple's Fairplay format will only work 
within Apple's iPod player and iTunes system. * The most popular digital song format, an unprotected MP3, 
does not have any DRM protection.  * More than 1 billion digital songs in MP3 format are traded 
illegally every month on peer-to-peer networks such as Limewire, 
according to Web consultants Big Champagne.
