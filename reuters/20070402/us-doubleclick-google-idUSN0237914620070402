 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Google Inc. ( GOOG.O ) has emerged along with Microsoft Corp. ( MSFT.O ) as a contender to buy DoubleClick Inc., presenting competition that stands to increase the final sale price of the online-advertising company, people familiar with the situation said in The Wall Street Journal. 

 Microsoft has appeared less likely to win the bidding as the potential price for the company surpassed $2 billion, people familiar with the situation said in the Journal. Yahoo Inc. ( YHOO.O ) and Time Warner Inc.'s ( TWX.N ) AOL online unit also have talked to DoubleClick -- which is majority-owned by San Francisco private-equity firm Hellman & Friedman -- though it is unclear whether AOL is still in the race, these people said in the Journal. DoubleClick is using investment bank Morgan Stanley to help explore its options, including a possible stock market listing, the Journal reported last week. Hellman & Freidman has reportedly set a price tag of at least $2 billion for the advertising company. Such a price tag could amount to a hefty return for the private equity firm, which took DoubleClick private in mid-2005 in a deal worth $1.1 billion. Representatives from Google were not immediately available for comment.
