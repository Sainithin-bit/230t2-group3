 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japanese companies are slightly less optimistic about business conditions than they were three months ago amid uncertainty over the outlook for the U.S. and global economies, the Bank of Japan's March tankan survey showed on Monday. 

 The survey's results did little to alter expectations in the financial markets that the central bank will not move to tighten credit at least until July-September after a rate hike in February. The headline diffusion index (DI) for big manufacturers' sentiment was at plus 23, slightly lower than a two-year-high reading of plus 25 in the December survey and falling short of the market's median forecast of plus 24. KEY POINTS: - The June DI for big manufacturers was seen at plus 20, showing those firms expect conditions to slightly worsen over the next three months. - Big firms expect their capital spending to rise 2.9 percent in the new fiscal year that started on April 1, compared with the market's median forecast for a 1.7 percent rise. - The BOJ conducted regular revisions to sample enterprises in the tankan in early March, and some of the December tankan figures have been revised. COMMENTARY: YOSHIKI SHINKE, ECONOMIST, DAI-ICHI LIFE RESEARCH INSTITUTE "Overall, the figures were in line with expectations. "This tankan confirms that economic growth somewhat slowed down in January-March. "The capital spending outlook for the 2007 fiscal year looks similar to the 2006 fiscal year, when spending was brisk ... so relatively strong capital outlays are likely to be seen this business year again. "I don't think this tankan would affect the BOJ's policy since it was in line with expectations." JAN LAMBREGTS, HEAD OF ASIA RESEARCH, RABOBANK, HONG KONG "The headline sentiment was a bit weaker than expected, but this is not disconcerting. The services sector is holding up well. "Overall, against a backdrop of mixed figures, the survey confirms that the recovery is on track. "No one expects the Bank of Japan to hike interest rates in the next couple of months. One reason is elections coming up, and we know the BOJ is sensitive to political pressure. The other reason is that consumer prices have dipped back into negative territory, so it will be hard to sell a rate hike." MAKOTO YAMASHITA, CHIEF JGB STRATEGIST, LEHMAN BROTHERS "The tankan was generally within expectations. The DI is already at a high level, so unless the big manufacturers' DI fell below plus 20 it wouldn't have much impact on the markets. "Capital spending remains solid, and while corporate profit forecasts are slightly weaker for big manufacturers, they are based on a projection of a higher yen. "The survey doesn't point to risks of economic slowdown." HIROSHI SHIRAISHI, ECONOMIST, LEHMAN BROTHERS JAPAN "It's within the range of expectations, and there's nothing particularly surprising. Basically, sentiment of large firms is holding up at high levels. "The expectations index normally points downward when the index is as high as it is now. The fact that expectations pointed downward is not surprising. "The data on the smaller firms looks a little bit softer. But if you look at the capex plans for this financial year, it's fairly solid. The employment indexes were also positive, suggesting corporates are finding the size of the labor force small. "It doesn't change the picture too much. The Japanese economy is on a medium-term upward trend, but there could be some cyclical weakness in coming quarters. But fundamentally, the corporate sector is fairly healthy." MARKET REACTION: - The yen  JPY=  edged a tad weaker against the dollar right after the data but later recovered to stand near 117.65 from around 117.75 just before tankan's release. - The Nikkei share average  .N225  opens up 0.34 percent at 17,346.25 after the softer tankan. - Benchmark September euroyen futures JEYv1 ticked up to 99.225 after the tankan from 99.220 before the data was released.

A positive number means optimists outnumber pessimists. - Market traders were watching the data for clues on the timing of the BOJ's next interest rate hike, although many expect the central bank to stay put when it holds the next policy board meeting on April 9-10. - The central bank lifted its key overnight call rate target by a quarter percentage point to a decade-high 0.5 percent in February, after having raised rates in July for the first time in six years. It kept rates on hold at subsequent meeting in March. - Japan's economy is experiencing its longest growth cycle in the postwar era, albeit at much slower pace than previous booms. It expanded an annualized 5.5 percent in October-December thanks to brisk capital spending and an upturn in personal consumption.
