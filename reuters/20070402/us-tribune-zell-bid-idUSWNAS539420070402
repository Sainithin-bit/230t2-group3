 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Tribune Co. TRB.N said on Monday it agreed to an $8.2 billion bid by Chicago real estate magnate Sam Zell to take the company private, and it plans to sell the Chicago Cubs after the 2007 baseball season. 

 The $34-per-share offer is structured as an employee stock ownership plan, with Zell investing only $315 million and the rest funded by debt. The per-share price was the same as a bid by Los Angeles billionaires Eli Broad and Ron Burkle. The board can consider other proposals until shareholders approve the deal, said Tribune. The company's roster of properties includes television stations and leading U.S. newspapers such as the Los Angeles Times, Chicago Tribune and The Sun in Baltimore. Breaking the Zell deal would cost Tribune $25 million -- a low fee that raises the possibility of a counterbid by Broad and Burkle. Their representatives were not available for comment. The outcome is the result of Tribune's six-month attempt to find a buyer after its largest shareholder, the Chandler Trusts, pressed for a sale to boost flagging share prices. But erosion in newspaper ad sales and falling circulation brought on by the Internet, as well as U.S. rules prohibiting one company from owning too many properties in particular markets, kept some potential buyers away. The Zell offer was somewhat lower than what analysts initially thought Tribune could fetch. "It turns out this is a little lower than I would have thought, but times are what they are. It's like selling your house. Last week it was worth 'X' -- this week it's not," said Benchmark Co. analyst Ed Atorino. The price is about 6.5 times Tribune's forecast 2007 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, according to Reuters Estimates. By comparison, Gannett Co. Inc. ( GCI.N ), the largest U.S. publisher, is trading at a multiple of nearly six times. The Chandlers, which own about 15 percent of the Chicago-based company, support the Zell deal, a spokesman said. Ariel Capital Management, Tribune's fourth-largest shareholder with a 6 percent stake, also supports the deal. "These are clearly challenging times for all newspaper companies, but we are very pleased by today's announcement and plan to support the proposed transaction," said Ariel Capital Vice Chairman Charlie Bobrinskoy. What remains unclear is Zell's motivation in investing in a struggling -- some say dying -- industry. Zell is known as "the grave dancer" after snapping up property at a time when the U.S. commercial real estate market was on its knees, suffering from rampant foreclosures and a lending drought. He has said his interest is in the economics of Tribune, not journalism. Zell has refused repeated requests for an interview. TWO-STAGE DEAL Under the deal, Tribune would be privately held with an employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) holding all outstanding common stock, and Zell holding a subordinated note and a warrant entitling him to buy 40 percent of Tribune's common stock. The two-stage transaction first includes a cash tender offer for about 126 million shares at $34 apiece, funded by borrowings, and a $250 million investment from Zell to be completed in the second quarter of 2007. The second stage would cover the remaining publicly held shares and an additional $65 million investment by Zell, which Tribune expects to close in the fourth quarter. Any successful buyer would have to deal with the roughly $5 billion in debt that Tribune has on its balance sheet, according to its annual report filed on February 26. Tribune said it plans to sell the Chicago Cubs and the company's 25 percent interest in Comcast SportsNet Chicago to help pay down debt. The sale of the Cubs, which analysts have said could attract bids topping $700 million, is subject to the approval of Major League Baseball. The deal is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter, Tribune said. Zell would become chairman, Tribune said. Tribune Chairman, President and Chief Executive Dennis FitzSimons would remain a member of the board, along with at least five independent directors and an additional director affiliated with Zell. In afternoon trading, Tribune was up 74 cents or 2.3 percent at $32.85. (Additional reporting by  Yinka Adegoke ,  Ilaina Jonas  and  Tiffany Wu  in New York and  Jessica Hall  in Philadelphia)
