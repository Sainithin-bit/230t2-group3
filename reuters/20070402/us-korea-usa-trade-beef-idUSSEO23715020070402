 SEOUL  (Reuters) - South Korea and the United States have agreed on Monday to phase out a 40 percent tariff on U.S. beef imports over 15 years. 

 Washington had demanded the immediate removal of all import tariffs on its beef. "Import tariffs on U.S. beef will be eliminated over the next 15 years, step by step," Minister for Trade Kim Hyun-Chong told a news conference. "South Korea will also begin review of beef imports after OIE decision in May on U.S. beef." The World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) said on Friday in a preliminary ruling that the United States is a "controlled risk" country for mad cow disease. A final decision from the OIE is expected in May. Seoul had rejected entire shipments of U.S. beef after finding bone chips as small as coffee beans, since it announced in September it would reopen its market to U.S. beef. Once the No. 3 export market for U.S. beef, South Korea agreed to accept boneless beef from cattle less than 30 months of age if packers removed the brains, spinal cords and nervous tissue most likely to carry the infective agent for mad cow disease. "The loss from the free trade pact would be less than we had expected as South Korea has 15 years to scrap its tariff on U.S. beef, far longer than the period sought by Washington," said Choi Sei-kyun, senior director of the Korea Rural Economic Institute. Last year, the institute had expected the free trade pact would result in beef production losses of around 220 billion won a year if the 40 percent import duties on beef were scrapped in 5 years. "The South Korean beef industry would be the biggest loser from the pact. But lifting the tariff on U.S. beef imports would not cause a collapse of the market for local beef," Choi said.
