 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank President William Poole said on Monday he would lean toward a further rate increase should inflation fail to come down and if the economy was only moderately weak. 

 "If the inflation rate stays up at the current rate and is not converging down toward 2 (percent), then it would be a high hurdle for me to be cutting rates if the economy is only marginally on the weak side," he said in response to a question after a speech to a U.S. economists' group. "I won't be leading the pack in cutting rates" in that situation, he said. The Fed has left interest rates steady for the past six meetings. Poole is a voting member of the Fed's rate-setting committee this year.
