 SYDNEY  (Reuters) - Australian credit checking company Veda Advantage Ltd. VEA.AX on Monday approved a slightly higher A$814 million ($656 million) buyout offer from a private equity consortium, lifting its shares over 7 percent. 

 Veda's biggest shareholder Allco Equity Partners Ltd. AEP.AX, which has a 17.3 percent stake, has agreed to support the deal subject to a significant change in market conditions and in the absence of a superior offer. Still, concerns may loom over the eventual success of the transaction with several institutional shareholders protesting a raft of recent private equity buyouts. "There has been a stronger resolve on the side of the institutions not to giving away companies cheaply," said Neil Boyd-Clark, a portfolio manager with ABN AMRO Asset Management, which owns about 6.2 percent stake in Veda. A Macquarie Bank Ltd. MBL.AX-led bid group are facing opposition to a $8.7 billion offer for Qantas Airways Ltd. ( QAN.AX ) while Archer Capital last month narrowly escaped not being turned down by shareholders in an effort to take control of Rebel Sport Ltd. REB.AX. Veda shares rose as much as 7.6 percent to A$3.53, in a lower overall market .AXJO, but were still trading below the offer price of A$3.61 suggesting investors were not expecting a higher offer or a rival bid. "We are pleased to see that an offer is being made at price higher than initially mooted. We will have a look at our position," Neil Boyd-Clarke said. "It's at a sort of level that we would think is reasonable," he added. The consortium, comprising Pacific Equity Partners and Merrill Lynch Global Private Equity MER.N, raised the offer price by 1.7 percent to A$3.61 each, valuing Veda at A$963 million on an enterprise value basis, Veda said in a statement. The enterprise value includes a net debt of A$149.2 million. Veda's price-to-earnings (PE) ratio at the offered price works out to 23.2, far above the average of the 200 companies in the benchmark S&P/AXJ 200 Index .AXJO which is about 14.5. The independent directors of Veda unanimously endorsed the proposal and recommended that Veda shareholders vote in favor of the transaction. The offer price is A$0.06 more than the consortium's indicative offer of A$3.55 in January. Both the indicative price and the recommended offer price exclude an interim dividend offered last month. Pacific Equity Partners Managing Director, Anthony Kerwick, said the due diligence process had reinforced the consortium's view that Veda Advantage is a high quality business that would perform well under private equity ownership. Veda last year changed its name from Baycorp Advantage. The group was created in 2001 by the merger of New Zealand's Baycorp and Australia's Data Advantage. The Baycorp brand was sold last year along with the Baycorp Advantage Collections Services debt collection business to Trans-Tasman Collections, a consortium including Allco Equity Partners and DB Capital Partners in June last year. Allco would reap a profit after a tax of over A$40 million from its two-year investment in Veda if the deal goes through, Allco said in a statement. ($1=A$1.24)
