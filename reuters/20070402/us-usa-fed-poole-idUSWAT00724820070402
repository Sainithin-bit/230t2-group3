 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President William Poole said on Monday the U.S. central bank's main concern remains inflation and he could be inclined to raise interest rates if price pressures did not abate. 

 He said, however, that he expected inflation to moderate gradually and that the economic outlook could be stronger or weaker than the current outlook. "Inflation is a major concern and if inflation were to head up in a convincing way from the current level, I could be in favor of a rate increase at some point," he told the New York chapter of the National Association for Business Economics, after a speech on inflation. He reiterated in his speech that his personal inflation objective would be 1.5 percent, plus or minus 0.5 percent, as measured by the nonfood, non-energy price index for personal consumption expenditures. Core PCE, minus food and energy, was 2.4 percent higher in March than a year earlier. "The speech is slightly hawkish in reiterating his preference for a 1-1/2 percent centerpoint of a target range for core inflation," said economists in a research note by Goldman Sachs. The Fed has left benchmark overnight interest rates unchanged for the past six meetings after 17 consecutive quarter-percentage-point increases up until June 2006. Poole is a voting member of the Fed's rate-setting committee this year. Poole said in the speech that the economy was fundamentally sound, but later said recent softness in business investment was something of a puzzle and a surprise. "My concern is capital spending may be an indication of some reduced optimism about demand going forward," he said. However, Poole said data released on Monday showing sluggish factory activity was still consistent with the current U.S. growth outlook of about 3 percent. The Institute of Supply Management said factory activity barely grew in March and came in at a slower rate than in February. It was also a little below analysts' forecasts. "It's not evidence of gangbusters growth nor that growth is falling out of bed," he said. "It's consistent with GDP growth of about 3 percent," a reference to gross domestic product. POLICY RULES In his speech, Poole said a clear monetary policy rule provides a central bank with a powerful tool in its quest for sustainable growth and low unemployment. "Focus on monetary policy regimes and policy rules as the instrument of policy, not the near-term choice of the federal funds rate target," he said. "If the (Federal Open Market) Committee communicates its objectives and strategy in a transparent and credible fashion, the bond market and other forward-looking financial markets will amplify the Committee's near-term decisions and thereby do a good deal of its work for it," he said. Poole repeated his preference for adopting an inflation target. The Fed is pondering whether it should adopt a target, as part of a wider assessment of its communication strategy. Poole declined to say how the talks were progressing. The Fed left the benchmark overnight federal funds rate unchanged at 5.25 percent at its last policy meeting in March. But it removed from its policy statement an explicit reference to additional firming of rates, creating flexibility for a rate cut if U.S. economic growth weakened unexpectedly. However, the Fed also left its anti-inflation policy bias intact by stressing inflation remained its predominant concern -- a sign that borrowing costs were not heading down soon. Noting the difficulty of crafting a clear statement, Poole said that Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke was perhaps more clear-cut than his predecessor. "Chairman Greenspan often wrote with the expectation that people would read between the lines," he said. "Chairman Bernanke is trying very hard to have people read the lines and not draw implications from reading between the lines." (Additional reporting by  Alister Bull  in Washington)
