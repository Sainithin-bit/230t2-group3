 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Del Monte Foods Co. DLM.N said on Monday that an arbitration ruling is expected to negatively impact fiscal 2007 earnings per share from continuing operations by about 2 cents. 

 Cash flow will be negatively impacted by about $6 million, the food producer said. Under the arbitration ruling, Del Monte will be required to reimburse Pacer Global Logistics, the company's former logistics services provider, for line haul and fuel charge costs incurred on behalf of Del Monte from May 1, 2005 to April 30, 2006 above contractually-set benchmarked rates, plus interest. Del Monte said the impact was not included in a forecast given last month of fiscal 2007 earnings per share to range between 50 cents and 53 cents and cash flow between $150 million and $170 million. Shares of Del Monte closed at $11.28 on the New York Stock Exchange.
