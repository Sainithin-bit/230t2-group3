 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Texas power company TXU Corp. TXU.N, which in February agreed to a $32 billion takeover by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. and Texas Pacific Group, said on Monday that it did not expect a superior bid. 

 TXU said it had not received any competing offers and that its financial adviser, Lazard Ltd. ( LAZ.N ), had told the independent board committee reviewing the takeover that it did not believe the company would receive a superior proposal to the KKR and TPG bid. The investor group said it would pay $69.25 per share for TXU, which owns a utility, power generation and electricity transmission and distribution assets. In morning New York Stock Exchange trade, TXU shares were down 25 cents at $63.85. The power company said it had contacted more than 70 potential buyers as part of a 50-day "go-shop" agreement with its buyers, which allows it to pursue alternative transactions. The go-shop expires on April 16. TXU said it had signed confidentiality agreements with nine groups of potential buyers in addition to KKR and TPG, but had received no formal offer yet. It said there was no indication that these groups were preparing a bid that would be higher or more likely to close than the agreed-upon offer. There has been some uncertainty about the deal's closing as local politicians, citing concerns about rising retail power prices, have fought for more oversight of the sales process. Texas regulators have proposed a six-month period to review power company sales and mergers, which could push the TXU deal's close to late in the year. The Texas Senate has already passed a bill to give the Public Utility Commission expanded authority to review the transaction, and a similar bill is under consideration in the Texas House of Representatives. Under current rules, an acquiring company is not required to report a sale to the PUC until 30 days after the deal closes. KKR officials told Texas legislators they planned to file the required notice by April 25, well before the second half of the year, when they expect the deal to close, to try to dissuade lawmakers from giving the PUC expanded authority. STILL OPEN FOR OFFERS The company said it was still open to competing proposals and would continue to work with its advisers to determine if there are possible superior offers. The deal with KKR-Texas Pacific has a $375 million break-up fee if TXU accepts a competing bid before April 16. After that, the fee rises to $1 billion. TXU said it had solicited interest from domestic and foreign utilities, other energy companies, private equity investors and infrastructure funds. A source familiar with the situation has said that a team of investors that includes private equity firms Blackstone Group, Carlyle Group and Riverstone Holdings was mulling a rival offer for the company. Despite the low break-up fee and a decision by TXU management to remain free for other buyers by not signing employment contracts with KKR or TPG, sources familiar with the deal have said since it was announced that mounting a competing bid would be difficult. Among the hurdles they cited were the size of the financing for the deal, which is worth about $44 billion including debt, and that KKR and Texas Pacific had laid the groundwork with the environmentalists, promising to scale back to three coal-based power plants from a total of 11.
