 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - AirTran Holdings Inc. AAI.N, parent 
of low-cost airline AirTran Airways, said on Monday it 
increased its hostile offer for Midwest Air Group Inc. MEH.A 
to $15 per Midwest share, or about $389 million. 

  It is the second time AirTran has increased its bid for 
Midwest, which has said it prefers to remain independent. 
AirTran originally offered to buy Midwest for $11.25 per share.  A spokeswoman for Midwest said the airline would consider 
the new offer.  The bid now consists of $9 in cash and 0.5842 shares of 
AirTran common stock for each Midwest share.  "We firmly believe in the underlying value and benefits of 
combining these companies," AirTran Chief Executive Joe Leonard 
said in a statement.  "We are presenting this substantially enhanced offer now in 
order to give their board and management time to consider it 
and enter into discussions with us prior to Midwest's May 23, 
2007, annual meeting," he said.  The offer represents a premium of 83 percent over the 
30-day average closing price of Midwest common stock prior to 
AirTran's initial proposal.  The offer is about 65 percent higher than the closing price 
of Midwest stock on December 12, the day before AirTran 
disclosed its initial proposal. The original bid was made on 
October 20 but not disclosed until December 13.  AirTran said its new offer will expire May 16.  "The board will evaluate the new offer with the help of its 
advisers and investment bankers and make a recommendation to 
shareholders," said Midwest spokeswoman Carol Skornicka.  She said the board will make its recommendation by April 13 
and requests that shareholders not take action before then.  The airline industry is recovering from a slump of several 
years that pushed some carriers into bankruptcy. Experts had 
predicted airline mergers, but many now say consolidation is 
unlikely if carriers can survive without it.  Shares of AirTran were down 4 cents at $10.23 in midday 
trade on the New York Stock Exchange. Midwest shares were up 89 
cents at $14.40 on the American Stock Exchange.
