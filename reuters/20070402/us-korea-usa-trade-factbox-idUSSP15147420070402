 (Reuters) - South Korea and the United States agreed to a trade deal on Monday, after two missed deadlines and months of talks. Studies estimate the deal could add some $20 billion to the countries' current annual $71.5 billion in trade. 

 Here is an overview of other deals in negotiation in Asia and around the world. MALAYSIA: - In February 2007 Malaysia and the United States ended their fifth round of faltering talks on a deal which could double their $44 billion flow of two-way trade. - Neither side has much hope of a speedy solution given Washington's desire for Malaysia to open up government contracts to U.S. firms -- a move which would contravene its politically sensitive affirmative action policies. THAILAND: - Talks that began in 2004 are likely to remain suspended because of Thailand's September 2006 coup. In November 2006, Assistant U.S. Trade Representative Barbara Weisel said talks would not resume until a democratic government was in place. - The United States is Thailand's second-biggest source of direct foreign investment, with $21 billion invested by more than 600 companies. ANDEAN: - Three Andean nations -- Colombia, Peru, and Ecuador -- began negotiations with the United States in May 2004. Deals were completed with Peru in April 2006, and Colombia in November 2006. - No date has been set for resuming March 2006 negotiations with Ecuador; and the November 2006 presidential election, won by Rafael Correa with pledges to limit foreign debt payments, challenge the political oligarchy, and oppose the U.S. free trade deal, could slow progress. UNITED ARAB EMIRATES (UAE): - Formal free trade negotiations began on March 12, 2005, but fell off track in 2006, damaged by a furor over state-owned Dubai Ports World's purchase of certain U.S. port operations. - Trade between the UAE and the United States amounted to $10 billion in 2005, making the UAE the third-largest U.S. trading partner in the Middle East behind Israel and Saudi Arabia. FTAA: - A proposed Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA), taking in 34 democracies, has stalled since being mooted in December 1994. - The plan would have united most of North, Central and South America into the world's largest trade bloc, but Latin American countries like Chile, Peru and Colombia are now gaining access to U.S. markets through bilateral agreements. SOUTH AFRICAN CUSTOMS UNION: - Little progress has been made since the five member countries of the Southern African Customs Union (SACU) -- Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia, South Africa and Swaziland -- launched FTA negotiations with the United States on June 2, 2003. - SACU says it cannot meet intellectual property, government procurement and investment criteria. It has called for greater flexibility given the different economic and development levels of the five member countries, a concession the U.S. has rejected.
