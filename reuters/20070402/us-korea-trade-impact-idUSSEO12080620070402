 (Reuters) - South Korea and the United States on Monday agreed a trade pact after nine months of negotiations. 

 Following are how key South Korean industries are likely to be affected. AUTO MAKERS Lower tariffs could help improve returns at auto makers such as Hyundai Motor Co. and Kia Motors Corp.KS> from the key U.S. market, with auto parts makers such as Hyundai Autonet also expected to benefit. However, auto makers could face increased competition from U.S. imports, as well as U.S.-made cars by Japanese auto makers. TECHNOLOGY SECTOR No major impact is expected given that memory chip makers such as Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd. have not suffered excessively from U.S. duties while running overseas plants for exports. But TV set, mobile phone and parts makers could gain from lower taxes, while firms reliant on imports of U.S.-made parts, non-memory chips and machinery could also benefit. PHARMACEUTICAL SECTOR Smaller drug makers such as Daewoong Pharmaceutical Co. that rely on sales of generic drugs are expected to see the bigger impact from opening up the domestic market, with bigger pharmaceuticals firms such as Dong-ah Pharmaceutical Co. seen less hit. But over the long-term, restructuring and consolidation in reaction to U.S. imports could help raise competitiveness. -- FINANCIAL SECTOR The FTA deal is not expected to have a big impact because the sector, including insurance, has already been opened to foreign competition to a great extent, while ownership ceilings in certain areas apply to both foreign and domestic participants. - AGRICULTURE The free trade pact with the United States is expected to cause South Korean agricultural output to fall by 1-2 trillion won a year, according to the Korea Rural Economic Institute. The total output of South Korea's agricultural sector stands at 35-36 trillion won a year. The institute had said the free trade would result in beef production looses of less than 220 billion won a year when the 40 percent import duties on beef are scrapped in 15 years.
