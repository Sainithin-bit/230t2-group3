 HOUSTON  (Reuters) - The federal judge presiding over the U.S. government's civil fraud case against Texas billionaire Allen Stanford has been recused because a relative has "substantial holdings" managed by the Stanford Group Co, according to a court filing on Friday. 

 The case, which had been overseen by U.S. District Judge Reed O'Connor, will be reassigned. "As litigation progresses, the relative's conduct and holdings are likely to be affected by and subject to further orders of the court," putting the judge's impartiality in question, said an order signed by U.S. District Judge Sam Lindsay. Stanford, some of his companies and two top executives were charged by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday with falsely marketing $8 billion in high-yield certificates of deposit as safe, all the while secretly placing client funds in illiquid private equity and real estate holdings.
