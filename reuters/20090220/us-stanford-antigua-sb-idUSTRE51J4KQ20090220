 ST. JOHN'S (Reuters) - Antigua and Barbuda appointed a receiver on Friday to take control of the bank and a trust company operated by Texas billionaire Allen Stanford in the Caribbean nation, authorities said. 

 An official statement said agents from the receiver were "currently on site in Antigua to take control of the entities," which it named as Stanford International Bank Ltd and Stanford Trust Company Ltd. (Editing by Lisa Von Ahn)
