 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Bank of America Corp ( BAC.N ) Chief Executive Kenneth Lewis was subpoenaed last week by New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo, who is investigating whether the bank broke the law by not telling shareholders about big Merrill Lynch losses, a person familiar with the situation said on Friday. 

 State investigators are probing whether trading losses were adequately disclosed to shareholders, who were asked to approve the deal in December, and to the boards of both companies. Cuomo also is asking what top executives who approved the bonuses knew about the losses, the source said. In a related development, Cuomo's office took testimony from former Merrill CEO John Thain in an all-day session on Thursday, the source said. Thain was asked about $4 billion in bonuses paid to Merrill employees and why Bank of America's merger agreement with Merrill contained a secret attachment outlining the maximum Merrill could pay, the source said. News that Merrill paid bonuses, despite nearly collapsing this year and posting $15.3 billion in fourth-quarter losses, sparked outrage among investors and government officials. Merrill awarded bonuses in December, a month earlier than it did in past years and just before the deal with Bank of America closed. Cuomo's office declined to comment. Bank of America and a Thain spokesman did not immediately return calls. Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America acquired the nation's largest brokerage on January 1. Two weeks later, Bank of America revealed that Merrill lost $15.3 billion in the fourth quarter and announced a second U.S. government capital infusion of $20 billion. Bank of America shares dropped 14 percent to $3.93 on Thursday amid fears that losses from Merrill, credit card-related problems, recently acquired mortgage lender Countrywide Financial and other areas could lead to a takeover by the U.S. government.
