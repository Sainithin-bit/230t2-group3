 HOUSTON  (Reuters) - Stanford Financial Group's customer accounts are frozen until legal claims can be sorted out, and customers can't cash out their holdings at this time, the company's federally-appointed receiver said on Friday. 

 "Customers may not transfer their accounts to another firm or access cash at this time," according to a statement posted on the receiver's website. (Reporting by  Chris Baltimore ; Editing by  Bernard Orr )
