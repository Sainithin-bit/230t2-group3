 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. consumer prices rose in January, advancing for the first time since July as energy costs rebounded, government data showed on Friday, but a severe economic downturn was likely to keep inflation pressures muted in the months ahead. 

 KEY POINTS: * The Labor Department said its closely watched Consumer Price Index rose 0.3 percent after falling 0.8 percent in December. * Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast headline CPI rising 0.3 percent. * Core prices, which exclude food and energy items, rose 0.2 percent after being flat in December. * That compared to analysts' prediction for a 0.1 percent increase. * On a year-over-year basis, consumer prices were flat, the weakest reading since August 1955. The index rose 0.1 percent year-on-year in December. COMMENTS: TERRY MORRIS, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT, SENIOR EQUITY MANAGER, NATIONAL PENN INVESTORS TRUST COMPANY, READING, PENNSYLVANIA: "I guess I would call it a non-event, at least as far as this morning's opening is concerned. It looks like the market is opening on foreign market weakness, which is based on our weakness yesterday. "It did move up, and energy has moved higher while basic materials like gold have firmed up. I don't see it as a bad sign, certainly its counter to deflation, which has been talked about as a risk. I guess if anything, it's good news that it ticked up, not that we love inflation. I think its better that it ticked up and that we're pointing away from deflation." AROOP CHATTERJEE, SENIOR CURRENCY STRATEGIST, BARCLAYS CAPITAL, NEW YORK: "The focus is not so much on deflation at this point. The report wasn't really significant because it didn't really surprise the market. It would have moved the market more had we seen a decline in CPI. But even though the report did not show deflation, it doesn't ease risk aversion in general. The dollar will continue to see safe-haven flows especially with the concerns about the euro zone and eastern Europe ." SCOTT BROWN, CHIEF ECONOMIST, RAYMOND JAMES & ASSOCIATES, ST PETERSBURG, FLORIDA: "Treasuries pared their gains on the increase in the core (CPI), but I think you have to take the January numbers with a grain of salt because a lot of firms will try to pass along annual price increases early in the year. "The main story for Treasuries is a flight to quality and safety, with equities poised to open lower. There are still questions about whether some kind of bank nationalization is coming." JOSEPH TREVISANI, CHIEF MARKET ANALYST, FX SOLUTIONS, SADDLE RIVER, NEW JERSEY: "The numbers are much as expected. You are not going to have much affect on the dollar, on the euro or on equities. This has allayed temporarily fear of heightening deflation." MARKET REACTION: STOCKS: U.S. equity index futures pare losses after CPI/ BONDS: U.S. Treasury debt prices pare gains. DOLLAR: U.S. dollar erases losses vs yen.
