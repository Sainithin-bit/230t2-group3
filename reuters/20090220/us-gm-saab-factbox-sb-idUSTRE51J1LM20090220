 STOCKHOLM  (Reuters) - Following are key facts about Saab Automobile, a wholly-owned subsidiary since 2000 of General Motors Corp which said the Swedish carmaker could file for reorganization as early as this month. 

 * Headquarters: Trollhattan, southwest Sweden. * Financials: 2007 operating loss of 2.19 billion Swedish crowns ($248 million loss), after a 2.90 billion loss in 2006, according to the Swedish Companies Registration Office. Saab Automobile has not made a profit since 2001. (GM does not report Saab financials separately.) * Employees: 4,108 at the end of 2008, of which 3,717 in Trollhattan. 2,059 blue-collar workers are employed at the Trollhattan factory. * Sales: 93,295 vehicles globally in 2008, or 1.1 percent of total GM sales volume, down 25 percent from 2007. * History: Saab has made cars in Trollhattan since 1949. GM bought 50 percent of the firm in 1989 when Saab Automobile was established as an independent company, following a joint venture agreement with Saab-Scania. GM bought the rest of Saab Automobile in January 2000. * Products: Saab's car models 9-5 and 9-3 are built in Trollhattan. Saab 9-3 Cabriolet is made in Magna Steyr in Graz, Austria. GM's current plan is to move production of Saab 9-5 to its Opel factory in Russelheim, Germany, in 2009.
