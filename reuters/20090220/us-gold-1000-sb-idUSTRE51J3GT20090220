 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Safe-haven buying lifted U.S. gold futures to a 7-month high above $1,000 an ounce on Friday, putting the benchmark gold contract within reach of the record high at $1,033.90 hit last April. 

 Owning gold is seen as one of the few ways to preserve wealth during the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. Investors fear the massive U.S. economic stimulus and bank bailout packages will eventually weaken the dollar and cause inflation. They poured money into exchange traded funds and other gold-related assets. Bullion holdings backing New York's SPDR Gold Trust rose nearly five tonnes to a record 1,028.98 tonnes on Thursday. GOLD MARKETS: *COMEX April gold up $21.90 at $998.40 per ounce at 9:08 a.m. EST/ 1408 GMT. *The traded range was $971.50 to $1,000.30, highest price for the active contract since July 16, 2008.. *Spot gold quoted at $995.60/7.20, up from $974.55/975.05 at Thursday's New York close. COMMENTS JEFFREY NICHOLS, MANAGING DIRECTOR, AMERICAN PRECIOUS METALS ADVISORS: "I firmly believe that gold is going much, much higher in the next few years, to levels that many think unimaginable. But markets do not go straight up for long and, when everyone is jumping aboard, watch out for surprises." "The rise in scrap supply along with the decline in fabrication...suggest the price is more vulnerable to a drop off in investment demand, so an easing of investor interest could bring a sizable, though I believe temporary, correction in the yellow metal's price." ZACHARY OXMAN, SENIOR TRADER, WISDOM FINANCIAL, NEWPORT BEACH, CALIFORNIA: "Get used to it ... $1,050, maybe $1,100 an ounce is not out of the realm inside of the next couple of weeks especially if the stock market can put in new lows. "I think what you saw between November and now was just a gigantic bottom bounce in the stock market and now we're hitting the second leg down. This could be the start of a big move in gold. "This is on safe-haven buying. Just wait until we start reinflating from all of this money the government is putting out there. That should fuel it further. GENE MCGILLIAN, ENERGY ANALYST FOR TRADITION ENERGY IN STAMFORD, CONNECTICUT: "All of a sudden the equity market started to turn because some of the concerns about the global economy started to heat up again. Oil has been following that down and gold rallying is a sign that people are worrying about what will happen to the economy." MICHAEL WOOLFOLK, SENIOR CURRENCY STRATEGIST, BANK OF NEW YORK-MELLON, NEW YORK: "It's a direct barometer of risk aversion reaching elevated levels. That's been pushing the dollar higher across the board this morning, too. "Usually the dollar and gold move in opposite directions, but gold has broken out of this trend recently and is moving counter to other commodity prices based on its status as the safe haven of last resort. "While gold is usually an anti-inflationary hedge, it can work as an anti-deflationary hedge, too. As deflation pushes all prices lower, you want to hold something that retains its value. We're watching a technical resistance line around $1,030, and there are better than even odds that we break through that in the next week." LAWRENCE GLAZER, MANAGING PARTNER OF MAYFLOWER ADVISORS IN BOSTON: "I don't think it (gold hitting $1,000) comes as a huge surprise. The gold trade has almost become the consensus among the talking heads. The fact that it has become consensus is almost as troubling as headlines in the financial sector." "People are buying gold for emotional reasons and on worries about bank nationalization in a reactionary move. There are certainly smart people who are buying it and there were a lot of smart people buying oil at $140 too." "Investors need to recognize that gold has no yield. If you bought gold at the wrong time in the 1980s it took you (about 20) years to get your money back." ROBERT MACINTOSH, CHIEF ECONOMIST AT EATON VANCE IN BOSTON: "I think there's a little bit of panic out there. Equities are setting new lows and gold is the place to run to. I don't think there's much more than that. "I think the relative value of gold to stocks is absurd, but your friend is your friend, if you want gold. Until the economy gets some kind of a perceived improvement, you're going to continue to see this. "It won't be long before people realize stocks are very cheap and are going to find profits elsewhere. Gold is 99.9 percent correlated with equities, and as the markets improve you'll see the prices go down." J TAYLOR, EDITOR OF THE INDUSTRY NEWSLETTER, GOLD & ENERGY STOCKS: "Gold can go to infinity because the paper can go to infinity while they are bailing out everyone and his uncle (stimulus package). "Ever since the Lehman Bros failure, gold has bought twice as much oil, three times as much copper, so $1,000 is just a number. It's a psychological level and probably should have gone there a lot earlier. "Gold has been rising more dramatically than people realize. Gold is still very cheap, nobody knows where it's going." PETER BEUTEL, PRESIDENT/ANALYST AT CAMERON HANOVER IN NEW CANAAN CONNECTICUT "People are trying to find something safe and there is a reaction to an inflationary undercurrent as a result of what we need to do in this economy, if there are a lot of dollars printed for the stimulus. "There is no where else anyone feels safe. There were some signs (in inventory data released Thursday) that oil may be stabilizing, at least demand. But this morning crude oil is lower and the market is still looking at the weakness of the economy." TOM BENTZ, SENIOR COMMODITY ANALYST, BNP PARIBAS COMMODITY FUTURES, INC, NEW YORK, NY "Gold at $1,000 an ounce, another sign of the times. "Obviously in these tough times gold is viewed as a physical store of value as opposed to paper currencies." JIM RITTERBUSCH, PRESIDENT, RITTERBUSCH & ASSOCIATES, GALENA, ILLINOIS: "As long as we make new highs in gold, we're seeing further downward pressure on the oil. In the meantime, the equity markets are sliding further south into new low territory so that just paints a bearish picture here for this oil complex. "Plus we got the march WTI (oil contract) expiring today and I think the longs are going to be more on the shorts and that should give us some lower prices." ROB KURZATKOWSKI, FUTURES ANALYST, OPTIONSXPRESS, CHICAGO: "It's a huge psychological level for traders. The fact that traders have become so bullish in gold, just like any index, we probably are looking at some kind of retracement in the future. But it does show that there is enough buying enthusiasm. The traders are definitely acting defensively, now that stock indices are testing November lows.
