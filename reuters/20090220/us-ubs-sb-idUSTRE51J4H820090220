 ZURICH  (Reuters) - No sooner has Marcel Rohner, the chief executive of UBS, put out one fire than another blaze breaks out elsewhere. 

 Only one day after agreeing to a painful, though vital, tax fraud settlement with U.S. authorities, Rohner was hit by a dramatic civil lawsuit against Switzerland's biggest bank that is sending shivers through the entire Swiss banking industry. The ongoing U.S. tax woes, together with an uphill struggle to restructure the crisis-hit bank, make what used to be the pinnacle of any Swiss banker's professional ambition an unenviable poisoned chalice. "This is the last thing he would want," said David Williams, Head of European Banks Research at Fox, Pitt-Kelton. "A difficult task has become even more difficult." Under former, all-powerful chairman Marcel Ospel, UBS, the world's largest wealth manager, waded deep into U.S. subprime assets and was hit in 2008 by a net loss of nearly 20 billion Swiss francs ($16.92 billion), the largest annual loss in Swiss corporate history. Rohner, 44, was named CEO just before the subprime meltdown in June 2007 and was thrown into steering UBS through its monumental crisis. Together with Chairman Peter Kurer, who replaced Ospel in April 2008, he tried to break from the past by announcing a radical restructuring plan in August. Last week, Rohner said net new money had turned positive in both wealth and asset management in January, boosting its shares, briefly. However, there is growing concern in Switzerland that changes are not being implemented fast enough and that a new management team may be needed to start attracting clients again. "Rohner and Kurer are both men of the past. They belong to the management team of Ospel," said Lukas Haessig, a Swiss journalist and the author of investigative book "Der UBS-Crash" (The UBS-Crash). "For a year now they have been trying to turn around the bank and did not succeed in bringing back confidence. Time is running out," said Haessig, whose book came out earlier in February. GENERATIONAL CHANGE Rohner, who has an economics doctorate and had previously led UBS' core wealth management division, became CEO when his long-standing predecessor abruptly resigned. His rise to the top was stellar and a few feathers were ruffled, observers say. Open and laid-back, Rohner, who has spent nearly his entire career at UBS, makes a stark contrast with the sober approach of Kurer, the bank's former general counsel. Rohner, who was deputy CEO and head of UBS's prized wealth management arm, found himself having to scramble for investors' cash in the face of growing writedowns while trying to fend off a damaging U.S. probe into allegations the bank helped Americans hide money to avoid taxes. On the brink of collapse, UBS had to turn to the state for help in October and got a 6 billion franc loan. Pressure on Rohner and Kurer has mounted further since Swiss media started to attack UBS's generous bonus structure at the end of last year in the face of ever-growing losses, prompting top managers to give up or pay back bonuses. "I believe UBS needs new people and a new structure. The bank is far too big for Switzerland, and that poses a threat," said Willy Ruegg, a leader at trade union KV Zuerich, who has been vocal about the need to reform the bank. UBS and Credit Suisse's combined liabilities are around seven times the country's GDP, potentially posing a systemic risk to the country should one of them fail. Speculation about who could take the helm of UBS has been rife since well before Ospel's rushed departure last year. While last time the bank chose to appoint its top team internally, observers say this time around an outsider could take over, signaling a clear break with the past. Fiat CEO and UBS Deputy Chairman Sergio Marchionne, who in the past expressed veiled doubts about Kurer, raised questions about whether Rohner can deliver a turnaround at a January investor meeting, newspaper Cash reported last week, quoting people who attended the event. The name of Deutsche Bank CEO Josef Ackermann, who is Swiss, has been doing the rounds as a possible chairman or CEO, but his own track record with Deutsche Bank is not spotless. The German bank was also hit by the subprime turmoil and lost 3.9 billion euros in 2008. While pressure on the top management remains strong, a change at the top in the middle of the storm might further weaken the battered bank. "A change at the top management and board level right now would be very de-stabilizing for UBS," said Rainer Skierka, a bank analyst with Sarasin. "Also, the question is: who would be the alternative leaders? (Editing by Simon Jessop)
