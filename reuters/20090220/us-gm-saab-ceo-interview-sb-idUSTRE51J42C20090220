 TROLLHATTAN, Sweden  (Reuters) - Saab Automobile's top executive said on Friday several undisclosed companies had expressed interest in General Motors' loss-making Swedish carmaker. 

 "There have been some external companies that have shown interest," Saab Chief Executive Jan-Ake Jonsson told Reuters on the sidelines of a news conference. He declined to comment on who the interested parties were or on how may they were. He also said that creating a separate operation consisting of Saab and German peer Opel, also part of the GM group, had not been discussed in the current reshaping of the firm. "Opel and Saab are an integrated part of General Motors. But to create a separate unit of Opel and Saab has not been discussed," he said. (Reporting by Veronica Ek; writing by  Niklas Pollard )
