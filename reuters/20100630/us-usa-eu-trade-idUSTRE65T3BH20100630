 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The United States has won a landmark victory at the World Trade Organization in a dispute against European government subsidies for aircraft manufacturer Airbus ( EAD.PA ), U.S. trade officials said on Wednesday. 

 "These subsidies have greatly harmed the United States, including causing Boeing ( BA.N ) to lose sales and market share. Today's ruling helps level the competitive playing field with Airbus," U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk said in a statement. (Reporting by  Doug Palmer ; Editing by Paul Simao)
