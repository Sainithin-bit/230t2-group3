 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Oil fell for a third straight day on Wednesday as a rise in U.S. fuel stocks added to anxiety over the strength of oil demand as the market posted its first quarterly decline since the fourth quarter of 2008. 

 U.S. crude for August fell 31 cents, or 0.41 percent, to settle at $75.63 a barrel, seesawing between $74.39 to $76.83. ICE Brent August crude fell 43 cents to settle at $75.01. U.S. oil product contracts led the decline, with the expiring July gasoline futures falling 1.44 cents, or 0.55 percent, to settle at $2.0606 a gallon and July heating oil slipping 3.96 cents, or 1.96 percent, to settle at $1.9817 a gallon. Gasoline stocks unexpectedly rose 537,000 barrels and distillates inventories gained a much larger than forecast 2.46 million barrels in the week to June 25, the U.S. Energy Information Administration reported on Wednesday. Crude oil stocks, however, fell by 2.01 million barrels, more than double expectations. "Even though there is a larger-than-expected draw in crude stocks, we have a build in gasoline, which went against forecasts for a draw, and a very big increase in distillates," said Mark Waggoner, president, Excel Futures in Bend, Oregon. Tuesday's American Petroleum Institute report said crude stocks fell 3.4 million barrels, a smaller decline than the EIA reported, though both reports showed larger stockpile drops than the forecast 900,000 barrels. Crude stocks at the key Cushing, Oklahoma, delivery point for benchmark U.S. crude fell for a second consecutive week, dropping 795,000 barrels, according to the EIA. The recent slip from record high storage at the Cushing hub has helped narrow the price spread between the front-month and near month U.S. crude contracts. The spread narrowed to 53 cents on Wednesday from $1.21 on Tuesday. ALEX TO HIT MEXICO Hurricane Alex helped limit Wednesday's price fall by causing oil companies to shut in 26.3 percent of oil output and 14.4 percent of natural gas production in the Gulf of Mexico despite the fact that it remained on track to make landfall on the Mexican coast, well to the southwest of the main platforms. [ID:nN30246945] [ID:nN30192989] A stronger euro, and weaker dollar, also helped limit oil losses, according to trading sources. The euro strengthened after European banks borrowed less than expected from the European Central Bank, reducing fears they have become too dependent on emergency funding. Down 9.7 percent since the end of March, U.S. crude finished first quarter 2010 down $8.13, its first quarterly price decline since fourth quarter 2008 as stressed financial markets and weak employment limited the pace of recovery. U.S. crude prices hit a 19-month high at $87.15 on May 3, but reverberations from Europe's debt crisis and the tepid pace of growth in top consumers China and the United States pulled oil prices back. Prices fell to $64.24 on May 20, the weakest front-month price since July 2009. Adding to the economic concerns, data from ADP Employer Services on Wednesday showed private employers in the United States added less than a third of the jobs expected in June.
