 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Democratic Representative Barney Frank said on Wednesday that he would revive a proposal to tax banks and other large financial firms that had been stripped from a landmark overhaul of financial regulations. 

 Frank's proposal would move separately from the sweeping financial regulation bill, which the House is expected to approve imminently. "The committee that I chair will, I hope, bring out a bill that revives that assessment," Frank said in debate on the House floor.
