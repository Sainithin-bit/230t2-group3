 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - World stocks closed out a dismal second quarter on Wednesday with a late-day sell-off after Moody's Investors Service Inc. said it may downgrade Spain's AAA credit rating and on persistent worries about global growth. 

 Fresh banking and sovereign debt stress in Europe and growing fears of a "double-dip" recession for the global economy have gripped investors again in June's final days. MSCI's world equity index, which has lost more than 10 percent since April and is down more than 7 percent over the first six months of 2010, dropped 0.66 percent after losing more than 3 percent on Tuesday. The global index has recorded its worst quarter since the final three months of 2008 when the demise of Lehman Brothers sent world markets and the economy into a tailspin. All three major U.S. stock indexes finished Wednesday's session down roughly 1 percent or more. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  slid 96.28 points, or 0.98 percent, to 9,774.02, while the benchmark Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  shed 10.53 points, or 1.01 percent, to 1,030.71. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  lost 25.94 points, or 1.21 percent, to 2,109.24. At the end of the second quarter, Wall Street was in correction mode, with the Dow losing 10 percent in the April through June period, while the S&P 500 shed 12 percent and the Nasdaq also lost 12 percent. Wall Street defines a correction as a drop of 10 percent or more from a recent peak. MOODY'S WARNING ON SPAIN Late Wednesday, Moody's Investors Service said it may cut Spain's Aaa local and foreign currency government bond ratings after a three-month review. Moody's said the possible downgrade reflects deteriorating short-term and long-term economic growth prospects, and the challenges the government faces in achieving its fiscal targets. The rating agency also cited concerns over the impact of rising funding costs over the medium term. That gave investors even more reason to bid farewell to the first half of the year. "The recent market decline reflects a needed dose of skepticism," said Alan Gayle, senior investment strategist at RidgeWorth Investments in Richmond, Virginia, which oversees $63 billion. "We remain cautiously positive on the economy and believe better investment opportunities will develop, but our equity allocations remain closer to neutral over the near term." That sentiment is shared worldwide. Investors are entering the second half of 2010 in a highly cautious mood, taking equity exposure to its lowest level in well over a year and a half, Reuters polls showed on Wednesday. It wasn't all bad news today. The Institute for Supply Management-Chicago Inc said on Wednesday its business barometer fell to 59.1 in June from 59.7 in May, but that was still slightly above economists' expectations. A reading greater than 50 signals expansion. This week, worries that the expiration of some 442 billion euros of one-year emergency ECB loans would leave many strapped European banks with severe financing difficulties eased a little after a replacement 3-month operation saw less of a scramble for funds than feared. "It's definitely a good sign and means there is still some interbank lending occurring within the European money market, and that it's not just a vertical relationship between banks and the ECB," said Gilles Moec, economist at Deutsche Bank. The ECB said 171 banks borrowed 131.9 billion euros ($161.4 billion) over three months at a flat rate of 1 percent -- below expectations for demand of 210 billion euros. The FTSEurofirst 300  .FTEU3  index of top European shares slipped 0.23 percent to close at 993.49 points, a three-week low. The benchmark index ended the torrid quarter with a loss of 7.9 percent, its worst quarterly performance since the first quarter of 2009. ECB relief and slightly higher short-term interest rates due to the week's net drain of emergency funds helped push the euro sharply higher. It rallied almost 1 percent after two days of steep losses, gaining more than 1 percent on sterling. In New York trading, the euro was up 0.44 percent at $1.2233 from a previous session close of $1.2179. NEW QUARTER'S BRUSH WITH THE BEARS The mood remained cautious going into the second half of the year. Looming publication of European bank stress test results next month have added to nerves about the sector. The Bundesbank said on Wednesday that German banks have agreed to participate in EU-wide stress tests once detailed parameters are published. Alongside European banking and sovereign debt jitters and the calendar stresses of the half-year mark, investors are increasingly fearful for global economic growth after a series of downbeat reports from the United States and China. Wednesday data showed U.S. private payroll gains were muted in June, rising just 13,000, as small businesses cut jobs, according to payroll giant ADP. "Markets are very sensitive to any signs that growth is failing," said Bernard McAlinden, investment strategist at NCB Stockbrokers in Dublin. Not coincidentally, investors rushed into their favorite safe haven security, U.S. Treasuries. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note was up 4/32, with the yield at 2.94 percent, while the 30-year U.S. Treasury bond was up 22/32, with the yield at 3.89 percent. But on the short end of the yield curve, the 2-year U.S. Treasury note was down 1/32, with the yield at 0.61 percent. In currencies, the dollar was up against a basket of major trading-partner currencies, with the U.S. Dollar Index .DXY up 0.02 percent at 86.043 from a previous session close of 86.025. The euro was up 0.44 percent at $1.2233 from a previous session close of $1.2179. Against the Japanese yen, the dollar was down 0.16 percent at 88.40 from a previous session close of 88.540. In the energy market, U.S. light sweet crude oil fell 31 cents, or 0.41 percent, to settle at $75.63 per barrel. Other commodities held their own, however. Spot gold prices rose $1.25, or 0.10 percent, to $1,241.70. The Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index .CRB was up 2.25 points, or 0.88 percent, at 258.52. For the second quarter, gold and the dollar gained, while oil and stocks fell. (Additional reporting by  Mike Dolan , Atul Prakash, Kirsten Donovan and Kevin Yao; Editing by  Jan Paschal )
