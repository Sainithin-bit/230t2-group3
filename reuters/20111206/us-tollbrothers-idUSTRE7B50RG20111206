 (Reuters) - Luxury homebuilder Toll Brothers Inc ( TOL.N ) reported higher-than-expected quarterly profit from greater margins, and issued a forecast for new orders that may reflect a bottoming of the U.S. housing market following a long decline. 
 Toll has weathered the U.S. housing collapse, now in its fifth year, better than most U.S. homebuilders because of a sturdy balance sheet and its focus on urban markets, including building condominiums in the New York metropolitan area. Toll executives said three things have worked in the company's favor: young buyers whose unemployment rate is half the national average; families with incomes over $100,000; and wealthy buyers who put down about 30 percent and face lower credit hurdles. Toll said it expects to sell 2,400 to 3,200 homes in fiscal 2012 at an average sale price of $550,000 to $575,000 per home. That projection, which several analysts said was a bit conservative, includes about 170 to 210 homes from its recent CamWest acquisition in the Seattle market. Based on the 7.2 percent increase at the midpoint of the sales forecast, new orders are expected to rise about 2 percent, said Steve Blitz, senior economist at ITG Investment Research. "I think if you look I think it's a signal that things have bottomed," Blitz said. "We're not talking that we're off to the races here. We're talking about healing." For the fiscal fourth quarter ended October 31, Toll earned $15 million, or 9 cents per share. Analysts had expected 5 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. "Overall, we believe these results represent a modest net positive due to the company's modestly better-than-expected gross and operating margins," JPMorgan analyst Michael Rehaut said in a research note. The latest quarter included a $200,000 tax expense. The company, based in Horsham, Pennsylvania, reported earnings of $50.5 million for the year-earlier fourth quarter, which included a net tax benefit of $59.9 million. Revenue rose 6 percent to $427.8 million, topping analysts' average forecast of $422.9 million. Toll closed on the sale of 757 homes in the quarter, up 8 percent from a year ago. Toll shares were up 2.6 percent at $21.28 on Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange, outperforming the benchmark Dow Jones U.S. Home Construction Index .DJUSHB, which rose 1.4 percent. Toll posted gross margins of 23.7 percent, excluding charges, up 2.5 percentage points. Contracts for new homes rose 15 percent to 644, with a value of $390.0 million, up 24 percent. The average price of new homes under contract rose to $606,000 from $565,000 a year earlier, with New York condo sales accounting for part of the increase. On a per-community basis, net signed contracts were 3.04 per community, an improvement of 3 percent from a year earlier but well below the company's historical fourth-quarter average of 5.87. Toll ended the quarter with a backlog of 1,667 homes under order, up 12 percent. The backlog was valued at $981.1 million, up 15 percent. The U.S. Commerce Department last week reported sales that fed hopes that the housing market could at least be bottoming. Sales of new single-family homes in October rose 1.3 percent to a seasonally adjusted 307,000-unit annual rate, the fastest pace in five months. That was still down about 60 percent from its historical norm, Toll said. (Reporting by  Ilaina Jonas ; editing by Gerald E. McCormick, John Wallace and  Matthew Lewis )
