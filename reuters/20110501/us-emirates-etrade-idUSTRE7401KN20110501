 DUBAI  (Reuters) - E*Trade Financial Corp has been fined $200,000 by a regulator in the United Arab Emirates for breaching anti-money laundering controls, the local regulator said on Sunday. 

 Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA), which is the regulator for the Nasdaq Dubai bourse, said it fined E*Trade for failing to obtain sufficient evidence of its clients' source of wealth and for not providing adequate address details for some of its clients. No one at E*Trade could immediately be reached for comment. (Reporting by  Matt Smith ; Editing by Greg Mahlich)
