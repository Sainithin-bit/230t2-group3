 BEIJING  (Reuters) - A Chinese court has jailed a couple for forcing a group of mentally retarded people to work like slaves at a factory in the northwestern region of Xinjiang, the official Xinhua news agency said in a report seen on Sunday. 

 The Tuokexun county court sentenced Li Xinglin to four and a half years in prison on Saturday on charges of violating the labor law, Xinhua said. His wife, Li Yunhua, was given a two-year jail sentence suspended for three years. The two were fined 50,000 yuan ($7,690) each. The husband and wife were convicted of forcing 18 mentally handicapped people to work long hours without pay at their factory which makes construction materials since 2006, Xinhua said. The defendants restricted the workers' freedom and beating them. Last year one worker was accidentally killed, but Li Xinglin did not report the death to police. Incidents of forced labor have shocked China in the past, with slave bosses often preying on the mentally retarded. In 2007, more than 1,000 people were found working as slaves in brick kilns in the northern province of Shanxi, following a man's search for his missing teenaged son. The government launched a nationwide crackdown on enslavement and child labor, but cases are occasionally reported by the media.
