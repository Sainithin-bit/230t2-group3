 (Reuters) - Alabama's Governor Robert Bentley said he was disappointed that Jefferson County on Wednesday decided to file for the largest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history. 
 "I am disappointed by the commission's decision today, as bankruptcy will negatively impact not only the Birmingham region, but also the entire state," Bentley said in a statement. (Reporting by  Matthew Bigg )
