 (Reuters) - BlackBerry maker Research In Motion is investigating reports some users are experiencing delays, but it said on Wednesday that it is not fighting a outage similar to the one that took down its service for four days last month. 
 "We're getting reports that some users are experiencing delays. We're investigating and will update you ASAP," the company said on its official Twitter account. A company spokeswoman later added: "There is no system-wide outage. However we are investigating reports that some users in EMEIA have experienced delays," referring to Europe, the Middle East, India and Africa. Last month, a failure in RIM's unique server architecture, which compresses and encrypts mobile data, cut off email, Internet and messaging service for millions of BlackBerry users across five continents for up to four days. That fault occurred in a facility in England, initially affecting Europe and surrounding regions before spreading to North and South America. RIM's stock fell more than 4 percent to close at $18.05 in regular Nasdaq trade, its lowest close since August 2004. Stock markets generally had sharp declines on Wednesday. The stock has lost two-thirds of its value so far this year. (Reporting by  Alastair Sharp ; editing by Peter Galloway)
