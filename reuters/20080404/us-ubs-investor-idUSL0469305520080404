 ZURICH  (Reuters) - Investor Luqman Arnold said he would increase his stake in UBS AG ( UBSN.VX ) significantly if the Swiss bank adopts his reform proposals calling for a radical shakeup of group structure and management. 

 "If we were convinced that some of our program would be embraced, we think there is very substantial shareholder value to be released and we would want significantly more than today," Arnold told Reuters in an interview on Friday. "We're in this for the medium term," he said. The 0.7 percent stake -- which is an unhedged long position -- gives his investment firm Olivant "enough to have permission to speak." In a letter to management published on Friday, Arnold said he seeks to oust UBS' newly named chairman, sell off asset management and the Brazilian division Pactual, and place the rest into a holding company with a view to selling investment banking and reducing the group to its wealth management rump. Arnold said other investors were beginning to find some interest in his proposals. "We had approached no one before today and now the phones are ringing. We're not saying anything further than that," Arnold said. UBS is preparing for what promises to be another tumultuous shareholder meeting on April 24, when investors will be asked to approve a 15 billion Swiss franc ($14.9 billion) emergency capital hike, the second such hike since February. If a critical mass comes over to Arnold's side, UBS will be forced to consider his request that the bank leave a seat vacant on the board of directors and launch a new search for an external candidate who would potentially then head the group. Arnold opposes UBS' selection of its own in-house lawyer Peter Kurer to replace Marcel Ospel, the incumbent chairman who resigned this week under pressure for failing to prevent UBS' catastrophic venture into U.S. real estate investments.
