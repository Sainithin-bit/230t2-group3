 SEATTLE  (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp ( MSFT.O ) said on Friday a U.S. jury awarded Alcatel-Lucent ( ALUA.PA ) $367.4 million in damages after finding that the company had violated two patents related to the user interface in its Windows operating system. 

 Microsoft, which will seek to have the verdict overturned, said Alcatel-Lucent was seeking $1.5 billion in damages related to the four patents named in the case. Microsoft said the jury found that Microsoft did not infringe on Alcatel's video decoding technology patent. The fourth patent in the lawsuit was asserted only against Dell Inc DELL.O, which was found not to have infringed, according to Microsoft. (Reporting by  Daisuke Wakabayashi ; Editing by  Gary Hill )
