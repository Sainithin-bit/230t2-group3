 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The banks being sued in the Clear Channel Communications Inc ( CCU.N ) case filed counterclaims against the private equity buyers and the U.S. radio operator on Friday, asking a New York state court to dismiss the case against them. 

 They also asked for a declaration from the judge that would cap their liability at $600 million, according to a copy of the filing obtained by Reuters. The $20 billion buyout has been rocked by a dispute between the banks set to finance the deal and the private equity buyers, Thomas H. Lee and Bain Capital. The buyout firms claim the banks balked at providing financing when the debt markets deteriorated and asked for a change in terms of the buyout that prevented it from being completed. The banks were to have earned more than $400 million in fees. "This is just another desperate attempt by the banks to avoid being held accountable for the enormity of the harm caused by their unlawful interference with our merger agreement," Clear Channel said in an e-mailed statement. "We are confident these tactics won't work." A representative for the private equity firms said there was nothing new in the banks' filing. "What remains significant is that the court has agreed to address the matter on an expedited basis, with a trial set to begin in early May," the firms said. "We want to complete the deal to buy Clear Channel, and are looking forward to proving our case that the banks should be forced to live up to the binding commitments they made to finance the transaction." The private equity firms filed complaints in New York and Texas last week against Citigroup Inc ( C.N ), Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ), Credit Suisse Group ( CSGN.VX ), Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc ( RBS.L ), Deutsche Bank AG ( DBKGn.DE ) and Wachovia Corp WB.N to force them to fund a $20 billion buyout of Clear Channel. Clear Channel joined them in the Texas suit, but was not a plaintiff named in the New York case. Justice Helen Freedman said in New York Supreme Court on Thursday that the dispute will go to trial in New York on May 5, or as soon after as can be scheduled. At Thursday's hearing, a lawyer for the banks said they intended to bring Clear Channel into the lawsuit brought against them in New York and planned to file an answer to the suit and counter claims on Friday. The private equity firms are seeking "specific performance" of a commitment letter that details the plans to fund the deal. Specific performance is when one party asks a judge to order another party to stick to a contract. The banks have argued New York courts hold that, except in cases involving real property, a party may not secure specific performance of a contract to lend money. They also argue the letter calls for them to lend money pursuant to documents that are to be negotiated later. They argue the two sides were in talks when the buyers sued. Clear Channel's shares were up 1.9 percent to $28.90 in afternoon trading, still well below the $39.20 the private equity firms are offering.
