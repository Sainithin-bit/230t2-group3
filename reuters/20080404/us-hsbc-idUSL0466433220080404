 MILAN  (Reuters) - The chairman of HSBC Holdings Plc ( HSBA.L )( 0005.HK ), one of the world's biggest banks, said common rules among regulators would help them deal better with crises like the one that had struck banks in recent months. 

 In an interview published in Italian business daily Il Sole 24 Ore on Friday, Stephen Green said the case of Britain's Northern Rock showed how a single regulator was not capable of supervising a bank with international activities. "The lesson from the credit crisis is that supervision by a national regulator is not enough," he was quoted as saying. But Green did not see the need to create a transnational regulatory body to supervise banks whose activities stretch across borders, as suggested by Charlie McCreevy, the European Union's internal market commissioner. "I don't think there is a need for special new law on banks," he said. "I think it is enough that the regulators adopt common policy standards (and) talk periodically to each other about big banks. "This model (already) works and could serve as reference point for the continental banking system." European Union finance ministers and central bankers meet in Slovenia on Friday and Saturday to discuss what regulatory changes are needed in light of the credit crisis. Earlier this week, banks UBS ( UBSN.VX ) and Deutsche Bank ( DBKGn.DE ) took a combined $23 billion hit on their risk assets. Green said the credit crisis was not a failure in corporate governance but errors taken by managers. He said central banks had done a good job in dealing with the crisis but banks had to clear up their accounts without hesitation. Any attempt to find a short cut to the crisis only risked prolonging it, he said. "There are no magic formulas and the quality of a bank's accounts is measured by concrete parameters," he said, citing capital ratios and liquidity. Green also supported the U.S. Federal Reserve's rescue of Bear Stearns BSC.N, a move that Chairman Ben Bernanke had to defend before a Washington committee on Thursday. "It was a responsible move. An inevitable decision," he said. (Reporting by  Gilles Castonguay ; Editing by  David Holmes )
