 ZURICH  (Reuters) - Pressure on beleaguered Swiss bank UBS AG ( UBSN.VX ) intensified on Friday when an activist investor and former chief executive Luqman Arnold demanded to meet UBS' board and shake up its governance and structure. 

 The statement issued by Arnold's investment group Olivant confirms reports in the Financial Times and Wall Street Journal.

"There is an urgent requirement for effective and relevant leadership of UBS's Supervisory Board, the establishment of appropriate corporate governance, forward thinking about future capital needs, a clearer and more focused corporate strategy, a fundamental overhaul of risk discipline, and more open and transparent communication both with the market and internally," Olivant said in a statement.
