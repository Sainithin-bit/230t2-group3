 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co ( JPM.N ), which is taking over rival investment bank Bear Stearns Cos Inc BSC.N, will dominate the management ranks of the combined investment banking and trading businesses, according to an internal memo. 

 Of 26 executives named to executive positions in the investment banking and trading division in a memo from JPMorgan investment bank heads Steve Black and Bill Winters on Friday, only five are from Bear Stearns. The five Bear Stearns executives offered top jobs at the combined bank are Jeff Urwin, co-head of investment banking; fixed income co-heads Jeff Mayer and Craig Overlander; Mike Nierenberg, head of foreign exchange and rates; and Peter Cherasia, head of global technology and operations. The top-level management jobs appointments are the first personnel decisions announced since the banks first reached their agreement to merge on March 16. JPMorgan is by far the bigger bank, with 180,000 employees worldwide, including 26,000 in investment banking and trading. Bear Stearns, the fifth-largest investment bank before it nearly collapsed last month, has 14,000 in all. Still, JPMorgan is mindful it has come under fire for acquiring Bear at a bargain basement $10-a-share as it prepares to slash thousands of jobs. The memo did not discuss the fate of Bear Chief Executive Alan Schwartz. "We recognize this announcement does not include everyone in senior management," Black and Winters wrote. "There are still ongoing discussions with other key leaders on their roles, and more announcements from us will be following shortly once final decisions are made." JPMorgan spokeswoman Kristin Lemkau confirmed the memo, but declined further comment. THE FORTUNATE FIVE The memo also reveals that JPMorgan will reorganize the division, merging investment banking and M&A with debt and equity underwriting. "Putting strategic advice and origination together will enable us to serve clients more holistically, particularly during a time when accessing capital will be both more challenging and more critical," Black and Winters wrote. "Combining teams will also create greater efficiencies as we strive to become more nimble and productive." Morgan's Doug Braunstein will be head of investment banking and origination in the Americas and remains responsible for M&A globally. Bear's Urwin will be head of investment banking coverage in the Americas, while Klaus Diederichs will head banking and underwriting in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Gaby Abdelnour will be CEO of the investment bank's Asia Pacific region across lines of business. Bear's Mayer will become a vice chairman of the investment bank, focused on securities trading globally. Bear's Overlander also was named a vice chairman of the investment bank, focused on investor clients. Morgan's Daniel Pinto will head global emerging markets and run credit trading and syndication, while Carlos Hernandez heads up equities -- prime brokerage, clearing, futures and options. Morgan's Tony Best will run global sales, while Blythe Masters remains commodities chief. Matt Zames will be head of interest rates, foreign exchange and municipal bonds. In the only instance of two banks splitting power, Morgan's Bill King and Bear's Nierenberg will jointly run securitized products and mortgage-backed securities globally. Not surprisingly, JPMorgan, largely unhurt by the credit crunch that hobbled Bear, will also be in charge of risk management. John Hogan will be division chief risk officer, while Brian Sankey will serve as global head of credit risk. In support functions, Bear's Cherasia will manage the division's technology, operations and real estate worldwide. The memo also said business line executives will announce the next level of management decisions by mid-April.
