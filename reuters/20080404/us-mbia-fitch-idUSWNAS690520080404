 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - MBIA Inc ( MBI.N ), the largest bond insurer in the world, said on Friday it disagreed with rating agency Fitch's decision to strip its main unit of top credit ratings. 

 MBIA Chief Financial Officer Chuck Chaplin said in a statement that MBIA has over $17 billion of claims-paying resources and a high quality portfolio, which the company believes will allow the company to "meet severe economic stress scenarios." MBIA said last month it asked Fitch to withdraw its rating on the company's main unit, MBIA Insurance Corp, among others. (Reporting by  Dan Wilchins , editing by Phil Berlowitz)
