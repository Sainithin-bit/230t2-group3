 (Reuters) - Roche Holding AG raised its offer to buy the 44 percent of U.S. biotech group Genentech Inc which it doesn't already own to $93 a share from a previous $86.50 on Friday. 

 All other terms and conditions of the offer, which values the 44 percent stake at $45.7 billion, remain unchanged, Roche said in a statement. Following are key developments in Roche's relationship with Genentech. April 1976 - Genentech -- considered the founder of the biotechnology drugs industry, based on developing genetically modified copies of naturally occurring human proteins -- is founded by venture capitalist Robert Swanson and biochemist Herbert Boyer. February 1990 - Genentech agrees to sell a controlling stake to Roche for $2.1 billion. Under the terms of the deal, Roche would own about 60 percent of Genentech's voting stock. June 1999 - Roche exercises a call option to buy the portion of Genentech it does not own, then reissues up to 19 percent of the stock, preserving the biotech's status as an independently traded company. Roche later makes a further offerings of Genentech shares. July 2008 - Roche offers to acquire all outstanding shares in its U.S. partner Genentech for $43.7 billion in cash to reinforce its position in cancer medicines. August 2008 - Genentech rejects Roche's offer to acquire the outstanding 44 percent, but says it would be willing to consider a sweetened bid. September 2008 - Genentech shares slide below the offer price from Roche as spreading market turmoil stokes uncertainty about the takeover and the scope for an improved bid. January 2009 - Roche turns hostile, cutting the value of its bid to $42 billion, or $86.50 per share in cash. The offer is at a premium of nearly 3 percent to Genentech's closing price the previous day. February 2009 - A special committee of Genentech's board recommends shareholders reject Roche's bid, saying it substantially undervalues the U.S. company. March 2009 - Genentech provides earnings and revenue growth projections for every year through 2018 on March 2 and says its cancer drug Avastin could reach $10 billion in annual sales by 2015, as it aimed to demonstrate that the company is worth far more than Roche is willing to pay for it. -- Roche increases its offer to buy out the 44 percent of Genentech it does not already own, to $93 a share and extends the offer to shareholders by a week. Roche also says that it will proceed quickly to complete all necessary financing.
