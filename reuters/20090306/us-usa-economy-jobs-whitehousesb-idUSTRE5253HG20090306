 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - A top White House economic aide said on Friday no silver lining could be seen in a surge in unemployment in February but that pieces of a recovery plan are in place and the country needs to "power through" hard times. 

 "There's no way that we could or should put a positive spin on these," Christina Romer, chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisers told CNBC, referring to a report that the jobless rate hit 8.1 percent. "The American people are clearly, we're suffering." (Reporting by  Mark Felsenthal ; Editing by Theodore d'Afflisio)
