 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Former U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Richard Breeden said accused swindler Bernard Madoff belongs in prison, and that regulators were lax in their oversight of financial markets and activities of alleged white-collar criminals. 

 Breeden, who ran the SEC from 1989 to 1993 and is now a private investor, in an interview said regulatory shortcomings stem not primarily from deficient rules but from a simple failure to do the job. Investigators have accused Madoff of running a $50 billion Ponzi scheme, and have themselves been faulted for not catching it sooner. Madoff has not been jailed and continues to live in his penthouse apartment on Manhattan's Upper East Side. "No one in government or in the private sector should tolerate someone who thinks it's appropriate to steal $50 billion, and Bernie Madoff should be in the worst prison and not in his apartment," Breeden said. "It may reflect an era in which the SEC was too light in its treatment of the scum who think stealing other people's money is acceptable behavior." Breeden added, though, that Madoff deserves his day in court. Mary Schapiro, the current SEC chairman, on Thursday pledged to improve how the agency handles whistleblower complaints and enforcement tips. U.S. regulators, including the Federal Reserve, have been faulted for turning a blind eye for years to financial excesses, such as the risky mortgage loans that fueled the now-burst bubble in housing and securitization activity. The global financial crisis is widely considered the worst since the Great Depression in the 1930s. "There was a problem principally in bank regulation, of regulators not doing their job," Breeden said. "The Fed sat and watched the housing bubble build for years. There was no lack of information, there was a lack of action. You look at some institutions that have cratered, and both the managements and the boards, and regulators externally, missed opportunities to walk away from the edge of the cliff." Breeden is now a principal at Breeden Capital Management LLC, a Greenwich, Connecticut-based firm that typically invests with a five-year time horizon. He said current economic travails made him recall his grandmother's stories about the Depression, which once "seemed very quaint and very far removed" from modern times. While not identifying specific investments to make now, Breeden said the country will not "dry up and blow away," and the economy will eventually "come roaring" back. "There are some interesting value opportunities, and likely to be more," he said. "It takes a longer perspective, because no one can have confidence that you can call the bottom of the market, or when the turn will come. At the same time, companies are under a lot of stress, and you have to as an investor look hard at cash flow and debt levels, and make sure that companies have the financial strength to ride out turbulent times."
