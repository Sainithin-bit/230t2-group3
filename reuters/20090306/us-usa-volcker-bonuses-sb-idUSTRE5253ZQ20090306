 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Top U.S. presidential adviser Paul Volcker came down hard on Friday on Merrill Lynch executives for taking huge bonuses at a time when their firm was running into irreparable financial trouble. 

 Volcker, a former Federal Reserve chairman, chuckled as he recounted one top Merrill officer's justification for his own very large lump sum payment. "The guy that got the biggest bonus said he deserved it because he played a big role in orchestrating the merger of Royal Bank of Scotland and ABN Amro," he said. "Turns out they were both bankrupt. "What are the incentives? They walked away with $30 million," he said of Merrill's corporate chieftains. Many analysts blame perverse incentives in compensation for the excess risk-taking that has pushed financial markets into their worst crisis in generations. Volcker was speaking at a conference at New York University's business school. (Reporting by  Pedro Nicolaci da Costa ; Editing by Dan Grebler)
