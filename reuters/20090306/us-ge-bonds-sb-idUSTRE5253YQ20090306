 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - General Electric's ( GE.N ) finance arm, General Electric Capital Corp, is offering to buy back up to $1.46 billion in fixed and floating rate bonds, Dow Jones said on Friday. 

 Bonds of GE and its finance arm have plunged in value on concerns over losses the finance unit may suffer from consumer loans. Most of the company's bonds were trading at around 90 cents on the dollar on Friday, though prices varied from between 50 cents and 99.75 cents, according to MarketAxess.
