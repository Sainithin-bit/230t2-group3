 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - American Express Co ( AXP.N ) shares fell below $10 on Friday for the first time in 14 years amid concerns of higher-than-expected credit losses as the economy deteriorates. 

 "This is a consumer led recession, and we haven't had that since the early 1980s. The market is just coming to grips with how weak the loan portfolios are going to perform," said Bill Fitzpatrick, an analyst at Optique Capital Management. American Express U.S. net charge-offs -- a measure of bad loan write-offs -- jumped to 6.5 percent in the fourth quarter from 3.7 percent a year earlier. But analysts said the worst is yet to come, with default rates expected to climb over 10 percent as unemployment rises toward double-digit numbers. American Express fourth-quarter net income tumbled 71 percent due to higher loan losses, lower customer spending and a strengthening U.S. dollar. Analysts have estimated the company could set aside at least $1 billion more to cover bad loans, adding pressure on its earnings. The credit card company, which last year announced plans to cut 7,000 jobs, may slash payrolls further to offset an expected revenue decline of as much as 10 percent as U.S. companies and consumers cut spending, analysts said. "It's very likely American Express will have a loss one quarter or more in the coming year," said Robert Lutts, president and chief investment officer of Cabot Money Management. The pressure on its earnings could force American Express to slash its dividend to preserve capital, analysts said, following in the steps of Wells Fargo & Co ( WFC.N ) and JPMorgan Chase & Co ( JPM.N ). American Express shares slid 4.6 percent at $9.86 on the New York Stock Exchange, after touching $9.71, their lowest price since March 1995. The stock lost almost one-half of its value in 2009, and 77 percent in the last year. (Reporting by  Juan Lagorio , editing by Derek Caney and Jeffrey Benkoe)
