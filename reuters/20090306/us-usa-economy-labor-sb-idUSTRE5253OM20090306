 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The United States will do whatever is necessary to break "the destructive cycle of job loss," Labor Secretary Hilda Solis said Friday after new data showed the U.S. unemployment rate had hit a 25-year high. 

 U.S. employers cut 651,000 jobs in February, according to government data that also showed that a combined 161,000 more jobs were lost in January and December than previously believed. Solis said she was boosting by $3.5 billion the money available to states for education, training and re-employment. (Reporting by  Ross Colvin )
