 (Reuters) - U.S. hedge fund Citadel Investment Group LLC plans to roll out several new funds, including one with lower fees that will aim to make money on currencies, interest rates and other trades based on broad economic trends, the Wall Street Journal reported. 

 Citadel could not be reached for comment. The firm hopes to raise $2 billion in coming months and could raise $5 billion for its new Citadel Global Macro Fund Ltd, the paper said citing marketing documents. Citadel is also preparing to market a fund focused on stocks and another focused on convertible bonds, the Journal said citing people familiar with the matter.
