 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Roche Holding AG raised its offer to buy out Genentech Inc to $93 a share, or $45.7 billion, in a move to clinch the remaining 44 percent stake in the U.S. biotech group. 

 Shares of Genentech jumped more than 10 percent on the news. "Based on conversations with Genentech shareholders, we believe that there is a strong sentiment to bring this process to a conclusion," Chairman Franz Humer said in the statement. Roche is bidding to buy the 44 percent of Genentech it does not already own. ANALYST REACTION CHRISTOPHER RAYMOND, ANALYST FOR ROBERT W BAIRD: "Genentech is widely regarded as the best U.S. biotech company from an R&D and productivity perspective, so there's a bit of an emotional attachment to the company. It won't be a slam dunk, but I give it a 75 percent chance that they get it done at $93. "Some investors will want to hold out (for the April Avastin data), but in this market especially I think there is going to be a lot of people willing to let go of those emotional attachments and say 'OK.'" DAMIEN CONOVER, AN ANALYST AT MORNINGSTAR "I still don't think this will be enough for Genentech shareholders. This is one more chapter in the saga." "I think there has been more support for Genentech since its recent investor meeting, where they laid out a very strong case for a higher value." "The real wild card is the data for Avastin coming up in April. There may be an opportunity for Roche to attract people who are risk-averse and want to get this deal done without looking at the data, but I think most Genentech shareholders will hold out for a higher bid." NICK TURNER, ANALYST AT MIRABAUD SECURITIES IN LONDON: "$93 is a pretty decent premium over what Genentech might be trading at had there not been a Roche takeout offer on the table. As to whether they (Genentech management) would recommend at this level, that's another matter -- it's always been in my mind that management would hold out for $95 and above." JASON KANTOR, ANALYST, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS "This is one of the scenarios we anticipated. Clearly, Roche is eager to get the deal done and so they sweetened the deal." "I don't think that they're going to reach the 90 percent of shares that they need in order to force out the minority holders, so investors can still hold out for a better price. But I think at $93 you're going to see a fair few people tendering their shares." "I think the (Avastin) adjuvant data has always been the source of the timing of this transaction. They've always been trying to consummate the deal prior to the data." GEOFFREY PORGES, ANALYST FOR SANFORD BERNSTEIN: "This is going to be significantly more difficult for minority shareholders to turn down. It's reaching the level that investors have been looking for, and it's a clear signal that Roche is willing to take their offer in the right direction rather than the wrong direction. "In some ways it's an admission of failure from their prior tender strategy of lowering the price and they obviously weren't getting much bite at $86.50. I don't think this a slam dunk at $93, but it's got a much higher probability of success than $86.50. "Given the weakness of healthcare stocks over the past week and obviously of the whole market, getting a firm offer of $93 is going to look pretty tempting to a bunch of those minority shareholders."
