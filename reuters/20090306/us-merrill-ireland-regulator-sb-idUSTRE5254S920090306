 DUBLIN  (Reuters) - Ireland's financial regulator said it was investigating the mispricing of trades at Merrill Lynch and was liaising with regulatory counterparts in the UK and the United States. 

 Merrill Lynch discovered a trading "irregularity" during a recent investigation of the troubled investment bank's London trading positions, the company said earlier on Friday. Ireland's regulator said Merrill Lynch International was regulated by the Irish watchdog. "This issue relates to mispricing of trades at their London branch," a spokeswoman for the regulator said. "We were advised on February 18 of matters relating to this." "We and the UK FSA have agreed the scope of investigations," she said. "We are liaising with the U.S. parent regulators of Bank of America and Merrill." (Reporting by  Jonathan Saul )
