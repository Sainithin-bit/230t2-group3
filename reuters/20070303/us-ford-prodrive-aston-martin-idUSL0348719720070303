 LONDON  (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co. ( F.N ) is in exclusive talks with Prodrive, a motor racing company, over the potential sale of the U.S. carmaker's Aston Martin luxury car unit, The Times said on Saturday. 


 The newspaper quoted unnamed sources as saying Prodrive had trouble financing a bid but Ford had chosen it as the racing group had offered a higher price than other interested buyers. Ford could receive over 450 million pounds ($875 million) for Aston Martin, sources familiar with the situation told Reuters last month. Ford could not immediately be reached for comment.
