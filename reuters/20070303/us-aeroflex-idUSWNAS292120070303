 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Aeroflex Inc. ARXX.O, which makes microelectronics for the telecommunications, aerospace and defense markets, said on Friday it struck a deal to be bought by private equity firms General Atlantic and Francisco Partners for about $1 billion. 


 Aeroflex, based in Plainview, New York, said its stockholders would receive $13.50 a share in cash, which represents a 22.6 percent premium over Friday's closing share price of $11.01. The company said the agreement contains a provision under which Aeroflex, which makes test and measuring devices for various electronics, may solicit alternative proposals from third parties through April 18. It said it would pay a break-up fee if it accepts another offer, but did not disclose the amount. "Following an extensive review of the proposed transaction, our board unanimously concluded that the offer from General Atlantic and Francisco Partners is in the best interests of Aeroflex's stockholders, employees and customers," said Len Borow, Aeroflex's president and chief operating officer, in a statement. The deal is the latest in a run of private equity deals across a range of sectors in the United States. General Atlantic has about $12 billion of capital under management, with recent investments in companies such as Lenovo ( 0992.HK ), NYSE Group Inc. NYX.N and SRA International Inc. SRX.N. Technology-focused Francisco Partners has about $5 billion of committed capital under its management. (Reporting by Rakesh Sharma in Bangalore,  Bill Rigby  in New York; editing by Carol Bishopric)
