 BERLIN  (Reuters) - Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti said on Wednesday he shared sympathy for the notion cultivated by German authorities to further integrate and share a greater part of states' sovereignty within the European Union. 
 "It is so much better to voluntarily share sovereignty in the context of the Union than to have to commit a country to a less voluntary decision-making by others," Monti said in a speech. (Reporting by  Stephen Brown , writing by Annika Breidthardt)
