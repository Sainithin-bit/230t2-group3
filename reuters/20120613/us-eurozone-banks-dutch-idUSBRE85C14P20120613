 AMSTERDAM  (Reuters) - A banking union in Europe is currently not a solution to Europe's debt crisis but would be a long-term project, Dutch Finance Minister Jan Kees de Jager told parliament on Wednesday. 
 "It is clear that a good construction of a banking union, including rules on banks' exposure to governments, is very difficult. In my view, a banking union is a long-term project, not a solution now for the debt crisis," De Jager said in a parliamentary debate on the provision of aid for Spain's banks.
