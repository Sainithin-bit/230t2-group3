 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Dallas Federal Reserve Bank President Richard Fisher said on Wednesday fiscal policy is critical in providing a spark for the U.S. economy. 

 "Monetary policy accommodative techniques are necessary but insufficient to the task," Fisher said in a symposium hosted by a private think tank in Tokyo. Fisher is not a voting member on the Fed's policy-setting committee this year. (Reporting by  Leika Kihara )
