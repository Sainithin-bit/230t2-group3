 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Sharp Corp ( 6753.T ), the world's third-largest LCD TV maker, said its loss will double for the business year just ended from its previous estimate, hit by restructuring costs and sliding LCD panel prices. 

 Sharp now expects to post an operating loss of 60 billion yen ($599 million). That is double an estimate in February of a loss of 30 billion yen and compares with a consensus of a 37.3 billion yen loss in a poll of 21 analysts by Reuters Estimates. (Reporting by  Kiyoshi Takenaka )
