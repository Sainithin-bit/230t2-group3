 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Dallas Federal Reserve Bank President Richard Fisher said on Wednesday he would not comment on whether the U.S. dollar's recent rises against other currencies would be short-lived. 

 "No central bank official and no finance ministry official should ever comment on the direction of currencies," Fisher said in a symposium hosted by a private think tank in Tokyo. Fisher is not a voting member on the Fed's policy-setting committee this year. (Reporting by  Leika Kihara )
