 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Shares of U.S. life insurance companies rose broadly on Wednesday on a report that the government may widen a funding program for troubled financial companies to include insurers. 

 The U.S. Treasury is expected to announce within the next several days the inclusion of life insurers that are bank holding companies or own a thrift in its capital injection program, The Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter. Shares of Hartford Financial Services Group Inc ( HIG.N ) climbed more than 30 percent to as much as $11.35 in early morning trading, from $8.45 on Tuesday. Prudential Financial Inc ( PRU.N ) shares climbed more than 12 percent to touch $25.30 from $22.10, and MetLife Inc ( MET.N ) rose more than 10 percent to reach $26.98 from $24.16. The broader Dow Jones U.S. life insurance was up as much as 12.7 percent. "We look forward to the official word from Treasury," said a spokesman for the American Council of Life Insurance. Hartford Financial was not immediately available for comment. Treasury officials and a Prudential spokesman declined to comment. In recent months, some insurance companies have received approval to acquire banks, paving the way for them to participate in the government's Troubled Asset Relief Program. "TARP could be a source of relatively cheap capital, but (it) is not critical for most life insurers," analysts at UBS wrote in a research report on Wednesday. "It likely will temporarily boost investor confidence, but TARP funds alone cannot eliminate the capital/liquidity pressures caused by weak credit, equity market and economic conditions," the analysts added, noting TARP funds have not proved a "cure-all" for other recipients. In January, bank regulators approved applications from Hartford and Lincoln National Corp ( LNC.N ) to become savings and loan holding companies, which is needed for them to be considered for federal funds.
