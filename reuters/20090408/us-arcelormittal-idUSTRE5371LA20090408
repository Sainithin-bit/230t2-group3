 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - ArcelorMittal ( ISPA.AS ), the world's largest steelmaker, was meeting unions on Wednesday to discuss temporary production cuts at its plants across Europe. 

 Senior management and the European works council were present at the meeting that began in the morning in Luxembourg, the company said. It declined to say whether further production cuts would be required. The company has cut production globally by up to 45 percent in a bid to accelerate inventory reduction. The sector has been hard hit by the slump of its key auto and construction markets. (Reporting by  Philip Blenkinsop ; editing by  Mark John )
