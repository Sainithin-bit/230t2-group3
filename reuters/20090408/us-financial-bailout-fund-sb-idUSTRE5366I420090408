 (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury Department estimates that it has $134.5 billion remaining in the $700 billion financial rescue fund approved by Congress in October. 

 Treasury officials say the estimate includes an assumption that $25 billion in capital provided to banks will be returned, a projection Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner has called "very conservative." Following is an outline of funds spent or pledged from the bailout fund so far: -- An unspecified amount pledged to recapitalize the nation's largest banks, as needed, under the Capital Assistance Program after regulators conclude a series of "stress tests" to determine capital needs. -- The Treasury said it would use $75 billion to $100 billion to seed its public-private plan to buy up to $500 billion worth of toxic assets. Officials say the figure includes $25 billion to expand the Federal Reserve's Term-Asset Backed Loan Facility, or TALF, to cover so-called legacy assets. -- The Treasury estimates that it will provide $218 billion in capital to banks under its original Capital Purchase Program, which was initially eyed at $250 billion. The latest transaction report shows the Treasury had completed equity purchases totaling $198.5 billion under this program. -- $50 billion pledged for mortgage foreclosure mitigation. -- $20 billion investment in Citigroup as part of a package in which the government agreed to share in losses on $301 billion of assets. In addition, the Treasury has disbursed $5 billion as part of its second-loss guarantee. The $20 billion is in addition to $25 billion disbursed as part of the Capital Purchase Program. -- $20 billion investment in Bank of America as part of a package in which the government agreed to share in losses on $118 billion of assets. In addition, the Treasury has pledged to cover up to $7.5 billion in potential losses as part of a second-loss guarantee. The $20 billion is in addition to $25 billion disbursed earlier as part of the Capital Purchase Program. -- $40 billion investment in troubled insurer American International Group. In addition, the Treasury has said it stands ready to provide up to $30 billion more. -- $25 billion has been disbursed to prop up the U.S. auto industry, according to the latest transactions report, and a further $5 billion has been pledged to assist auto suppliers. -- $20 billion has been shifted to a special purpose vehicle to cover potential losses on $200 billion in lending under the Fed's TALF. Treasury officials say they intend to provide an additional $35 billion to enlarge this program for lending against recently originated securities. When considered in conjunction with the $25 billion being set aside to expand TALF to cover older securities, the Treasury has said it intends to commit $80 billion to TALF. -- $15 billion pledged to purchase securities backed by Small Business Administration loans.
