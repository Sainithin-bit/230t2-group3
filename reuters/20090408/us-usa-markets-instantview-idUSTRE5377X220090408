 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Federal Reserve policy makers agreed in their March 17-18 meeting that "substantial additional purchases" of a range of longer-term assets was appropriate to deal with a steep drop in economic activity across all sectors, minutes of the meeting showed on Wednesday. 

 KEY POINTS: * FOMC minutes show Fed felt U.S. economy was deteriorating, foreign activity softening * FOMC felt inflation to stay muted, might persist below desirable levels * Fed saw downside risks high; rising jobless rate, output to cause financial sector losses * Fed said financial markets little changed from January, still "extraordinarily stressed" * Minutes said some signs Jan-Feb consumer spending stabilizing, strained by falling stock, home prices * FOMC members agreed substantial purchases of a range of longer-term assets appropriate * Some FOMC members favored "very substantial" rise in asset purchases, others more modest purchases COMMENTS: CHRIS RUPKEY, CHIEF FINANCIAL ECONOMIST, BANK OF TOKYO-MITSUBISHI UFJ, NEW YORK: "We're trying to figure out why they pulled the trigger and bought substantial quantities of Treasuries, that is $300 billion of so-called longer term Treasuries. "It looks like they were concerned about the very weak economic outlook. "The one interesting thing is one of the reasons they may have held back on the amounts of Treasuries and agencies and mortgage backed securities that they were going to buy is they felt that the TALF asset expansion of the balance sheet could be quite substantial. That's a little bit interesting because TALF at the moment is going nowhere. it's shrinking not accelerating. "If I had to guess looking at this statement today they are going to renew this program of $300 billion longer Treasury securities six months from now. I would say they will just have to continue it six months from now." OMER ESINER, FOREX MARKET ANALYST, RUESCH INTERNATIONAL, WASHINGTON: "There was surprisingly little mention about quantitative easing. If anything, I think the dollar could firm on the downgrades to both growth and inflation and the resulting rise in risk aversion in the market." ROBERT BRUSCA, CHIEF ECONOMIST, FACT AND OPINION ECONOMICS, NEW YORK: "The assessment of the economy is very bad. This is clearly a big problem that they are worried about. They have their actions in place. It doesn't look like they have anything else imminent at this point. "The most discouraging thing is the wording they used to describe the domestic and overseas economies, which is very bad. I don't see any language here resembling the 'green shoots' used by Bernanke." DAVE ROVELLI, MANAGING DIRECTOR, US EQUITY TRADING, CANACCORD ADAMS, NEW YORK: "The markets are selling off on it; they lowered estimates on the GDP number and said a lot of private firms aren't participating in the TALF program like we wanted to see. "The only positive is that they lowered their estimates on inflation. But that's the sort of thing where we can lower them now, but if we recover, inflation is going to be an issue. You can't put this much money into something and not worry about it later on."
