 TORONTO  (Reuters) - Canada's Alimentation Couche-Tard ( ATDb.TO ) offered $1.85 billion for Casey's General Stores ( CASY.O ) on Friday in a move to  expand its presence in the United States, but the target company rejected the offer as opportunistic. 

 The $36-a-share bid by Couche-Tard, Canada's largest convenience store operator, is expected to draw rival bids from private equity funds for Ankeny, Iowa-based Casey's. Couche-Tard, which already has 3,600 stores in the United States, said it would take its offer directly to Casey's shareholders if the board failed to reconsider its rejection. The offer price represented a 14 percent premium over Casey's Thursday closing price of $31.59 on Nasdaq. Shares of Casey's, which has about 1,500 convenience stores in the Midwest, rose 24 percent to $39.17 on Friday, suggesting investors expect a higher offer to eventually emerge. Couche-Tard shares were up 1.1 pct at C$18.40 on the Toronto Stock Exchange. The bid "is too low a price and there is not enough of a premium over where the stock has traded in recent history," said Todd Vingers, a money manager at Lee Munder Capital in Boston, which owns 1.3 percent of Casey's. "As a take-out it is definitely worth more than the $36 bid." Vingers said he could see deep-pocketed private equity firms stepping up with superior offers. "You could potentially see private equity with an LBO -- those are other strategic options besides these guys," he said, referring to the possibility of a leveraged buyout. "I'm not sure there are a lot of strategic buyers." Brent Rystrom, an analyst at Feltl and Co in Minneapolis, Minnesota, said Couche-Tard would have to sweeten its offer substantially if it wants to compete with private equity players. "We believe it is likely Casey's could find a private equity buyer in this range," he wrote in a note. "Alimentation might have to make an offer in excess of $41 to actually close a deal." Couche-Tard, which has grown steadily through acquisitions over the years, has made no secret that it is on the prowl for more deals in the United States. It told analysts that it was looking for another big buy similar to its $804 million purchase of the Circle K chain, which it closed in 2003. Casey's operates convenience stores and gasoline filling stations in the Midwest under the Casey's General Store, HandiMart and Just Diesel banners. Couche-Tard operates 3,600 convenience stores in the United States under the Circle K banner and more than 5,400 under the Mac's name in Canada. It threatened to take the bid directly to Casey's shareholders if its board refuses to co-operate. "If you continue to refuse to engage in meaningful negotiations, we are prepared to submit our proposal directly to your shareholders and commence a proxy contest to replace your board of directors," Alain Bouchard, Couche-Tard, president and chief executive, said in a letter to Casey's board. Casey's board appeared determined to put up a fight, however. "We believe the timing of your proposal is very opportunistic, given the impact of the recession and recent severe weather within our marketing territory," Casey's president and chief executive, Robert Myers, said in a letter. "The 14 percent premium of your proposal to our closing stock price yesterday, underscores that you are attempting to acquire U.S. companies on the cheap."
