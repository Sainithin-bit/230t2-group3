 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Aetna Inc ( AET.N ) is suspending marketing to and enrollment of new members to its Medicare plans for the elderly because of sanctions imposed by the U.S. government, the health insurer said on Friday. 

 Aetna, whose shares fell 3 percent, said the suspension was effective April 21. It affects Aetna's Medicare Advantage and standalone prescription drug plans, but does not affect its current Medicare enrollees. Aetna said the sanctions relate to compliance with requirements involving Medicare prescription drug plans, primarily tied to changes in the drugs covered by some plans from 2009 to 2010. Medicare is the U.S. government health plan for the elderly. The No. 3 U.S. health insurer said it is cooperating with the U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, and is working to resolve the issues. "Compliance problems are unacceptable to Aetna; the issues raised to us by CMS have our utmost attention," Aetna President Mark Bertolini said. Aetna shares fell 3 percent to $32.65 in premarket trading. (Reporting by  Lewis Krauskopf , editing by Gerald E. McCormick)
