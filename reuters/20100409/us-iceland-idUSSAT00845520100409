 STOCKHOLM  (Reuters) - The Icelandic government expects the crisis-hit island nation to receive aid payments from the Nordic countries as well as the IMF if the fund's board gives the go ahead, an official said on Friday. 

 Earlier on Friday, the International Monetary Fund said it had signed a letter of intent for a second review of Iceland's aid program, which has been held up due to a long-running dispute over Icelandic debts to Britain and the Netherlands. "If the IMF board accepts the review there would then be no obstacle for the loan from the IMF or the Nordic countries to be let through," Icelandic Finance Ministry official Indridi Thorlaksson told Reuters.
