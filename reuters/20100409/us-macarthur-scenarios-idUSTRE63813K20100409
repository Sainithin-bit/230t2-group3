 SYDNEY  (Reuters) - Australia's Macarthur Coal MCC.AX, the world's leading exporter of cleaner, pulverized coal used in steelmaking, is a company in demand. 

 The miner has this week rejected two bids of nearly $3.5 billion, and is seeking to go ahead with an alternative plan to make an acquisition of its own. Macarthur has spurned a $3.45 billion offer from New Hope ( NHC.AX ) and an earlier $3.3 billion offer from Peabody Energy ( BTU.N ), the world's largest private-sector coal producer. Instead, Macarthur is pursuing an agreed deal under which it would take over smaller Gloucester Coal GCL.AX and hand a 25 percent stake in itself to commodity trader Noble Group ( NOBG.SI ). Time is short. Macarthur shareholders are due to vote on Monday on the Gloucester/Noble deal. Key to the outcome are Macarthur's three big shareholders -- China's CITIC Resources Holdings ( 1205.HK ) and steel giants ArcelorMittal SA ( ISPA.AS ) and South Korea's POSCO ( 005490.KS ) -- who hold a combined 47.3 percent. What's next in this complex, fast-paced takeover battle? A BETTER OFFER Quietly, this may be what Macarthur is hoping for. While it has said Monday's vote will go ahead, it added that it could delay the meeting if there were "material change to circumstances." That could leave the door ajar for potential suitors -- from Peabody to New Hope, or others such as Xstrata XTA.L -- to come up with a knockout punch. "Macarthur is saying 'come up with a real offer," said Tom Elliot, managing director at hedge fund MM&E Capital said. "They are signaling the current offers are not enough. The market is expecting A$16. What's on the table is far from it." The Australia Financial Review, in an unsourced report, said coal giant Xstrata XTA.L had approached ArcelorMittal and POSCO about a possible bid. With Asia's insatiable hunger for resources, more bidders could yet come in for Macarthur and its prized coal reserves. Analysts reckon Macarthur's minority shareholders would probably agree to an offer closer to A$16 a share. Peabody has offered A$14. MACARTHUR PUSHES AHEAD WITH GLOUCESTER VOTE A clear possibility if potential suitors refuse to blink. "Macarthur must have a tacit understanding with its key shareholders for the vote unless a much sweeter offer comes through," said one analyst, who did not want to be named as his firm is involved in the deal. Less than A$20 a share would crystallize a loss for ArcelorMittal and POSCO, who bought into Macarthur at the 2008 market peak, so they are unlikely to sell at current levels, even if they were to get other benefits from a deal. SHAREHOLDERS VOTE, REJECT GLOUCESTER DEAL Unlikely. If any of the big shareholders appears to be backing away, Macarthur can quickly call off the vote and try to attract a higher offer. The assumption is that it has done its homework. (Editing by  Ian Geoghegan )
