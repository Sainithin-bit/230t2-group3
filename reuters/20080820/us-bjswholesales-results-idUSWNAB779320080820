 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - BJ's Wholesale Club Inc BJ.N said on Wednesday its quarterly profit rose as shoppers headed to the No. 3 U.S. warehouse club operator in search of low prices on food and fuel. 

 Profit for the second quarter that ended Aug 2 was $36.5 million, or 61 cents per share, compared with $36.27 million, or 55 cents per share, a year earlier. (Reporting by  Nicole Maestri ; Editing by  Derek Caney )
