 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - One year after the first alarm bells of the subprime mortgage crisis rang on Wall Street, many of its victims are trading at half their value or less, while others have long been buried. 

 On February 8, 2007, HSBC ( HSBA.L ) said it would take a charge of about $10.6 billion on subprime loans. The evening before, the No. 2 U.S. subprime lender, New Century Financial Corp NEWCQ.PK, had unexpectedly warned it faced a quarterly loss and said it would restate previous earnings. New Century shares lost more than a third of their value on February 8, but to look at the overall market, there was no telling how big a toll the crisis would take on the U.S. stock market. The S&P 500 shed less than 2 points that day. By spring, the stocks of subprime lenders were falling into a death spiral and dropped from the major exchanges in steady succession. On April 2, New Century filed for bankruptcy protection. American Home Mortgage Investment Corp AHM.N followed in August. Accredited Home Lenders Holding Co LEND.O was bought out by a private equity firm in October. Countrywide Financial Corp CFC.N, the nation's No. 1 lender, hit a high of $44.92 on February 7, 2007. The shares are now trading at $6.58 as it awaits a takeover by Bank of America Corp ( BAC.N ). But despite the bloodbath in the mortgage finance sector, investors last autumn were still confident enough that the subprime debacle was contained that they pushed both the Dow and S&P 500 to lifetime highs on October 11. From its intraday high on October 11 to Friday's close, the S&P 500 index has fallen 15.5 percent. "That's been the history of the last year. Denial, denial denial," said Gary Shilling, president of A. Gary Shilling & Co., an investment research firm in Springfield, New Jersey. "That's what held stock up in October. That confidence was shaken shortly after, when Merrill Lynch warned it would have to write down billions of dollars more in subprime-related debt than it had previously said. Citigroup, Bear Stearns and others added to the writedown chorus. In a year, Merrill Lynch MER.N has fallen nearly 45 percent. Citigroup ( C.N ) stock has fallen more than 52 percent and Bear Stearns has shed nearly 51 percent. In addition to millions in market capitalization, all three firms have lost their chief executives. By New Year, consensus formed that the subprime crisis would indeed spread beyond the mortgage and financial market and into the broader economy, and potentially beyond U.S. borders. "More recently people realized the theory of decoupling was a fairytale, that the U.S. really is the world's economic leader," Shilling said. "There's still a lot of denial. The consensus is begrudgingly admitting we're into or close to recession, but the consensus is now that it will be over in the first half of the year." Wall Street may have been late to recognize the impact of the subprime crisis, but the public caught on fast. Less than a year after HSBC and New Century fired their warning flares, the television show "Law and Order" featured a plot about a con-artist who scammed subprime mortgage holders facing foreclosure to sign over their homes.
