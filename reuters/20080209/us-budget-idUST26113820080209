 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Canadian Finance Minister Jim Flaherty expects to have his budget ready by the first week of March and is eager to prove his fiscal prudence to voters before they go to the polls. 

 The two-year old minority Conservative government has stoked talk of an early election by threatening confidence votes over the next few weeks on issues such as the country's Afghan mission and crime legislation. In an interview with Reuters on Saturday, Flaherty said he wants to bring down his budget before a vote takes place. "I realize we're going to have more challenging economic times -- we already are -- this year but that's a good opportunity for a Conservative government to show that we can manage fiscally in rough waters," Flaherty told Reuters in an interview prior to a G7 meeting in Tokyo. "I'd like to do the budget ... I don't want an election before the budget. I'd like to continue until October 2009." He said he expected to have the budget written by the first week of March but would not say when he would present it to Parliament. There is widespread speculation in Canada that it might be sooner, on February 26. After introducing corporate and personal tax cuts last October, Flaherty has lowered expectations for more stimulus in his third federal budget. On Wednesday, he said he intended to proceed with a $10 billion (C$10 billion) debt paydown next month rather than pump more stimulus into the economy.
