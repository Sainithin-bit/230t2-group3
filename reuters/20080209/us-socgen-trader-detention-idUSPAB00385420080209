 PARIS  (Reuters) - A French court ordered on Friday that Jerome Kerviel, the trader accused of causing a 4.9 billion euro loss to Societe Generale, be detained during judges' investigation of rogue trading at the bank. 

 Kerviel has been placed under formal investigation for abuse of trust and other charges. The Paris appeals court ruled that Kerviel should be detained because of the "necessities of the investigation" and the risk that Kerviel could flee abroad.
