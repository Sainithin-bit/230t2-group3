 LONDON  (Reuters) - U.S. private equity firm Blackstone ( BX.N ) is considering a fresh bid for British engineer FKI FKI.L, the Independent newspaper said on Saturday. 

 The paper, without citing sources, said FKI had invited Blackstone in for talks after receiving a bid proposal of 70 pence a share, or about 412 million pounds ($803 million), from rival Melrose NYN.L. Blackstone was behind an aborted 130-pence-a-share bid proposal for FKI last summer, the Independent said. Neither Blackstone nor FKI could immediately be reached for comment.
