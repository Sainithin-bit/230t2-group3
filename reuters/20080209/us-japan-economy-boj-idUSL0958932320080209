 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japan may propose a plan to parliament as soon as February 15 to promote Bank of Japan Deputy Governor Toshiro Muto as the head of the bank to succeed Toshihiko Fukui, whose term expires on March 19, a Japanese newspaper reported on Saturday. 

 The Yomiuri newspaper, without citing sources, also said the government may submit a plan to appoint Masaaki Shirakawa, a former BOJ director, as a vice governor of the central bank. The government was making final adjustments to submit to the plan by next week, the paper said. The appointment of the new BOJ chief needs the consent of both chambers of parliament and could be blocked by opposition parties, which took control of the upper house in an election last July. The main opposition Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ), whose endorsement would ensure the smooth appointment of a new central bank chief, has said it wants the government to propose several candidates for the post. Ichiro Ozawa, the head of DPJ, said he has not received any proposal from the government and believed nothing was decided at the moment. Ozawa told reporters after a party meeting in Chiba, near Tokyo, on Saturday. Ozawa declined to comment further about the BOJ personnel, adding his party did not have the authorization to make an appointment. The Democrats had opposed the appointment of Muto, a former finance ministry bureaucrat, as deputy governor back in 2003, as they wanted to end the practice of retired bureaucrats landing jobs associated with their former posts. Yet, Muto, whose term as deputy BOJ governor also expires on March 19, is considered by analysts to be the leading contender to succeed Fukui. Keisuke Tsumura, a Democrat lawmaker, told Reuters in an interview on Friday that Japan's main opposition party should -- and probably will -- support the promotion of Muto to BOJ governor. Tsumura, one of the few lawmakers who has worked for the central bank, said he discussed the issue with top party leaders. Politicians should not play a leading role in the selection process and should instead respect market expectations, he said. (Reporting by  Chikafumi Hodo  and Yuko Yoshikawa)
