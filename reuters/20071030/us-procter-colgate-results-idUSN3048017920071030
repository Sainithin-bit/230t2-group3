 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Household and personal care products leader Procter & Gamble Co ( PG.N ) and smaller rival Colgate-Palmolive Co ( CL.N ) both posted double-digit quarterly profit increases on Tuesday, but P&G's shares fell as its full-year outlook disappointed analysts. 

 Colgate shares rallied as its earnings beat analysts' estimates, helped by strong growth in Latin America and increased global market share of toothpaste and manual toothbrushes. "Colgate is looking into next year and reiterating guidance and P&G is only one quarter into their (fiscal year) and already they are hedging their guidance," said William Chappell, analyst at SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. P&G said commodity costs will force it to raise prices more, while Colgate said its cost savings programs were offsetting rising commodity prices, he added. The weaker dollar and strength in emerging markets helped lift both companies' earnings, while price hikes helped mitigate the impact of soaring costs for resin, coffee and other raw materials. AN UP YEAR FOR P&G Shares of P&G, stock of which has been up 17.4 percent since the end of June, fell nearly 4 percent as its full-year forecast, excluding a one-time tax benefit, remained unchanged. P&G had a "strong quarter with organic growth in-line with estimates, but we don't believe this is the quarter that changes the market's opinion on Procter's long-term growth prospects," April Scee, an analyst at Banc of America Securities, said in a research note. P&G, the maker of Pampers diapers, Tide laundry detergent and Gillette razors, said profit was $3.08 billion, or 92 cents a share, in the fiscal first quarter that ended September 30, compared with $2.70 billion, or 79 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding a one-time tax benefit, earnings were 90 cents a share, in line with analysts' average forecast, according to Reuters Estimates. Sales rose 8 percent to $20.20 billion. Organic sales -- which exclude acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange -- increased 5 percent during the quarter. Sales in the highly competitive beauty care segment rose only 6 percent, with half the increase due to the weaker dollar. P&G said it expects earnings of $3.46 a share to $3.49 a share in fiscal 2008, raising its forecast range by 2 cents to account for the tax benefit. Sales are expected to increase 6 percent to 8 percent, with currency accounting for about 3 percentage points, the company said. Analysts on average have forecast $3.47 before the tax benefit. COLGATE, OTHERS ALSO UP Colgate, the maker of its namesake toothpaste, Mennen deodorant and Hill's Science Diet pet food, said profit was $420.1 million, or 77 cents a share, for its third quarter, compared with $344.1 million, or 63 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding restructuring costs and pension charges, earnings were 86 cents a share. Analysts, on average, were expecting 85 cents. Third-quarter sales rose 12 percent to $3.53 billion. Sales in Latin America rose 16 percent, while sales in Asia and Africa rose 18.5 percent. Colgate is about three years into a four-year restructuring program aimed at focusing its business on oral care, personal care and pet food, with savings helping boost spending on marketing. The company said it was confident it could post double-digit earnings per share growth in the rest of 2007 and in 2008. Among other household product and personal-care companies, Avon Products Inc ( AVP.N ) posted a 61 percent profit increase and earnings in-line with analysts expectations. The direct seller of cosmetics said sales grew 14 percent and its stock rose almost 4 percent. Energizer Holdings Inc ( ENR.N ), which makes batteries and Schick razors and recently acquired Playtex Products, had a 54 percent quarterly profit increase, but its stock fell 7 percent as earnings missed analysts' estimates. P&G shares were down $2.78 to $69.05 late in the session on the New York Stock Exchange and Colgate shares were up $1.94 to $76.20. At Monday's close, P&G traded at 20.7 times estimated 2008 earnings per share, compared with a multiple of 19.9 for Colgate.
