 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. Steel Corp ( X.N ) posted a 35 percent decline in third-quarter profit on Tuesday, worse than Wall Street had expected, and forecast weak fourth-quarter earnings, sending the steelmaker's shares down 7 percent. 

 The company, which had reported a 25-percent profit drop in the second quarter, again cited weaker tubular steel prices as well as declines in European shipments. And the steelmaker said it expects earnings to decline in the fourth quarter because of seasonal effects and some scheduled blast furnace outages in Europe and the United States. Fourth-quarter results for tubular steel are expected to be consistent with third-quarter levels. U.S. Steel shares closed down $7.88, or 7.0 percent, at $104.62 on the New York Stock Exchange. The news weighed on other steel company stocks, and the Dow Jones steel index .DJUSST was down 5.15 percent. Analysts, however, said that despite the weak third-quarter figures and poor fourth-quarter outlook, they were generally bullish on U.S. Steel's picking up momentum next year. "We do not believe this result derails the positive outlook for 2008 and beyond," Credit Suisse analyst David Gagliano wrote in a research note. Analyst Charles Bradford of Bradford Research/Soleil said, "It was very disappointing and the guidance was even worse. Everybody (analysts) had earnings down, but not as bad." But Bradford said the U.S. side of the company's results looked better than Europe, while underlying demand for tubular steel used in oil and gas pipelines and drilling rigs was actually good. Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John Surma told analysts the weakness in tubular steel was partly due to large inventories left over from its $2.1 billion acquisition of Lone Star Technologies, which was near closing, perhaps as early as Wednesday. "The underlying consumption has been good, with drilling and line pipe activity," he said. "Imports from China are a particular concern, but we have observed a slight leveling of imports." Asked about prospects of the steel industry rebounding in 2008, Surma said third-quarter results for flat-rolled steel were "quite good, considering the economy was not going gang-busters. "Imports are trending down and with the (weak) dollar, we are set up for a response in pricing and re-stocking. (However) customers are cautious as they are not seeing where the economy is going." But he said U.S. auto and appliance markets were stable and that U.S. Steel expected to improve its margins on new contracts with the auto industry. On European hot-rolled operations in Serbia and Slovakia, Surma said inventories had been drawn down and with a new galvanizing line due to start up, results would improve in one or two quarters. "The fundamentals are good; it's a little ways out, but not too far away." Third-quarter net earnings were $269 million, or $2.27 per share, compared with $417 million, or $3.42 per share, a year earlier, the Pittsburgh-based company said. Excluding one-time items, earnings were $2.50 per share, falling short of analysts' average forecast of $2.63, according to Reuters Estimates. In July, after reporting lower second-quarter results, Surma had said he expected operating results to improve in the third quarter. In fact, income from operations fell to $360 million $561 million. Net sales rose to $4.35 billion from $4.11 billion. The decrease in European operating earnings to $152 million from $219 million was primarily due to lower shipments as a result of outages and higher raw material and unit costs. Tubular steel profit fell to $74 million from $164 million, due mainly to lower prices and the cost of integrating operations from the Lone Star acquisition. U.S. Steel said it was starting an early retirement program at its Kosice operation in Slovakia. It said the financial impact would not be known until later this year.
