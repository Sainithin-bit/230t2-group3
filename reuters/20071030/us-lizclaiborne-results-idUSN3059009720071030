 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Clothing company Liz Claiborne Inc LIZ.N posted sharply lower quarterly profit on Tuesday, hurt by weak sales in its wholesale brand segment, which includes Ellen Tracy and Dana Buchman. 

 Net income for the fiscal third quarter that ended September 29 was $33.1 million, or 33 cents per share, compared with $95.2 million, or 93 cents per share, a year ago. Excluding restructuring expenses, a loss from the sale of some brands, and an impairment charge, adjusted earnings were 63 cents per share. The company, which is trying to shift its focus from wholesale to retail, put 16 of its brands up for sale in July as part of an overhaul by Chief Executive William McComb. Last month the company said the U.S. arm of Hong Kong-based sourcing and trading company Li & Fung Ltd ( 0494.HK ) agreed to buy four brands. Net sales in the quarter fell 3.9 percent to $1.26 billion, hurt by declines in its "partnered brands" segment. The company lowered its full-year earnings outlook, saying it now expects adjusted earnings of $1.70 to $1.80 per share on net sales projected to be down in the low single digits. In July it had said it was on track to meet its 2007 forecast projecting net sales to be flat to down low single digits, and earnings per share to range from $1.90 to $2. Liz Claiborne, which also said earlier this year it planned to cut up to 800 jobs, has struggled due to a squeeze on moderate apparel brands, falling demand for its traditional upscale brands and lower sales from consolidating department stores that increasingly promote their own private brands.
