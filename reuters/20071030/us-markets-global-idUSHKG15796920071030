 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Stocks fell on Tuesday after disappointing earnings and a report showed that consumer confidence fell to a two-year low, helping to drive the dollar to a record low against the euro as the Federal Reserve began a two-day policy meeting. 

 But U.S. government bond prices slipped after an article in The Wall Street Journal raised doubts that the Fed would cut interest rates again after the central bank's half percentage point cut last month. Oil prices plunged more than $3 from an early session high, part of a broad sell-off in commodity markets that was set off by The Wall Street Journal article. The Journal's Fed watcher, Greg Ip, known for sometimes reflecting the views of senior central bankers, said the housing slump has not been severe enough to alter the Fed's outlook of a return to moderate growth next year. A quarter-point cut is not a sure thing and officials are not seriously considering a half-point cut, he said. "There is some uncertainty about what the Fed will do tomorrow and that is weighing on the market," said Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at Morgan Asset Management in Birmingham, Alabama. "Some earnings disappointments and forward guidance is not encouraging, and there is a feeling that if we don't get help from the Fed, then the fourth quarter and first quarter next year could see even slower economic growth," he added. In stocks, benchmark indexes were mixed. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  was down 26.01 points, or 0.19 percent, at 13,844.25. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  was down 4.79 points, or 0.31 percent, at 1,536.19. The Nasdaq Composite Inde  .IXIC  was up 6.95 points, or 0.25 percent, at 2,824.39. Shares of Merrill Lynch MER.N fell 2.25 percent or 1.52 points to $65.90 after the investment bank ousted Chief Executive Stan O'Neal just days after reporting the biggest quarterly loss in its history. U.S. Steel ( X.N ) posted a 35 percent slide in third-quarter profit, worse than Wall Street expected, and warned of weaker fourth-quarter earnings. Its stock fell 7.3 percent to $104.33. Procter & Gamble ( PG.N ) gave a disappointing outlook even as it reported a higher quarterly profit, and its shares dropped 3.8 percent to $69.09. Home builders' shares also slipped after the Standard & Poor's/Case Shiller index showed prices of single-family homes in August posted the biggest year-over-year decline since 1991. TREASURIES, DOLLAR LITTLE CHANGED The mere hint that the Fed might not cut rates led some analysts to think current U.S. government bond prices might be a bit rich. But losses were slim, with prices underpinned by the Conference Board's report that showed its consumer confidence index fell to 95.6 in October, the lowest reading since the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina two years ago. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note was down 1/32, with the yield at 4.3868 percent. The 2-year U.S. Treasury note  was down 1/32, with the yield at 3.8133 percent. The 30-year U.S. Treasury bond was down 4/32, with the yield at 4.6742 percent. The weak confidence data also weighed on the dollar. Lower U.S. interest rates diminish the appeal of the dollar. The euro edged up 0.1 percent from late Monday, to a high of $1.4441, according to Reuters data. Dealers seemed intent on heading into the meeting with hefty bets against the greenback, expecting the Fed to signal that additional policy easing might be needed to stave off a U.S. economic recession. The dollar index, a gauge of the greenback's value against a basket of major currencies, fell to a low of 76.747 .DXY. While the chance of a half-percentage point rate cut by the Fed on Wednesday has evaporated in the last few weeks, the futures market still reflects expectations for about 40 basis points of policy easing by the end of January 2008. In commodities markets, crude oil futures fell on news that Mexico may reopen shut oil ports and on profit-taking after Monday's rally. U.S. light sweet crude oil fell $3.71, or 3.97 percent, to $89.82 per barrel. Spot gold prices fell $9.35, or 1.18 percent, to $781.65. On Monday, spot gold hit $794.40, the highest since January 1980 when it hit a record high of $850. European stocks extended losses, tracking the decline in U.S. shares. The FTSEurofirst 300 index fell 0.42 percent, or 6.62 points, to 1,581.69. Japan's Nikkei average fell 47.07 points, or 0.28 percent, to end the day at 16,651.01. In contrast, Hong Kong's benchmark Hang Seng Index ended at 31,638.22, its highest-ever close.
