 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Auto parts maker Delphi Corp DPHIQ.PK said on Tuesday the size of its bankruptcy exit financing package would be reduced and several changes made to its reorganization plan due to the roiling credit markets. 

 Delphi, which filed for court protection in October 2005 and expects to depart bankruptcy in the first quarter of next year, said its exit financing package would be reduced by about $1.9 billion. The company also expects modification of a $2.55 billion equity plan led by Appaloosa Management LP, although the investors led by Appaloosa would still acquire $800 million of preferred stock and $175 million of common stock. Those direct investments by the plan investors reflect a much lower assumed enterprise value for Delphi. A $1.575 billion discount rights offering would be open to unsecured creditors and eliminate the participation of current stockholders. The rights offerings would be conducted after the reorganization plan is confirmed by creditors, Delphi said. Shareholders also would not receive a small direct distribution of new shares, but would receive rights to acquire stock at the designated value of the reorganized Delphi and warrants to acquire stock, although the window to exercise the warrants would shrink to six months from five years. The revised plan has been supported by the committee for unsecured creditors and former parent General Motors Corp ( GM.N ), but will not be supported by the equity committee. Delphi also revised its business plan, noting expected changes to the production outlook for GM in North America and its capital structure. Delphi has been divesting businesses and expects revenue to decline in 2008. Under the amended proposal, GM would still recover $2.7 billion, but would no longer receive an all-cash distribution. GM would receive $750 million cash, a $750 million second lien note and $1.2 billion of junior convertible preferred stock. The plan also would eliminate a cash distribution to unsecured creditors. Unsecured creditors still would receive a full recovery with 92.4 percent in common stock and 7.6 percent in participation in the discounted rights offering. Delphi filed its first plan of reorganization with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New York in September, but had delayed completing a review of the plan description in October. The company expects to enter an exit financing agreement with lenders by November 7 and seek court approval later in November. Delphi also plans to seek approval of the amended equity plan on November 8, the date the hearing on its disclosure statement is set to resume. In the meantime, Delphi said it would seek to amend and extend its $4.5 billion of debtor-in-possession financing to June, with the ability to extend it to September. Delphi plans to meet on Tuesday with investors about those plans.
