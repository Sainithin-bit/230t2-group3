 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Sepracor Inc SEPR.O posted lower third-quarter earnings on Tuesday, hurt by soft sales of its respiratory drug Xopenex, and said it would cut its sales force by about 300 positions. 

 The Marlborough, Massachusetts-based drug company posted a net profit of $42.9 million, or 37 cents a share, compared with $64.4 million, or 56 cents a share, a year ago. Sepracor projected the sales force reduction and other cost cutting would lower sales and marketing expenses by $90 million to $100 million next year. (Reporting by  Lewis Krauskopf )
