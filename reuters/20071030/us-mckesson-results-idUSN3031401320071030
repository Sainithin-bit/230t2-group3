 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Pharmaceutical wholesaler McKesson Corp ( MCK.N ) reported on Tuesday that quarterly profit rose a better-than-expected 8 percent, helped by demand for higher profit margin generic drugs, and the company raised its full-year earnings forecast. 

 The company posted a net profit of $247 million, or 83 cents per share, for its fiscal second quarter ended September 30, compared with a profit of $229 million, or 75 cents per share, a year ago. Excluding items, San Francisco-based McKesson earned 82 cents per share from continuing operations. That beat analysts' average expectation of 72 cents per share, excluding items, according to Reuters Estimates. "They had a very good quarter across the board. Our numbers were above the Street, but they even exceeded ours," said Deutsche Bank analyst Barbara Ryan. McKesson shares rose nearly 3 percent in extended trading. Revenue for the quarter rose 9 percent to $24.5 billion, topping Wall Street estimates of $24.1 billion. McKesson said it now expects to earn $3.22 to $3.37 per share for its fiscal year ending March 31, up from its previous forecast of $3.15 to $3.30 per share. The company said it was able to raise its forecast even with two upcoming quarters of marginal dilution from its recently closed acquisition of Oncology Therapeutics Network for $575 million. "It looks like most of the guidance raise is due to a lower tax rate for this quarter and the rest of the year, but it was clearly good," said Eric Coldwell, an analyst for Robert W Baird. McKesson said the tax rate for the year would be 33 percent, down from the 34 percent to 35 percent originally expected, which it said reflects a growing mix of foreign versus domestic income. While acknowledging a more favorable tax rate was a component of the raised forecast, Chief Financial Officer Jeffrey Campbell told analysts on a conference call the company was "expecting a strong fourth quarter." The drug distribution business saw sales rise 9 percent for the quarter with a gross profit of $848 million, helped by sales of generic medicines, which are more profitable than more expensive branded drugs. Deutsche Bank's Ryan said drug distribution had solid growth "despite concerns about some of the weak volumes we saw in July and August." Revenue in the technology solutions unit jumped 36 percent, driven by the acquisition of Per-Se and growth in software and imaging sales to hospitals, clinics and physician offices. Baird's Coldwell said the technology performance was a disappointment as most of the gain came from the Per-Se acquisition. "I think that will have a little bit of a limitation on what the stock does tomorrow, but I still think it will be up fairly impressively," Coldwell said. "It would be up even more if weren't for technology solutions." McKesson shares rose to $60.20 in after-hours electronic trading from the New York Stock Exchange close at $58.55. The company's shares are up about 16 percent for the year, outpacing those of its rivals, Cardinal Health Inc ( CAH.N ) and AmerisourceBergen Corp ( ABC.N ), whose shares are up about 3.6 percent and 2.4 percent, respectively.
