 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Sirius Satellite Radio Inc. ( SIRI.O ) said on Tuesday its quarterly net loss narrowed as revenue jumped on a sharp increase in subscribers to its fee-based service. 

 The third-quarter net loss at Sirius, which expects to close its merger with rival XM Satellite Radio XMSR.O later this year, was $120.1 million, or 8 cents a share, compared with a loss of $162.9 million, or 12 cents a share, a year ago. The company added 524,938 net subscribers in the quarter for a total of 7.7 million. (Reporting by  Franklin Paul , editing by Steve Orlofsky)
