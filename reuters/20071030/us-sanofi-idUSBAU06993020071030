 (Corrects drug name to Ambien CR, from Ambien. Ambien CR is an extended version of Ambien)   

 PARIS  (Reuters) - French pharmaceuticals group Sanofi-Aventis ( SASY.PA ) said on Wednesday that data showed improvements in work performance in patients with chronic insomnia treated with its Ambien CR drug . "Patients with chronic insomnia can have a higher frequency of work-related problems including absenteeism, an increased rate of accidents, difficulty performing duties and less job satisfaction," Sanofi said in a statement. These results, which are part of a larger study to evaluate the efficiency and safety of Ambien CR, were recently presented at the 20th annual U.S. psychiatric and mental health congress in Florida, Sanofi said in a statement. Ambien CR is an extended release formulation of Ambien, with an added indication for sleep maintenance, in addition to sleep induction, a spokeswoman at Sanofi said.
