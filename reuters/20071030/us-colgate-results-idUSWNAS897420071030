 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Colgate-Palmolive Co ( CL.N ) on Tuesday posted higher quarterly profit, helped by strength in emerging markets and improved margins and savings from cost-cutting measures. 

 The maker of Colgate toothpaste, Mennen deodorant and Hill's Science Diet pet food said profit was $420.1 million, or 77 cents a share, for its third quarter, compared with $344.1 million, or 63 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding restructuring costs and pension charges, earnings were 86 cents a share. Colgate is about three years into a four-year restructuring program aimed at focusing its business on oral care, personal care and pet food, with savings helping boost spending on marketing. Colgate shares closed Monday at $74.26 on the New York Stock Exchange. (Reporting by  Nicole Maestri )
