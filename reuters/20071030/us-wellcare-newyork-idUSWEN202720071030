 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - New York State regulators are looking into WellCare Health Plans Inc's ( WCG.N ) activities as they relate to the state's Medicaid program, a person familiar with the investigation said on Tuesday. 

 The regulators are reviewing contracts the insurer has with the New York state Medicaid program, according to the source. It was not clear whether the New York investigation was related to a probe in Florida, which saw more than 200 state and federal agents raid the company's headquarters last Wednesday. A WellCare spokeswoman declined to comment. The news is the latest in a series of legal problems faced by the health insurer, which serves 2.3 million elderly, low- income and other members through the government-sponsored programs Medicare and Medicaid. WellCare revealed on Friday that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission had requested unspecified information a day after the raid. The Connecticut attorney general's office also said it had been conducting a months-long probe, distinct from the Florida investigation, into a WellCare affiliate. Last week's raid in Florida involved agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the U.S. Department of Heath and Human Services Office of the Inspector General and the Florida attorney general's Medicaid Fraud Control unit. WellCare shares have plunged roughly 80 percent since the raid last week. They closed down $6.58, or 23 percent, at $22.04 on the New York Stock Exchange. New York is one of 7 states where WellCare operates Medicaid health plans, according to regulatory filings. (Additional reporting by  Lewis Krauskopf )
