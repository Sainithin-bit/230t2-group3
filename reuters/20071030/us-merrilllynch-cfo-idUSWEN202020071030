 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Merrill Lynch & Co Inc MER.N Chief Financial Officer Jeffrey Edwards offered to resign during the past week, CNBC reported on Tuesday, as the largest U.S. brokerage continues to struggle with the fallout from more than $8 billion of third-quarter write-offs. 

 Merrill's third-quarter loss, driven by exposure to mortgages and other securities that plunged in value this summer, has prompted a shakeout among executives responsible for the breakdown in managing investment and market risks. Chairman and Chief Executive Stanley O'Neal is widely expected to resign, as early as today. Merrill officials were not immediately available for comment. (Reporting by  Joseph A. Giannone )
