 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The Financial Industry Regulatory 
Authority (FINRA), the U.S. brokerage watchdog group, said on 
Monday that seven executives, including officials from Merrill 
Lynch MER.N, Lehman Brothers LEH.N and Pershing LLC, were 
elected to its board of governors. 

  FINRA, created by the merger of NASD and NYSE regulation, 
said securities firms elected Richard Brueckner, Pershing's 
chief executive, Thomas Russo, Lehman Brothers' vice chairman 
and chief legal officer, as well as Robert McCann, who oversees 
Merrill's 16,600 brokers.  W. Dennis Ferguson, executive vice president of Clearing, 
Sterne, Agee & Leach and three other governors were elected by 
the smaller securities firms.  The elections were conducted at the self-regulatory 
agency's first annual meeting last Friday.  Finra's board also includes 11 public governors appointed 
by the former NASD board of governors and the NYSE's board of 
directors.  (Reporting by  Rachelle Younglai )
