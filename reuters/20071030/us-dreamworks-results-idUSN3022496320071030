 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - DreamWorks Animation SKG Inc DWA.N posted sharply higher third-quarter profit on Tuesday, propelled by the international box office performance of the "Shrek the Third" movie. 

 Net income rose to $47 million, or 47 cents per share, from $10.5 million, or 10 cents per share, a year earlier. Revenue jumped to $160.8 million from $55.6 million a year ago. Analysts, on average, expected net earnings of 46 cents per share on revenue of $164.2 million, according to Reuters Estimates. DreamWorks said "Shrek the Third" was again the largest driver of the quarter, contributing about $92.1 million in revenue, primarily from international box-office receipts. To date, the film has generated $793 million in worldwide box office and ranks as the third highest-grossing animated film. "'Shrek the Third' is now one of the most successful animated films of all time and demonstrates that our franchise is one of the strongest in movie history," said Jeffrey Katzenberg, chief executive of DreamWorks Animation. The Glendale, California, company, which is set to release its highly anticipated "Bee Movie" on November 2, will also release the DVD of "Shrek the Third" domestically on November 13. It said it expects the DVD to be a primary revenue driver for the fourth quarter. It said it does not expect to generate significant revenue in the fourth quarter from "Bee Movie" as its distributor will likely not have recouped the upfront marketing and distribution costs. Some analysts are looking for "Bee Movie," which has drawn mixed reviews, to ultimately generate about $181 million to $190 million domestically and the same amount internationally. The third-quarter results also included a $25.8 million benefit from a tax-sharing agreement with a stockholder, which was partially offset by a $22 million increase in the income tax benefit payable to the stockholder. That resulted in an increase to net income of $3.9 million, or 4 cents a share. DreamWorks said its first-ever TV holiday special, "Shrek the Halls," will debut on ABC television on November 28, but said it will not have a material financial impact on fourth-quarter results. Home video sales and pay television and broadcast fees for other library titles, including "Over the Hedge" and "Flushed Away", also accounted for revenue in the third quarter.
