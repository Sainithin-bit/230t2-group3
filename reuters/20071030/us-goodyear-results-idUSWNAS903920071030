 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co GT.N, the largest U.S. tire maker, posted a quarterly profit, supported by a gain on the sale of its engineered products business and a focus on sales of more expensive branded tires. 

 Goodyear reported a net profit of $668 million, or $2.75 per share, for the third quarter, compared with a net loss of $48 million, or 27 cents per share, a year earlier, when it took restructuring and other charges. (Reporting by  David Bailey , editing by Gerald E. McCormick)
