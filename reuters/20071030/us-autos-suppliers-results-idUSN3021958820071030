 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co GT.N, the largest U.S. tire maker, and three U.S. auto parts makers posted profits on Tuesday, and shares of all but one rose. 

 Goodyear and American Axle & Manufacturing Holdings Inc ( AXL.N ) both reported results that topped Wall Street estimates and shares rose as much as 10 percent and 5.7 percent each. TRW Automotive Holdings Corp ( TRW.N ) results disappointed analysts in terms of margins, and its shares dropped 6 percent. Tenneco Inc ( TEN.N ) reported that profit tripled and its shares rose 1 percent. Goodyear said profit more than tripled in its key North American Tire unit, where it has reduced its focus on low profit tires in favor of more expensive branded tires. "We believe that the company's third-quarter earnings announcement will reestablish an upward trend as investors value more fully the structural improvements being made at Goodyear," Calyon Securities analyst Mark Warnsman said in a note. American Axle, which generates about three-quarters of its revenue on business with General Motors Corp ( GM.N ), posted net income of $13.1 million, or 25 cents per share, compared with a net loss of $62.9 million, or $1.25 per share, a year earlier, when it took charges for unemployment benefits. Detroit-based American Axle reported profit of 42 cents per share excluding restructuring charges and worker buyouts, while analysts expected 24 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. "This is the third quarter in a row where the company significantly beats consensus expectations, which reinforces our view that the Street underestimates the positive impact from reducing AXL's labor costs," Lehman Brothers analyst Brian Johnson said in a note. TRW's third-quarter profit jumped on increased demand for car safety products such as airbags and electronic stability controls, but it narrowed its full-year earnings forecast. Net income rose to $23 million, or 22 cents per share, from $5 million, or 5 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding restructuring and asset impairment charges, TRW earned 29 cents per share, while analysts expected 27 cents. Goldman Sachs analyst Robert Barry said in a note TRW's gross margin came in significantly below expectations, with strength in foreign currencies and a product launch adding more to revenue than to gross margin. "The results represents a material year-over-year improvement, but falls short of expectations," Barry said. Lake Forest, Illinois-based Tenneco posted results excluding one-time items of 39 cents, a penny below the average analyst forecast, and said it did not expect global market conditions to change much the rest of the year. Tenneco's net income tripled to $21 million, or 45 cents per share, in the third quarter, from $7 million, or 16 cents per share, a year earlier. Three U.S. automotive dealership companies also reported results on Tuesday. Group 1 Automotive Inc ( GPI.N ) and Asbury Automotive Group Inc ( ABG.N ) posted quarterly profits below analysts' forecasts and cut their outlooks, sending shares down 3 percent and 6.8 percent, respectively. Sonic Automotive Inc ( SAH.N ), the No. 3 U.S. auto dealer chain, matched Wall Street estimates from continuing operations and backed its full-year outlook, and shares rose 4.9 percent. Goodyear shares rose $2.05, or 7.6 percent, to $29.16, American Axle rose 52 cents, or 2 percent, to $27.10 and Tenneco rose 31 cents, or 1 percent, to $30.16 on the New York Stock Exchange. TRW shares fell $1.80 or 5.8 percent, to $29.37 on the NYSE. (Additional reporting by  Poornima Gupta  in Detroit,  Ben Klayman  and  Nick Carey  in Chicago and  Scott Malone  in Boston)
