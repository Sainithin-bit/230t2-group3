 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Jeffrey Gundlach, one of the world's most widely watched credit investors, recommended betting against computer company Apple Inc, retailer Nordstrom Inc and the main U.S. stock index, the Standard & Poor's 500. 
 The Nordstrom stock "looks like death," said Gundlach, who runs $34 billion DoubleLine Capital. He likes natural gas and Spain's main stock index. (Reporting by Svea Herbst-Bayliss)
