 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Hedge fund manager David Einhorn, whose investment picks are closely watched, raced through a list of the companies he likes and has concerns about including Apple Inc and Martin Marietta Materials . 
 Einhorn, who runs Greenlight Capital, said that Apple is still penetrating markets and noted that once a customer has one Apple product they are sure to want another. He also said that Martin Marietta Materials has benefited from a one-time stimulus and is overvalued. Einhorn joked that he feels he is not missing much for not being invested in China.
