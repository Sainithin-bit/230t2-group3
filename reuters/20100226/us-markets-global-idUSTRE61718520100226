 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - European stocks and crude oil rose as the United States reported the economy grew more strongly in the fourth quarter than it had previously estimated, but U.S. stocks see-sawed as Wall Street took a dimmer view of the latest data. 

 The dollar fell against major currencies as traders sold the greenback to cover extreme euro short positions as worries over Europe's debt crisis eased, a day after the euro fell to a one-year low against the yen. The euro hit a session high after Bloomberg reported that Germany may buy Greek bonds through lender KfW Group. Reuters had reported on February 11 that Germany was considering using KFW to buy Greek debt. Greece has been at the center of the euro's struggles the last few months, with its fiscal debt this year estimated at more than 120 percent of gross domestic product, the highest of any euro zone member. In mid-day trading Friday, the euro was up 0.45 percent at $1.3616 from a previous session close of $1.3555. Against the Japanese yen, the dollar was down 0.25 percent at 88.85 from a previous session close of 89.070. World stocks measured in the MSCI All-Country World Index was up 0.75 percent. "The bigger narrative remains in Europe and in the absence of negative news today we are seeing the euro consolidating a bit. The gains seem to be a result of short-covering" on the euro, said Greg Salvaggio, senior vice president for capital markets at Tempus Consulting in Washington. "Whatever anxieties (about Greece) we have are already priced in, at least based on what we know," said Warren West, principal at Greentree Brokerage Services in Philadelphia. Oil prices rose as much as 2 percent to trade near $80 a barrel after the upward revision in the U.S. gross domestic product data helped revive lackluster sentiment. The government reported the economy grew at a 5.9 percent annual pace in the fourth quarter, revised from the previous estimate of growth of 5.7 percent. But the data showed that consumer spending the residential investment were lackluster. An industry report that existing home sales fell 7.2 percent last month also dented sentiment on Wall Street. The Dow Jones industrial average  was down 5.74 points, or 0.06 percent, at 10,315.29. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index was down 0.68 points, or 0.06 percent, at 1,102.26. The Nasdaq Composite Index  was down 2.46 points, or 0.11 percent, at 2,231.76. Volume was light as a major snowstorm blanked the East Coast. "There was a lot of economic data this morning, most of them worst than expected," said Peter Jankovskis, co-chief investment officer at OakBrook Investments LLC in Lisle, Illinois. "Offsetting that is the fact that the dollar has declined somewhat and in general, when the dollar has been declining, that's positive for equities. The dollar was down against a basket of major trading-partner currencies, with the U.S. Dollar Index down 0.60 percent at 80.306 from a previous session close of 80.787. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index of top shares closed up 1.1 percent at 1,007.51 points. European bank and commodity stocks led the share price gains as metal and oil prices rose. U.S. crude oil futures rose, and global stock and commodities' prices were firmer, boosting commodity-linked currencies such as the Australian and New Zealand dollars. U.S. light sweet crude oil  rose $1.59, or 2.03 percent, to $79.76 per barrel, and spot gold prices XAU=> rose $10.20, or 0.92 percent, to $1115.90. The Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index was up 3.26 points, or 1.2 percent, at 274.13. U.S. Treasury debt prices were higher. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note was up 7/32, with the yield at 3.6061 percent. The 2-year U.S. Treasury note  was up /32, with the yield at 0.8157 percent. The 30-year U.S. Treasury bond was up 20/32, with the yield at 4.5414 percent.
