 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Sallie Krawcheck has had just about enough of the griping from within the ranks and sniping from people who left. 

 The celebrated Bank of America ( BAC.N ) wealth management chief says the Merrill Lynch takeover last year benefited the brokerage famously known as the "Thundering Herd" and has proven far less disruptive than feared. Brokers' complaints at Merrill center on minor issues, she said, but the merger has given them more tools to attract and keep lucrative clients -- and make more money. "If people talk about a paper cut, it means that their arm is not severed," she said in an exclusive interview. "You can always find the disgruntled financial adviser out there in the branches." One of the world's largest wealth managers, Merrill intends to go on offense this year by gathering deposits, bolstering offerings for a wider array of investors, and tapping BofA's commercial bank customers to expand retirement investment services. Krawcheck, 45, sees the Merrill wealth management business, Merrill's high net worth program and U.S. Trust, a private bank unit, all gaining share from rivals. The bank also will weather the flight of brokers to independent firms. "We're ready to run," Krawcheck said in the interview. "People here are ready to go." Krawcheck, one of the highest-ranking women in U.S. financial services and arguably the most recognized, has been tasked with steering 40,000 wealth management employees through the integration of the largest U.S. bank and the storied Merrill franchise. BROKER EXODUS? Traditional Wall Street brokerages have been under attack in the wake of a financial crisis that prompted thousands of advisers to jump ship and forced Merrill into the arms of BofA. Hundreds of advisers have set up their own independent firms, the so-called breakaway broker movement. Merrill's adviser ranks fell by more than 1,000 people, or roughly 7 percent, to 15,006 last year. The breakaway trend has been overblown, said Krawcheck, who stressed that fourth-quarter attrition was at decade lows. Brokers are leaving but not hurting the business, she said. "The industry continues to see some advisers go independent. They tend to be advisers who have lower production and fewer assets," she said. "We tend to keep a good chunk of the assets when they go independent." Merrill fared better than rivals like Morgan Stanley Smith Barney ( MS.N ), which is in the middle of a merger, and UBS ( UBSN.VX )( UBS.N ). Rising markets helped boost client balances by 11 percent to $1.44 trillion last year, despite $93 billion of net outflows across the bank's wealth and investment management arm. "SECRET PLAN" Also overblown were fears that Merrill's business culture would be spoiled, she said, as the commercial bankers of BofA look to contain costs and ask brokers to sell loans and checking accounts. Brian Moynihan, the bank's new CEO and briefly head of wealth management in 2008, and the company's board, she said, so far have maintained a light touch. "The guidance I get from Brian and the board is about being additive to Merrill Lynch, not shifting it, changing it or contorting it by any means," Krawcheck said. "If there's a secret plan, they haven't shown it to me yet." Instead, the bank is investing heavily in the business, including a $20 million advertising campaign and a new deposit system that has helped gather $25 billion from clients. Krawcheck reaffirmed the bank not only intends to keep U.S. Trust, but expand it as part of an 18,000-strong adviser force that can serve a range of investors: from people with $250,000 in assets upwards to multimillionaires. The bank also is combining online brokerage services owned by the two company into one platform, Merrill Edge, targeting investors with less than $250,000 in assets.
