 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - President Barack Obama's healthcare "summit" with congressional Republicans ended -- as expected -- without an agreement on how to fix the troubled $2.5 trillion healthcare industry. 

 Here are some questions and answers about the meeting, and what might happen next with healthcare reform. WHO 'WON' THE SUMMIT? Both sides used the event to score political points. The summit achieved at least one of Obama's goals by bringing the focus of the healthcare debate back to the White House, as he spent more than six hours moderating a largely civil discussion of the issue with Democratic and Republican congressional leaders, spending much of the time sharing his view of the need for a healthcare revamp and defending his proposals. His rival Republicans used the summit to press many of their points to the television audience, arguing that healthcare revamp plans reached by the Democrats after more than a year of work should be thrown out, saying the Democratic plans were too broad, too costly and would lead to too much government control over healthcare. Afterward, Republican leaders said Obama had not given them a fair chance to speak and that they did not expect any members of their party would support the Democratic proposals. "I just don't think the president was listening," said Jon Kyl, the second-ranking Republican in the Senate. DID THE BASHING OF INSURANCE COMPANIES MATTER? Obama's healthcare revamp plan, which he posted on Monday, included a new program for tighter regulation of insurance companies, and many of the speakers, both Republicans and Democrats, criticized the industry. Senator Jay Rockefeller, a Democrat, likened insurers to a shark swimming below the surface and attacking, saying: "Nobody has particular oversight of them; they're not under any antitrust-type rules. They can do what they want." Representative Charles Boustany, a Republican, said: "We all agree on prohibiting insurance companies from arbitrarily canceling insurance policies. That's a no-brainer." But insurance company stocks had a good day on Wall Street, where investors have little concern the healthcare reform effort will ever have enough teeth to affect their profits. Analysts said they expected a much more diluted version of the plan would eventually be adopted. WHAT HAPPENS NEXT? In theory, the two sides will continue to discuss healthcare reform. Obama spent much of the day stressing that the two parties had many areas of agreement on healthcare, and called on the two sides to work together to bridge those gaps. In his remarks closing the summit, he urged Republicans to do some "soul-searching" on healthcare to try to find common ground on which they could bend from their unflinching opposition. But Republicans made it clear the day's events had not lessened their resistance to the Democratic healthcare reform bills, which passed with just one Republican vote in the House and no Republican support in the Senate. Obama said in his remarks the Democrats would go ahead and make their own decisions about how to proceed if Republicans did not shift, and do so soon. "The question I'm going to ask myself and I ask of all of you, is there enough serious effort that in a month's time or a few weeks' time or six weeks' time, we could actually resolve something? And if we can't, we've got to go ahead and make some decisions." Republicans have said they expected the Democrats would try to use a parliamentary procedure to push their own healthcare bill through the Senate with no Republican votes and Obama's comments appeared to leave the door open for that possibility.
