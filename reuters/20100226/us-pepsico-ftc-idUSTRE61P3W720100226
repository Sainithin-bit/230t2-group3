 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - PepsiCo Inc ( PEP.N ) has won U.S. antitrust approval to buy two of its largest bottlers on condition that it take steps to safeguard a rival's business information, the Federal Trade Commission said on Friday. 

 Under an agreement with the FTC, PepsiCo will set up a firewall to ensure that PepsiCo employees do not see confidential Dr Pepper Snapple Group ( DPS.N ) business information, the agency said in a statement. The order will be in place for 20 years, the commission said. Pepsi, which had announced the approval of the $7.8 billion deal late Thursday, said that it planned to close the deal after the market closed Friday. PepsiCo launched its takeover bid for two bottlers -- Pepsi Bottling Group Inc PBG.N and PepsiAmericas Inc PAS.N -- in April, and finally struck a deal in August.
