 LONDON  (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc posted a 13.3 percent rise in second-quarter operating profit at its international businesses at constant exchange rates, helped by a strong performance from Asda in Britain. 

 The world's biggest retailer, which serves over 100 million shoppers a year from over 7,900 stores in 16 countries, said on Thursday underlying international operating profit was $1.38 billion in the three months to July 31. International sales at constant exchange rates were up 11.5 percent at $28.16 billion. In the first quarter, international operating income rose 7.8 percent on sales up 9.1 percent at constant exchange rates. Wal-Mart, which employs more than 2 million people and makes just under a quarter of its sales outside the United States, said group earnings per share was $0.88 in the second quarter. Like-for-like sales at Asda, Britain's second-biggest grocer, increased 7.2 percent, excluding fuel, for the second quarter. This compares with growth of 8.4 percent in the first-quarter.
