 BERLIN  (Reuters) - Canadian auto parts group Magna MGa.TO and its Russian partner Sberbank improved their offer for carmaker Opel at the last minute to seal a deal with General Motors, a source close to the negotiations told Reuters. 

 The source said a GM board meeting next week could formalize the decision on the winning Opel bidder. Magna was battling Belgium-based investor RHJ International ( RHJI.BR ) for control of the venerable German-based carmaker. (Reporting by  Gernot Heller ; Writing by  Noah Barkin )
