 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve bought $20.400 billion net of agency mortgage-backed securities in the latest week, the New York Fed said on its website on Thursday. 

 That is up from the previous week's net purchases of $19.150 billion. The purchases brought the U.S. central bank's purchase of mortgage bonds guaranteed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the Federal Home Loan Bank system to roughly $741.6 billion since January. The Fed said it bought $27.069 billion gross of agency MBS from August 6 through August 12. At the same time, it sold $6.669 billion in mortgage securities. The Fed aims to buy up to $1.25 trillion of agency MBS in a bid to bring down mortgage rates and to stimulate the battered housing sector and the overall economy.
