 (Reuters) - U.S. carrier Delta Air Lines Inc ( DAL.N ) and the Atlanta airport are close to a lease agreement that would pave the way for an $800 million bond sale, the biggest such offering in the U.S. this year, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the talks. 

 The world's busiest airport will use the proceeds to pay for a new international terminal, the news agency said. It said the airport is in talks with Atlanta-based Delta and other airlines as their leases expire after 30 years. A lease accord may come this month, clearing a path for the bonds, the news agency quoted the people as saying. Delta, the airport's largest tenant, linked the lease negotiations and the debt sale by threatening to move some flights unless the city cut the terminal's price, according to the news agency. The Atlanta airport and Delta did not immediately respond to calls seeking comment. (Reporting by  S. John Tilak  in Bangalore; Editing by Hans Peters)
