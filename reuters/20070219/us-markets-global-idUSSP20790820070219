 LONDON  (Reuters) - European and Japanese stocks scaled multi-year highs on Monday on talk of mergers and bids, while interest rate speculation weakened the low-yielding yen slightly against the dollar and euro. 


 With the Bank of Japan starting its two-day policy meeting on Tuesday and both the Federal Reserve and Bank of England due to issue minutes of their latest rate-setting meetings on Wednesday, eyes were firmly on the global rates outlook. "The minutes may give some insight into the perceived balance of risks between growth and inflation and what it means for future monetary policy in the UK and the U.S.," analysts at Lloyds TSB Corporate Markets wrote in a research note. But Monday's biggest mover in global currency markets was the pound, which fell sharply after Britain's central bank warned some sterling depreciation would probably be necessary to narrow Britain's large current account deficit. Oil slipped to below $59 a barrel, pressured by expectations of warmer weather in the United States and supported by threats to supply in Nigeria. Trading in many markets was subdued, with much of Asia shut for Chinese New Year celebrations and the United States closed for the Presidents' Day holiday. But stocks around the world surged on a wave of M&A stories, particularly in the retail sector, and on strong prospects for mining companies enjoying buoyant base metals prices. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index  .FTEU3 , driven since last year by a boom in mergers and forecast-beating earnings, closed unofficially at 1,549.6, its highest closing level since December 2000. Paris's CAC-40 index  .FCHI , Frankfurt's DAX  .GDAXI  and London's FTSE 100 index  .FTSE  Paris's CAC-40 index, also hit their highest levels in more than six years. The top gainer was Germany's DaimlerChrysler DCXGn.DE, up 3.6 percent on talk several suitors had emerged for its loss-making U.S. unit Chrysler, and that it had been discussing a sale to General Motors ( GM.N ) for at least two months. Anglo American ( AAL.L ) led the charge among mining companies, climbing 3.3 percent after a report that it will return up to $4 billion to investors in a share buy-back to be announced later this week. Japan's Nikkei average  .N225  closed earlier at its highest since May 2000, buoyed by signs of a possible tie-up between Daimaru Inc. and Matsuzakaya Holdings Co. that would create Japan's biggest department store group. The broader TOPIX index added 0.31 percent, nearing its 2006 peak and close to its highest since November 1991. At 1755 GMT the MSCI All-Country World Index .MSCIWD was 0.23 percent higher at 381.56. RATES UNCERTAINTY Uncertainty over interest rates was the main driver on the foreign exchange and bond markets. Above-forecast economic growth numbers in Japan had boosted expectations the Bank of Japan would raise its key rate to 0.5 percent on Wednesday, but speculation lingered that it could come under political pressure not to move. Meanwhile a run of weaker-than-expected U.S. data and comments by Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke that U.S. growth may be slowing and inflation easing have reignited talk of a possible interest rate cut there in the coming months. The yen also slipped, amid speculation that a quarter-point BoJ rate rise this week would be insufficient to stop investors using it as a funding vehicle for higher-yielding assets. "Regardless of whether the BOJ actually raises rates, the fact of the matter is that when you've got the Bank of England taking rates up to 5.5 percent ... in the next two weeks and the European Central Bank raising rates by another quarter of a percent, it's very expensive to get long of yen," said Monica Fan, global head of FX strategy at RBC Capital Markets. By 1755 GMT the dollar was up a touch at 119.70 yen  JPY= , recovering from Friday's six-week low of 118.96. The euro  EUR=  was trading slightly firmer at $1.3152 but was stronger against the yen at 157.45 yen EURJPY=. Japanese government bond futures fell and euro zone government bonds largely held gains made last week. Ten-year Bund yields EU10YT=RR were up slightly at 4.062 percent.
