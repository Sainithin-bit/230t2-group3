 LONDON  (Reuters) - Major oil companies are playing a bigger role in the search for oil and gas from unconventional sources, consultants Wood Mackenzie said on Monday. 


 The sector, including heavy oil, tight gas, coal bed methane and shale oil, is currently dominated by independent companies, which have pioneered development of these fuels in North America. But this is beginning to change, with big oil companies now expanding in this area as the rise in commodity prices makes it economic to exploit some of these resources. "With conventional non-OPEC supply expected to peak within the next decade and the difficulties in discovering accessible gas reserves, international oil companies withafford growth ambition cannot affort to ignore these unconventional reserves," said Phaedra Powilanska-Burnell of Wood Mackenzie. The consultancy believes unconventional oil and gas from sources that traditionally have been hard to exploit will supply more than 20 percent of global demand by 2025. It also estimated they will make up more than 40 percent of U.S. gas supply by 2010. Wood Mackenzie's study estimated the supply of unconventional hydrocarbons could be as much as 3.6 trillion barrels of oil equivalent globally. These fuels have been unattractive in the past because of the difficulty of exploiting them. But concerns about tighter oil supply and demand growth, plus higher prices have made them more attractive. Wood Mackenzie estimates that an oil price of $40 a barrel over the medium term would create a favorable environment for the exploitation of unconventional oil, (apart from shale oil), outside the areas in North America already under development.
