 SYDNEY  (Reuters) - Australian insurer Suncorp-Metway Ltd. ( SUN.AX ), which is all set to acquire rival Promina Group Ltd. PMN.AX said on Tuesday first-half net profit rose 16 percent helped by strong profits from its banking division. 


 Brisbane-based Suncorp, which is one step away from sealing the A$7.9 billion ($6.2 billion) Promina deal, said profit for six months ended December 31 rose to A$527 million ($415 million). A Reuters survey of eight analysts had forecast an average profit of A$480 million. Shares in Suncorp gained 16 percent since July and Monday's close, compared with a 18 percent rise in the benchmark S&P/ASX 200 Index .AXJO in the same period. ($1=A$1.27)
