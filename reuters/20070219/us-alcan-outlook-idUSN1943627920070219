 MONTREAL  (Reuters) - Alcan Inc. AL.TO ( AL.N ) is happy to remain independent, amid speculation that big international miners may want to buy their way into the aluminum sector, the Canadian company's chief executive said on Monday. 


 "We're not looking for being taken over. We're doing very well by ourselves thank you," Dick Evans, president and chief executive of Alcan, told reporters after a luncheon speech. "We have plenty of capital to grow our business strongly. We've got a very good pipeline of projects, a very capable management team," he added. Alcan recently forecast that its cash flow for 2007 would top the $3 billion generated in 2006. Takeover speculation has swirled in recent months around global No. 1 aluminum maker Alcoa Inc. ( AA.N ) and Alcan, the world's second-largest maker of primary aluminum, in part because the commodities rally has extended to the lightweight metal. Stock prices for both Pittsburgh-based Alcoa and Montreal-based Alcan rose last week after the London Times reported that BHP Billiton ( BHP.AX ) ( BLT.L ) and Rio Tinto Ltd. ( RIO.AX ) ( RIO.L ) were considering separate $40 billion bids for Alcoa. Wall Street analysts were skeptical that takeover bids were looming. By Monday, Alcoa shares were almost flat and Alcan shares were off just under 1 percent. Alcan shares were down 54 Canadian cents at C$63.22 on the Toronto Stock Exchange and off 39 cents at $54.76 on the New York Stock Exchange on Monday afternoon. Alcoa shares were up 7 cents at $34.70 in New York. Alcan shares have risen some 20 percent in Toronto over the past three months on strong aluminum prices, but are below their 12-month high of C$64.99 set in early May. Evans said Alcan's stock, which is widely held and gives the company a market capitalization of some $20 billion, is not trading on a takeover premium. "I think the takeover risk comes when a company is struggling, underperforming, and there is much more value in the company than management is getting out. That's what some of the writers have said about Alcoa," Evans said. ($1=$1.16 Canadian)
