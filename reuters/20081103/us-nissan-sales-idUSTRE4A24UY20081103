 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co on Monday said its sales in the U.S. market for October, dropped 33 percent as the industry was hit by a steep downturn tied to consumer uncertainty and tighter credit. 

 "I think we were pretty much where the market was," Al Castignetti, vice president and general manager of Nissan division sales told Reuters. Nissan sold 56,948 vehicles, down 33 percent from the same month a year earlier it said. Nissan-brand sales were down 36 percent, whiles sales for the Japanese automaker's luxury Infiniti brand were down 29 percent. The change was based on sales figures that were not adjusted for the number of selling days. October had 27 sales days compared with 26 percent a year earlier meaning results on the adjusted basis tracked by analysts would have been lower. (Editing by Maureen Bavdek)
