 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Honda Motor Co Ltd posted an adjusted 28 percent drop in U.S. light vehicle sales in October amid the downturn in the U.S. economy and sagging consumer sentiment. 

 Honda said sales fell to 85,864 vehicles in October from 114,799 a year earlier, or 25.2 percent if the figures were not adjusted for the extra selling day last month compared with the year-earlier period. Car sales including Honda and its luxury Acura brand fell by an adjusted 25 percent, while truck sales fell 32 percent, Honda reported. Sales of Honda's fuel-efficient Fit subcompact rose 28 percent on an adjusted basis to 6,478 vehicles, while sales of its iconic Accord fell 38.4 percent and Civic fell nearly 25 percent. Among larger vehicles, sales of the Honda Odyssey minivan fell an adjusted 38.6 percent, while sales of the Honda CR-V crossover fell 24.4 percent. (Reporting by  David Bailey , editing by Gerald E.
