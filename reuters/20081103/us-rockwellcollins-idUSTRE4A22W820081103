 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Rockwell Collins Inc ( COL.N ) said on Monday that quarterly profit rose 17 percent on higher sales of its aerospace electronics, but cut its fiscal 2009 outlook due to the effect of a slowing global economy and a longer-than-expected strike at Boeing Co ( BA.N ). 

 The company, which makes a range of cockpit gear and high-tech systems for commercial and military aircraft, reported profit of $182 million, or $1.13 per share, for the fourth quarter ended on September 30, compared with $156 million, or 93 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding a one-time tax benefit, earnings were $1.05 per share. On that basis, Wall Street was expecting $1.06, on average, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue rose 4 percent to $1.28 billion. For fiscal 2009, Rockwell Collins forecast earnings of $4.25 to $4.45 per share, down from its last outlook of $4.35 to $4.55 on September 10 -- during the first week of the Boeing strike. Analysts are expecting $4.39 per share, on average. Boeing's 27,000 assembly workers shut down the company's commercial plane plants on September 6 after voting against its contract offer. They voted to accept an updated offer on Saturday and started to return to work late on Sunday, ending a 58-day strike, the longest in more than a decade.
