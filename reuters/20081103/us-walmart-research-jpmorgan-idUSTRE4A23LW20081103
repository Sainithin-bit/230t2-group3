 (Reuters) - Wal-Mart ( WMT.N ) would benefit from its improved store base and merchandise, new capital allocation plans and reduced margin drains from its international unit, said J.P. Morgan Securities, which upgraded the world's largest retailer to "overweight" from "neutral." 

 Wal-Mart is "perfectly positioned" as the low-cost leader and should outperform its peers and capture market share as retail bankruptcies continue, JP Morgan analyst Charles Grom said in a note to clients. Shares of the company were up 1.5 percent at $56.66 in trading before the bell. They closed at $55.81 Friday on the New York Stock Exchange. The analyst also raised his price target to $65 from $56 on the stock of the company, which plans to pull back on opening big new stores in the United States and instead remodel existing locations or open smaller stores across the globe. The discounter's improved store base and merchandise should enable it to maintain its customers when the economy improves, Grom said. Additionally, margin drains from Wal-Mart's international division were subsiding and poised for accretion to the overall model, particularly in Japan, he said. Grom expects the retailer's revised capital allocation plans to generate noticeable free cash flow and return on investments improvements beginning in 2009.
