 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. factory activity shrank further in October, according to an industry report released on Monday. 

 U.S. construction spending fell a smaller-than-expected 0.3 percent in September as private home building fell along with public construction while private non-residential building was nudged slightly higher, a Commerce Department report showed on Monday. KEY POINTS: ISM: * The Institute for Supply Management said its index of national factory activity fell to 38.9 in October from 43.5 in September. * The level of 50 separates contraction from expansion. * Economists had expected a reading of 41.5, according to the median of forecasts in a Reuters poll. * The 85 forecasts ranged from 37.8 to 48.5. CONSTRUCTION SPENDING: * Analysts polled by Reuters ahead of the report were expecting a 0.8 percent decrease in construction spending in September from the unchanged figure in August that was revised to a 0.3 percent increase. * Private residential construction fell 1.3 percent and public construction fell by the same margin, the sharpest fall in more than six months. * Overall private construction rose 0.1 percent led by a 1.2 percent increase in nonresidential building. COMMENTS: RICHARD SPARKS, SENIOR EQUITIES ANALYST, SCHAEFFER'S INVESTMENT RESEARCH, CINCINNATI, OHIO: "I think it continues to indicate that the economy is slowing down. I don't think there's any question at this point that we're probably in a recession." "Certainly the ISM index has been trailing down now for some four-plus years, and now it's near its lowest point from back in 2001-2002." "So for now, the index is at a similar point that it was back at the point of the last economic turndown, so I don't know that we can say (a recession) is going to be worse (than expected) yet unless these numbers continue to weaken." CARL BIRKELBACH, HEAD OF BIRKELBACH MANAGEMENT, CHICAGO: "I noticed the Chicago Tribune indicated that there are three to four buildings under construction right now in Chicago and they're basically stopping. What this figure means is that the economy is slowing even worse than those bears were expecting. It's really an indication that we overbuilt." "The big question is have those lower prices discounted what's going to happen in the next year, and not is the economy going to go down further, or is unemployment going to increase. I think there is very little controversy about whether the economy will get worse. It's going to be a tough two to five years." IAN SHEPHERDSON, CHIEF U.S. ECONOMIST, HIGH FREQUENCY ECONOMICS, VALHALLA, NEW YORK: "The further decline in the index, following the steep September fall, reflects sharp declines in orders, production, and employment, all of which are now at deep recession levels. The export orders index also plunged - it is not a headline component - to just 41.0 from 52.0, consistent, if sustained, with a catastrophic drop in exports. This report is disastrous in every respect apart from prices paid, which melted to just 37.0 from 53.5, but that is scant comfort. The key issue now is just how much of this plunge in activity reflects the shock of the market meltdown and how much will be sustained. We think there will be a modest bounce next month but the trend is horrific." WILLIAM LARKIN, FIXED INCOME PORTFOLIO MANAGER, CABOT MONEY MANAGEMENT, SALEM, MASSACHUSETTS: "The data was very well priced into the market and that is why you are not seeing a drastic shift in U.S. Treasuries or the equity market. Right now the market is expecting economic weakness -- the market is trying to sort of estimate going forward the depth and breadth of the global recession, which we know is in place. The monthly employment data that is coming out at the end of the week will be more important." MICHAEL WOOLFOLK, SENIOR CURRENCY STRATEGIST, BANK OF NEW YORK-MELLON, NEW YORK: "It's certainly the lowest we've seen in some time, and it reflects the fact that manufacturing has joined the rest of the economy in recession. With the current and expected layoffs, this will have a negative impact on employment. That's the overriding theme on this side of the Atlantic this week -- the continued deterioration in employment. It tends to be a lagging indicator, and we'll probably see it deteriorate until well after we've put in a bottom. "It's counterintuitive, but this may help support the dollar even as it undermines confidence in the U.S. economy. The dollar has been the beneficiary in this global financial crisis. ROBERT MACINTOSH, CHIEF ECONOMIST, EATON VANCE CORP, BOSTON: "Pretty grim. It means we're in a recession, it's as simple as that... a pretty solid manufacturing recession. "I don't think it adds anything that already wasn't in the thought process of investors. We are in a recession, the question is how long or deep is it going to be? "Where is this group of economists that is charged with declaring a recession. Why haven't they said anything?" CHRISTOPHER LOW, CHIEF ECONOMIST, FTN FINANCIAL, NEW YORK: ISM: "It looks very weak. The biggest surprise is the sharp drop in the prices paid index. This indicates the shift in commodity prices is being felt by most companies." "It's pretty clear that the economy downshifted significantly in October. Until now, the manufacturing sector which has been supported by exports is now feeling the pain. This index is lower than anytime during the 2001 recession. "There's not a lot of joy in these numbers." CONSTRUCTION SPENDING: "It's down less than expected which is good. But the trend is still negative but the biggest surprise in the third-quarter GDP report was the rise in business spending for structure considering no one could find financing." MARKET REACTION: STOCKS: U.S. equity indexes pare gains after ISM data. BONDS: Treasury debt prices show little reaction to data. DOLLAR: U.S. dollar trims gains versus yen.
