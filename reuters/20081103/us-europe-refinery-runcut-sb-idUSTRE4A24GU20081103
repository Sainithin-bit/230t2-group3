 LONDON  (Reuters) - Weak oil demand may force European refiners to start cutting runs or delay plant restarts after maintenance to reduce output of loss-making products such as naphtha or gasoline, analysts said on Monday. 

 Oil refiners last cut runs significantly in January, prompted by rising crude oil prices. Refiners across the globe shut about 10 percent of their processing capacity to reduce intake of crude oil, which struck $100 a barrel and outpaced the price rise in products. This time, with crude prices dropping, cuts may be triggered more by weak demand for fuel. "This is a market telling refiners that demand is weak. Refineries have to cut runs if margins are below break even," said Mike Wittner, Global Head of Oil Research of Societe Generale. Reuters data on Monday showed margins for some European refiners, with total capacity to process 16 million barrels of crude oil per day, have fallen into the red, suggesting some companies are making losses by producing oil products. Prices for distillates such as heating oil and diesel have been supported in Europe ahead of the peak winter demand and by the increasing popularity of diesel vehicles. But the relative strength of distillates is offset by losses on other products and local demand can be met by imports. Prices of gasoline, high sulphur fuel oil for ships and naphtha for gasoline blending and petrochemicals have plummeting more sharply than crude oil, which has fallen over 50 percent to around $65 from their record highs above $147 hit in July. European gasoline's relative value, or crack, to North Sea Brent crude has fallen to negative since late September in the Rotterdam area and it is about $2.50 cheaper a barrel than the same amount of crude oil. High sulphur fuel oil is now about $22 cheaper than Brent in Northwest Europe, while its crack was about minus $6 a barrel in September. Naphtha has lost value the most significantly. Its crack has remained around Brent minus $23 a barrel since last week in northwest Europe, the lowest since 1991. Historically naphtha is a high value product and its strongest crack was Brent plus about $10 a barrel in May last year. FOLLOWING ASIA In Asia, run cuts are already underway due mainly to weak naphtha. Companies in India, South Korea, Taiwan and Japan lowered operation rates at their naphtha crackers. Goldman Sachs said run cuts were likely to spread elsewhere. "Record-low gasoline and naphtha cracks have generated significant downward pressure on refining margins and have begun to force refinery run cuts in Asia," the bank said in a research note. "It will be difficult to avoid broader refinery run cuts." Analysts also said Europe may also see delays to refinery restarts after planned maintenance in the fourth quarter. "Some refiners are coming back up after maintenance but I do not know how quickly," Societe Generale's Wittner said. It is difficult, however, to pin down refinery restart delays to technical issues or poor margins, he added. Trading sources said on Monday the restart of oil units at Europe's largest refinery will be delayed by two weeks. Royal Dutch Shell ( RDSa.L ) will restart units at its Pernis refinery in the Netherlands, including one crude distillation unit, in mid-November from an initial plan in early November. But they said the reason for the delay was not clear and Shell declined to comment. Other leading refineries, including BP Plc's ( BP.L ) Nerefco, also in the Netherlands, are expected to completed planned maintenance in November. (Reporting by Ikuko Kao)
