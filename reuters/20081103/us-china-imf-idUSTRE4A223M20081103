 HONG KONG  (Reuters) - China's economy will slow but should remain relatively strong and help to support the rest of Asia, the International Monetary Fund said on Monday, predicting a very difficult year for the global economy in 2009. 

 "Growth in China is going to slow but remain relatively robust," David Burton, Asia-Pacific director of the International Monetary Fund, told reporters in Hong Kong. "It should be a source of strength for the region." Burton said the global economic environment would be tough in 2009. "The global economy is slowing and 2009 will be a very difficult year," he said. "I hope we'll see some recovery in 2010." (Reporting by Susan Fenton, Editing by David Stamp)
