 SEOUL  (Reuters) - South Korea said on Monday it plans to pump an extra $11 billion into its economy next year to help soften the impact of the global financial storm, which is beginning to hit exports -- the country's economic lifeblood. 

 The pledge coincided with news of lower-than-expected inflation, which analysts saw as possibly paving the way for another interest rate cut this week after last week's record 75 basis point cut to prop up Asia's fourth largest economy. "The Bank of Korea will likely cut the rates further, at least by 25 basis points this Friday. If not, it may push the financial market into a tailspin again," said Park Jong-youn, fixed-income analyst at Woori Investment & Securities. The promise of more budget spending and tax cuts came just after data showed export growth had fallen to a 13-month low in October, offering stark proof of the damage from the global economic downturn. The pledge also follows last month's more than $130 billion package earmarked by the authorities to shore up the financial sector. "If the current situation continues, the economy is expected to grow by around 3 percent next year. If the global economy shrinks further, it may be difficult to achieve 3 percent growth," Finance Minister Kang Man-soo told reporters. With the new injection on top of a series of initiatives to guard the economy from the looming global recession, growth next year could reach 4 percent, Kang said, still short of the 5 percent the government had hoped for. Economists were cautious with forecasts. "While they (the measures) will certainly help, most investors believe it will take some time before benefits of those measures are reflected in the real economy," said Hwang Keum-dan, analyst at Samsung Securities. The promise of more aid and news that inflation in October hit 4.8 percent, its lowest since April, however, brought relief to the country's battered won and share prices which have both slumped by about a third this year. The won finished local trading up 2.3 percent at 1,261.6/3.0 per dollar. The main KOSPI share index finished 1.44 percent higher at 1,129.08 points, though analysts said that was in large part in reaction to October's dizzying falls. SMALL COMPANIES The 14 trillion won ($11 billion) package includes 11 trillion won in additional government spending next year and 3 trillion in tax cuts. Much of the extra spending is aimed at the real estate and construction industries. It represents roughly a 7 percent addition to original spending plans for next year. Seoul plans to increase spending on public construction projects, helping smaller firms get better access to credit and providing benefits for the poor. Money will also go to small businesses, which employ about 90 percent of the nation's workforce and which are fighting for survival because of the liquidity squeeze. South Korea's economy has looked particularly exposed to the global funding crunch, that has left its financial institutions struggling to raise funds to pay off foreign debt and made them reluctant to lend at home. Kang said he expected the current account to swing to a surplus next year of about $5 billion in 2009 after posting its first deficit in 11 years in 2008, estimated at $10 billion. The government will also sharply increase bond sales to fund intervention in the currency market and offer state guarantees on foreign-currency deposits at local financial institutions.
