 DETROIT  (Reuters) - U.S. auto suppliers urged the Bush administration on Monday to create a new loan guarantee program for the struggling industry and to accelerate loans under an already approved $25 billion program. 

 The Motor & Equipment Manufacturers Association (MEMA) released a copy of its letter sent to U.S. President George W. Bush. It urged the administration to create a new loan program for the auto supply industry under the $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program passed by Congress last month to shore up U.S. financial institutions in the face of a global credit crisis. "Without improved credit availability for the industry, we risk significant losses to motor vehicle demand, employment, and component and material production capacity," Bob McKenna, president of the trade group said. "Parts suppliers are the nation's largest manufacturing sector and the top manufacturing employer in seven states." The latest call for federal assistance from the embattled U.S. auto industry came as October sales data showed the weakest results for automakers in some 25 years. The U.S. auto industry and its political allies have pushed the Bush administration to expedite $25 billion in low-interest loans that were approved in late September and were intended to offset the cost of retooling factories to produce more fuel-efficient vehicles. General Motors Corp ( GM.N ) had also asked for a separate aid package of some $10 billion to help fund an acquisition of Chrysler LLC, people familiar with those talks have said. The Bush administration rebuffed that call for aid last week, saying it was not in negotiations with the automakers. The United Auto Workers union and the governors of six U.S. states, including Michigan, have called for a new federal aid package for the U.S. auto industry. Separately, Chrysler LLC, owned by Cerberus Capital Management, said it was urging consideration of a change in federal tax policy that would allow consumers to claim an income tax deduction for the cost of financing vehicles. The MEMA said the U.S. auto supply industry employs about 783,000 U.S. workers. (Editing by  Leslie Gevirtz )
