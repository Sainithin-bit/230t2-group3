 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Ramius, a U.S. hedge fund with $11 billion under management, is considering handing back its Hong Kong trading and advisory licenses, in a sign that some funds are retreating from Asia, the Financial Times reported. 

 The move comes amid increasing signs of a pullback from Asia by hedge funds amid a global financial market slump which is forcing them to raise cash and cut operating costs ahead of an anticipated surge in redemptions, the FT said. The article quoted Anthony Miller, a partner at Ramius, as saying that the possible abandonment of Hong Kong licenses was "mostly about cutting costs and reallocating money to the United States and Europe." He added: "We will continue trading Asia from New York and London." Ramius was not immediately available for comment. (Reporting by  Megan Davies )
