 (Reuters) - Wrapping up Tuesday's U.S. presidential elections, regardless of the outcome, will by itself help consumer sentiment, retailer Lowe's Cos ( LOW.N ) President Larry Stone told the Wall Street Journal in an interview. 

 Stone sounded concerned with negative presidential campaign ads, the paper said. Stone declined to comment on recent business trends or Wall Street's expectations for coming periods but indicated that certain products continued to sell decently, according to the paper. "Our replacement business has been good," Stone told the paper. "Our appliance business is not totally robust, but it's been good." Market-tracking firm Traqline's third-quarter numbers for Lowe's on appliances were good, and the industry level of discounting and promotions has been "status quo" from previous quarters, Stone told the paper.
