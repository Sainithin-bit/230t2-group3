 JERUSALEM  (Reuters) - Richmond Federal Reserve Bank President Jeffrey Lacker said on Monday the U.S. economy was definitely in a recession but he believed it would be fairly moderate in size. 

 "We are in a contraction. Up until the summer it was a fairly mild recession," Lacker, who will become a voting member of the Fed's interest rate-setting committee next year, told reporters after a speech at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. "I think it's definitely a recession at this point. How deep, how steep, and long it's going to be is uncertain. We don't know if it's going to be a garden variety recession or something steeper. I think it's most likely to be of a fairly moderate size," he said. (Reporting by  Adam Entous  and  Ari Rabinovitch ; editing by  Patrick Graham )
