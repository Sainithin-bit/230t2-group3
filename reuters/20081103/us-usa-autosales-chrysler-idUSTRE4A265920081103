 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Chrysler said on Monday that U.S. light vehicle sales fell 35 percent in October amid the U.S. auto industry downturn, and it would offer cash and financing incentives in November. 

 Sales fell to 94,530 vehicles in October among its Chrysler, Jeep and Dodge brands, from 145,316 vehicles a year earlier, the automaker said. Sales of its light-duty Dodge Ram pickup truck fell 21 percent in October, but it was still the automaker's top-selling vehicle. The launch of the new Dodge Ram is on schedule and its overall pickup truck share is on target, Chrysler said. Chrysler also said it will offer cash rebates of up to $6,000 for model year 2008 vehicles in November and zero percent financing for up to 72 months on 2008 model year vehicles in some markets. It also plans to offer lower-interest financing for 72 months on 2009 model year vehicles. The automaker said Chrysler brand sales fell 51 percent, Jeep sales fell 33 percent and Dodge sales fell 27 percent. (Reporting by  David Bailey ; editing by Jeffrey Benkoe)
