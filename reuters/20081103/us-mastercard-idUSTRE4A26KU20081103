 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - MasterCard Inc ( MA.N ), the world's second-largest card network, on Monday posted better-than-expected earnings, excluding items, as revenue rose, sending shares up 5 percent in after-hours trade. 

 The Purchase, New York-based company reported earnings excluding charges of $322 million, or $2.47 a share. Analysts on average expected earnings of $2.22 per share, according to Reuters Estimates. MasterCard's net loss was $194 million, or $1.49 per share, in the third-quarter following an after-tax charge of $515.5 million related to a settlement of antitrust litigation with Discover Financial Services ( DFS.N ). The result compared with earnings of $314 million, or $2.32 a share in the same quarter a year earlier. Revenue increased 24 percent to $1.34 billion. Mastercard's stock was up 5 percent at $150.92 in extended trade on Monday. Shares of the company lost around one-third of their value this year. (Reporting by  Juan Lagorio , editing by Bernard Orr)
