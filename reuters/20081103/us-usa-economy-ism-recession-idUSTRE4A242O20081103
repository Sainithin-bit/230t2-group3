 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The blow the global financial crisis has dealt to U.S. manufacturing may prove sustained as the overall economy slips into recession, said the Institute for Supply Management on Monday. 

 After a steep fall of manufacturers' new orders in October, these may take some time to rebound, said Norbert Ore, chairman of the Institute for Supply Management manufacturing business survey committee on a conference call with reporters. "Usually when we see new orders drop significantly it's not a one month event," Ore said. "It will take a while for the correction to take place," he added. Earlier, the Institute for Supply Management said its index of national factory activity fell to 38.9 in October from 43.5 in September. The level of 50 separates contraction from expansion, and a reading below 40 is exceptionally weak. If the overall ISM manufacturing index is under 41.1 "the overall economy is in decline and it would certainly be the beginnings of a recession if the overall trend continues," said Ore.
