 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co GT.N posted a smaller-than-expected drop in quarterly profit on Monday, as the company stepped up cost cuts in response to weaker demand in North America, sending shares up as much as 20 percent. 

 The largest U.S. tire maker also said it was on track to "significantly surpass" its planned cost cuts of $2 billion by 2009 after it has made aggressive production and workforce cuts to reflect the financial crisis and the slowing economy. "As we continue to manage through the current market conditions, we'll accelerate our actions under our 'cash is king' strategy," Goodyear Chief Executive Robert Keegan said on a conference call with analysts. Keegan said Goodyear's capital spending will be at the low end of its previously announced $1 billion to $1.3 billion range for 2008 and it will reduce spending further next year. Goodyear's third-quarter net income fell to $31 million, or 13 cents per share, from $668 million, or $2.75 per share, a year earlier, when Goodyear posted a $2.12 per-share gain on the sale of its engineered products business. Revenue rose 2 percent to $5.2 billion. Excluding one-time items, Goodyear reported earnings of 43 cents per share from continuing operations, while analysts on average expected it to report earnings of 33 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. The one-time charges included restructuring costs, a retirement fund for union workers, the impact from hurricanes in the United States, among others. The Akron, Ohio-based tire maker posted a $19 million operating loss in its key North American Tire market, its biggest unit. That compares with $66 million profit in the third quarter of 2007 but came in significantly better than the $61 million loss that JPMorgan analyst Himanshu Patel had expected. U.S. new auto sales were down nearly 13 percent through September from a year earlier amid a U.S. economic slowdown that has spread to other regions of the world. Goodyear is in the midst of closing 12 percent, or 92 of its company-owned U.S. stores and cutting 600 jobs as the U.S. economic downturn put more pressure on the company. The company has achieved $1.6 billion in cost savings since 2006 and said it was ahead of plans to cut $2 billion by 2009. Goodyear, which has about 30 percent of its tire sales by volume with automakers, has focused on selling a higher percentage of more expensive tires to offset the high cost of raw materials and the slowing economy. The company has also been focused on expanding production in lower-cost countries and in growth in emerging markets. Profits grew in its Latin America and Asia-Pacific units. Goodyear shares were up 85 cents or 9.5 percent at $9.77, off an earlier high at $10.67, on the New York Stock Exchange late on Monday morning. The stock was down 68 percent in 2008 through Friday, compared with a 57 percent decline in the Dow Jones U.S. automobiles and parts index .DJUSAP.
