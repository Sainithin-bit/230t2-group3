 LONDON  (Reuters) - The British government said on Friday the collapse of a Santander deal to buy 316 UK branches of state-backed bank RBS ( RBS.L ) was a matter for the companies, adding that it remained committed to promoting competition in the banking sector. 
 "This is a commercial matter for RBS and Santander," a Treasury spokesman said. Spain's Santander ( SAN.MC ) agreed to buy the branches in August 2010 but completion of the deal had been delayed as the two banks struggled with technology and separation issues.
