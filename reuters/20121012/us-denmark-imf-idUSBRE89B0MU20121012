 COPENHAGEN  (Reuters) - Denmark's central bank said on Friday it had signed a bilateral loan agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) worth 40 billion Danish crowns ($6.94 billion) to help boost the IMF's resources. 
 The agreement followed up on the commitment from a number of countries in the spring to increase IMF resources by $456 billion to support its capacity to promote global economic and financial stability, the central bank, Nationalbanken said in a statement.
