 ROME  (Reuters) - Standard & Poor's placed its A/A-1 rating on Italy on watch negative on Monday and said it saw a potential increase in the risks to Italy's growth prospects and financial stability due to policy coordination weakness in the euro zone. 
 It noted however that the government of Prime Minister Mario Monti had shown commitment to growth-enhancing reforms and fiscal consolidation. S&P said in a statement it saw increased risks to external financing if the current high borrowing rates persist for Italian public and private sector entities. It said it could lower Italy's ratings by up to two notches, but added that if its concerns were mitigated by appropriate policy action, it could affirm the ratings at the current level.
