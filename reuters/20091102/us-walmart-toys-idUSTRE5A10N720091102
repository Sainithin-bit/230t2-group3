 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc on Monday announced its second round of price cuts on toys as the world's biggest retailer backs up its intention to be the "price leader" this holiday shopping season. 

 U.S. Walmart stores are cutting prices on 100 toys, like the Buzz Lightyear talking action figure and Star Wars light sabers, by roughly 20 percent to 30 percent. The cuts are in addition to ones the retailer implemented at the end of September, when it began selling 100 toys for $10 each. The new prices will be available through December 25 or while supplies last. Wal-Mart has vowed to be the "price leader" this holiday season, and announced plans on October 21 to cut prices every week until Christmas to fend off rivals and win over shoppers. After it reduced toy prices at the end of September, Target Corp responded with price cuts of as much as 50 percent on toys like Barbie and G.I. Joe. Analysts said many of these holiday price cuts are planned in advanced, allowing retailers to protect their margins. But such cuts can be damaging to manufacturers, because they train shoppers to expect lower prices for their goods. They can also hurt retailers' profits if they must slash prices lower than expected to match competitors' prices, or they can not sell enough goods to offset the lower prices.
