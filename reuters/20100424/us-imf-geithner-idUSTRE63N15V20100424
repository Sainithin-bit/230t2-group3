 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Emerging-market economies should be given an increased say in global financial institutions at the cost of rich countries, Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said on Saturday. 

 In a speech to the International Monetary Fund, Geithner repeated a call for emerging market countries to adopt market-oriented currency exchange rates and said the U.S. would back developing counties in a bid for more IMF power. He said what was on the table from the developed world in talks on the issue did not go far enough. "We support a reduction in the size of the Board that preserves the existing number of emerging market and developing country chairs, including a move to all-elected chairs," Geithner said. A current effort to rejig voting quotas within the IMF "falls short" of what is needed to give an adequate say to developing markets. (Reporting by  Glenn Somerville ; editing by  Patrick Graham )
