 ATHENS  (Reuters) - About two-thirds of Greeks think their socialist government was either too slow to react or handled the economy poorly as the country's fiscal crisis deepened, an opinion poll showed on Saturday. 

 Greece, racing to get emergency funds to pay off maturing debt next month, asked on Friday to tap a 45 billion euro ($60.5 billion) rescue package put together by the European Union and the International Monetary Fund. The poll by ALCO for Sunday's Proto Thema newspaper showed that 37.3 percent of those asked believed the government moved slowly in dealing with the debt crisis, which has shaken the euro, while 28.2 percent said it made the wrong moves. Based on the poll, conducted nationwide from April 21-23 on a sample of 1,000 people, only 23.1 percent approved of the government's moves in handling the economy during the crisis, indicating declining confidence. The poll also showed that 65.2 percent thought Prime Minister George Papandreou had misled people about the true state of the economy. By contrast 26.1 percent thought Papandreou, elected last October, had not known the extent of the country's problems. Another poll by Public Issue last week showed that only 47 percent of Greeks trusted Papandreou to handle the economy compared to 55 percent in February. Greece's borrowing costs climbed to prohibitive levels after it revealed following the October election that its budget hole last year was 12.7 percent of its annual economic output, prompting credit rating downgrades. The EU statistics office last week revised the 2009 deficit upwards by nearly a point to 13.6 percent of Gross Domestic Product. Greece's debt is projected to rise to 120.4 percent of GDP this year. Despite the fiscal mess and the austerity measures that the government has already announced to repair public finances, most Greeks said they would not move their money abroad or emigrate if they had the chance.
