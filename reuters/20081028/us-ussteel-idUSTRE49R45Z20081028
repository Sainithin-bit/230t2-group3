 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. Steel Corp ( X.N ) said on Tuesday that third-quarter profit more than tripled on higher demand and prices, but forecast a decline in the fourth quarter, especially in its European operations. 

 Net earnings were $919 million, or $7.79 per share, compared with $269 million, or $2.27 per share in the same quarter last year, the Pittsburgh-based steelmaker said, Revenue soared to $7.31 billion from $4.4 billion. Analysts on average were expecting earnings of $7.14 and revenue of $7.187 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John Surma said the results were driven by strong perfomance in its flat-rolled products segment and also in its tubular segment, which makes pipes, especially for the oil and gas industry. However, he said the company expects a decline in fourth quarter results mainly due to softening demand and prices for flat-rolled products in North America and Europe. "The volatile global economic climate is having significant negative effects on our business and our forward view is limited because of low order backlogs and short leadtimes," he said. "We expect to continue to operate at reduced production levels, corresponding with customer order rates," Surma said. Worldwide steel prices soared nearly 50 percent in the first half of this year on strong demand from China and other developing countries. But since then prices have fallen, and some steelmakers have cut production. U.S. Steel's stock, which was at a 52-week high of $196.00 on June 24, was up at $32.00 in premarket trading on Tuesday, after closing on Monday at $30.82.
