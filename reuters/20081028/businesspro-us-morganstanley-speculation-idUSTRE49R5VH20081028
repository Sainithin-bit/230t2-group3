 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ) on Tuesday, slammed by market speculation that the bank had suffered losses related to hedge fund Citadel Investment Group and to automaker Volkswagen, on Tuesday said it had "virtually no exposure." 

 Spokesman Mark Lake, knocking down rumors that had pushed its shares down 11 percent Tuesday, said the New York bank did not bear any exposure to either company. Morgan does not even currently have a prime brokerage exposure to Chicago-based Citadel, he said. "We have virtually no exposure to Volkswagen or to Citadel," Lake said. (Reporting by Joe Giannone)
