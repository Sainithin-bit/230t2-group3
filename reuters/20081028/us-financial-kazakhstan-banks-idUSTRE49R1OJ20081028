 ASTANA  (Reuters) - Kazakhstan offered to inject up to $5 billion into the former Soviet state's four largest banks on Tuesday to defend its financial sector against the global credit crunch. 

 Kazakh banks have been hit hard by the global liquidity squeeze after years of rapid growth fueled by external borrowing. Analysts say that boosting banks' capital would be one of the best ways to improve investor confidence. The government said in a statement it had advised the four banks -- Kazkommerts, Halyk, Alliance and BTA -- to issue new shares for a total of $5 billion. "Existing shareholders will have priority in purchasing the newly issued common and preferred shares," it said. After banks' shareholders make their own investments, the government will buy the remaining stock -- up to 25 percent in each of the four banks. It said it would also discuss potential injections with Italy's Unicredit, the majority shareholder of No.5 bank ATF-Bank, and South Korea's Kookmin, a shareholder of sixth-largest bank CenterCredit. The proposed injections are part of a $15 billion package announced last week to help the financial sector and the wider economy deal with the global financial turmoil. Another $5 billion will be disbursed by the state-run SamrukKazyna fund as loans to key industrial companies and small businesses, the government said. The last $5 billion is due to come from the relaxed minimum reserve requirements for banks and a $1 billion distressed asset fund. The central bank, which discussed the new reserve requirements last Friday, is yet to announce its decision. The government said it would also provide additional liquidity to the banks to help them repay foreign debt. The central bank estimates next year's total repayments at $12 billion -- the same figure as this year. But it has warned that refinancing, widely used by the banks this year, may no longer be available.
