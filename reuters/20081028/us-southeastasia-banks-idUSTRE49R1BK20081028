 SINGAPORE  (Reuters) - Volatile financial markets, which have hit capital raising and fee income, are expected to hurt quarterly profits of banks in Singapore and Malaysia, and the outlook is bleak as Asia braces for an economic slowdown. 

 Banks in Singapore led by DBS Group, Southeast Asia's biggest by assets, could also suffer from write-downs linked to complex derivatives and lower wealth management fees as market turmoil prompted investors to shun risky assets. "The macro environment in the region is the toughest since the Asian crisis, which incidentally is also the last point of reference for the sector and the economy undergoing major stress," said Harsh Wardhan Modi, an analyst at JPMorgan. But he said despite near-term risks, Singapore banks may be able to deliver better results than other Asian banks over the long term because banks will remain a primary source of funding for corporates as other avenues dry up. Singapore bank loans grew 25 percent in the first two months of the third quarter from the same period a year earlier, central bank data showed, but lenders have warned of slower growth in the months ahead as the risk of a global recession rises. Credit Suisse said in a note that Singapore banks could increase general provisions on loans and account for losses on products linked to collapsed investment bank Lehman Brothers. DBS said last week it would spend up to S$80 million ($53 million) to compensate some investors who bought structured products linked to Lehman Brothers. It sold S$360 million worth of Lehman-linked notes to investors in Singapore and Hong Kong. The sale of these products has raised an outcry in Singapore and Hong Kong, where hundreds of protesters staged rallies, forcing some banks to buy back these risky products from some investors. "Selling complex financial products to unsophisticated retail investors is generally lucrative and banks find it difficult to resist despite the franchise risks," said Matthew Wilson, an analyst at Morgan Stanley. "We have always viewed this strategy as aggressive and risky -- sales often end in tears when markets turn, customers lose money and allegations of mis-selling surface." Thai banks kicked off the earnings season earlier this month, with Bangkok Bank, the country's biggest bank, reporting a 16 percent fall in third-quarter net profit, hurt by losses on an investment in Lehman bonds. Analysts in Malaysia do not provide quarterly forecasts, but Malaysian bank earnings are expected to fall largely due to deteriorating capital market conditions. Profitability at leading lender Maybank may also be affected by the higher cost of borrowing, as it needs to raise funds to maintain capital adequacy ratios, analysts said. Sue Lin Lim, analyst at Hwang-DBS Vickers, expected Maybank to raise up to 11 billion ringgit ($3 billion) to fund its three acquisitions -- Vietnam's An Binh Bank, Pakistan's MCB Bank, and Bank Internasional Indonesia. "We assumed borrowing costs of 7 percent for the 11 billion ringgit Maybank would need to raise for the acquisitions to preserve capital at current levels," Lim said. "With that, our FY09-11 earnings are reduced by 11-12 percent," she said, adding there may be risk of an even bigger slide in earnings given the current market situation. Citigroup said in a report that as global financial conditions deteriorate, Malaysian banks will not be spared because of higher credit costs. It also cut its earnings forecasts for the Malaysian banking sector by 4-18 percent. 's financial year ends in December 2008.
