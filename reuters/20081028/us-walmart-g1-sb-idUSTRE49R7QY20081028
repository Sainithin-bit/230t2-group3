 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc ( WMT.N ) plans to sell the G1 cell phone, powered by Google Inc ( GOOG.O ), for about $30 less than T-Mobile USA, the exclusive U.S. carrier for the device. 

 Wal-Mart said it would start selling the touch-screen phone for $148.88 on Wednesday October 29 in about 550 stores for consumers who sign up for a two-year T-Mobile USA contract, and as more phones become available it will expand further. T-Mobile USA, the No. 4 U.S. mobile service, last week kicked off sales of the device, which is made by HTC Corp ( 2498.TW ), for $179. Wal-Mart spokeswoman Melissa O'Brien said on Tuesday that the company wanted to offer its customers the "products they want at the very best value." A spokesman for T-Mobile USA, a unit of Deutsche Telekom AG ( DTEGn.DE ). was not immediately available for comment.
