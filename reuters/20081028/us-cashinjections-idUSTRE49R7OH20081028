 (Reuters) - More and more U.S. banks are signing up for the government's offer of a cash injection, in addition to the nine that joined the program initially. The injections are a bid to revive the sector, which has suffered since lending has dried up and many loans have gone bad. 

 The U.S. Treasury Department plans to provide funds for 20 to 22 lenders in the current round of the $250 billion bank recapitalization program. Nine of the largest U.S. banks were the first to join the program and will receive the first $125 billion of capital infusions: Bank of America ( BAC.N )/Merrill Lynch MER.N $25 billion Citigroup ( C.N ) $25 billion JPMorgan Chase & Co ( JPM.N ) $25 billion Wells Fargo & Co ( WFC.N ) $25 billion Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ) $10 billion Goldman Sachs Group ( GS.N ) $10 billion Bank of New York Mellon Corp ( BK.N ) $3 billion State Street Corp ( STT.N ) $2 billion Total $125 billion Since October 24, the following banks have said they will take part in the program: PNC Financial Services Group Inc ( PNC.N ) $7.7 billion Capital One Financial Corp ( COF.N ) $3.55 billion Regions Financial Corp ( RF.N ) $3.5 billion SunTrust Banks Inc ( STI.N ) $3.5 billion Fifth Third Bancorp ( FITB.O ) $3.45 billion BB&T Corp ( BBT.N ) $3.1 billion KeyCorp ( KEY.N ) $2.5 billion Comerica ( CMA.N ) $2.25 billion Marshall & Ilsley Corp MI.N $1.7 billion Northern Trust Corp ( NTRS.O ) $1.5 billion Huntington Bancshares ( HBAN.O ) $1.4 billion Zions Bancorp ( ZION.O ) $1.4 billion First Horizon National Corp ( FHN.N ) $866 million City National Corp ( CYN.N ) $395 million Valley National Bancorp ( VLY.N ) $330 million UCBH Holdings Inc UCBH.O $298 million Umpqua Holdings Corp ( UMPQ.O ) $214 million Washington Federal WFSL.O $200 million First Niagara Financial Group ( FNFG.O ) $186 million HF Financial Corp ( HFFC.O ) $25 million Bank of Commerce ( BOCH.O ) $17 million Total $38.08 billion NOTE: Old National Bancorp ONB.N said it has won preliminary approval for $150 million but has not decided whether to participate. Provident Bankshares Corp, the parent of Baltimore-based Provident Bank, also said it has been given preliminary approval but has not decided whether to participate. West Bancorp ( WTBA.O ) said on Friday it was seeking shareholder approval to raise between $12 million and $36 million under the Treasury program. FirstMerit Corp ( FMER.O ) said on Tuesday it was deciding whether to participate. Paul Greig, chief executive, said he expects the Treasury's investment in FirstMerit would be $80 million to $250 million.
