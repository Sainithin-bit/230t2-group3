 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc ( WMT.N ) executives still expect the company to post sales growth through next year and gain market share, even as they cut spending plans to weather what could be a deep global recession. 

 The world's largest retailer said on Tuesday that sales growth this year would be at the high end of its earlier expectations. It expects growth next year to be roughly in line with previous forecasts. The forecasts made at its annual analyst meeting take into account the recent financial markets crisis and credit crunch. Wal-Mart shares jumped 11 percent to close at $55.10 in a broad market rally. "In a time of great economic uncertainty, this company is well positioned to succeed in the future and in the short term," said Chief Executive Officer Lee Scott at the company's meeting with analysts, which was broadcast over the Internet. He said the retailer has a strong belief it would emerge as a "tougher" competitor when the economy rebounds. To manage the downturn, Wal-Mart has cut capital spending plans for this year and next. It is pulling back on opening big new stores in the United States and will instead remodel existing locations or open smaller stores across the globe. "Remodels are taking center stage," Eduardo Castro-Wright, head of Wal-Mart's U.S. division, said on Monday. Wal-Mart Chief Financial Officer Tom Schoewe said on Tuesday the retailer's total capital spending for the current fiscal year ending January 31 is projected to be about $13 billion, down from roughly $14.9 billion last year. He forecast sales growth of 8 percent this year and 5 to 7 percent next fiscal year. It previously told analysts it expected growth of 5 to 8 percent in each of those years. "Wal-Mart seems to have the right model at the right time," said Sarah Henry, an analyst with MFC Global Investment Management, which owns Wal-Mart shares. "Shoppers are shopping on value overwhelmingly and I think that is what Wal-Mart really owns at this point." BUILDING ON PULLBACK Wal-Mart is building on efforts begun two years ago to jump-start U.S. sales by curbing expansion plans and focusing on improving results at existing stores. Shoppers headed to Wal-Mart are now finding wider aisles, reduced clutter and an expanded selection of popular products, such as pet care items and fresh food. Wal-Mart added 191 supercenters in the United States last year. It now plans to open 166 this year and 125 to 140 next year. Supercenters are vast stores that combine a full grocery store with a discount store, but the retailer said it has designed smaller centers that are more efficient. Wal-Mart's Sam's Club unit is also pulling back on new stores to focus on remodeling stores and testing new formats. Doug McMillon, head of Sam's Club, said the warehouse club operator expects to double the number of locations it will remodel in the next year. To appeal to Hispanic shoppers, Sam's Club said it will open a new club, called Mas Club, in Houston in the first half of 2009. The location will have an expanded selection of products from Mexico. Sam's Club also said it has opened a smaller store in Kansas to see if it can develop a new prototype that would work well in smaller markets. Sam's Club forecast capital expenditures of $800 million to $1 billion this year and spending of $700 million to $1 billion the next year. Last year, spending was $700 million. It will put $400 million to $500 million toward store remodeling projects this year and next year, up from $300 million last year. INTERNATIONAL NOT IMMUNE Wal-Mart said its international business, which last year accounted for 24 percent of the company's $374.53 billion in net sales, is not immune from the tough economic conditions. "These are difficult times, not just in the United States but around the world," said Mike Duke, vice chairman of Wal- Mart's international division. Duke said the retailer will be changing how it allocates capital to favor emerging markets with high growth potential. In the past five years, Wal-Mart has allocated roughly 67 percent of the capital in its international division toward mature markets, such as Canada and Japan. But over the next five years, it will allocate roughly 47 percent toward mature markets and 53 percent for emerging markets such as Mexico, China and Brazil. "We are building smaller stores and we're building stores that require less capital to enter a market," Duke said. Wal-Mart expects total international capital expenditures for its current fiscal year, which ends in early 2009, of $4.5 billion to $4.8 billion, and $4.8 billion to $5.3 billion next year. Last year, international capital spending was $4.6 billion. (Reporting by Nicole Maestri; Editing by  Richard Chang  and  Andre Grenon )
