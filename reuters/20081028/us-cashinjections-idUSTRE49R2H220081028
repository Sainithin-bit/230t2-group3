 (Reuters) - Twenty U.S. banks have signed up for the 

 government's offer of a cash injection, in addition to the nine that joined the program initially. The injections are a bid to revive the sector, which has suffered since lending has dried up and many loans have gone bad. The U.S. Treasury Department plans to provide funds for 20 to 22 lenders in the current round of the $250 billion bank recapitalization program. Nine of the largest U.S. banks said they will receive the first $125 billion of capital infusions two weeks ago: Bank of America/Merrill Lynch $25 billion Citigroup                               $25 billion JPMorgan Chase & Co                   $25 billion Wells Fargo & Co                      $25 billion Morgan Stanley                         $10 billion Goldman Sachs Group                    $10 billion Bank of New York Mellon Corp           $3 billion State Street Corp                     $2 billion
