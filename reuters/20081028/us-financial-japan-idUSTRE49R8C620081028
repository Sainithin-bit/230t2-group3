 TOKYO  (Reuters) - The Bank of Japan is considering cutting interest rates by a quarter-percentage point to shore up a sagging economy  battered by a strong yen and declining equity prices, the Nikkei business newspaper reported on Wednesday. 

 The central bank is leaning toward cutting its 0.5 percent target rate for the unsecured overnight call money rate to 0.25 percent when it meets on Friday, taking into account market conditions and other economic issues, the Nikkei said without citing sources. Japan's benchmark Nikkei share average has fallen to a 26-year low this week and has lost more than 50 percent since the start of the year. This could pressure Japan's financial system -- so far widely seen as in much better shape than those of the United States and Europe -- because the country's banks hold lots of Japanese shares. The yen's rise to a 13-year high late last week also fueled concern that Japanese export industries, the leading engine of the economy, will falter as a strong yen further saps their competitiveness at a time when global demand is already slowing sharply. The yen slid further after the report, posting its biggest percentage fall versus the dollar since 1974, tumbling more than 5 percent. Nikkei futures, on the other hand, hit their daily limit high in U.S. trade. The BOJ's policy meeting will come two days after the U.S. Federal Reserve's rate-setting decision, where a cut of at least 50 basis points from the current 1.5 percent target is widely expected. Some economists are concerned that Japanese industrial production data, due at 8:50 a.m. on Wednesday (2350 GMT, Tuesday), may provide yet more evidence that Japanese manufacturers' production is losing steam. Output is seen rising 0.5 percent in September, largely in reaction to a 3.5 percent decline in August. But manufacturers' projections for output in October and November are likely to give a sense of how cautious Japanese companies are becoming. The Nikkei report said the BOJ's half-yearly Outlook for Economic Activity and Prices, also due on Friday, is expected to include a downgrade in the economic growth rate projection for fiscal 2008/09 to nearly zero percent from 1.2 percent. The BOJ is also likely to cut its growth forecast for fiscal 2009/10 to 0.5-1 percent from a previous estimate of 1.5 percent, the newspaper reported. The BOJ has said the economy will stagnate until early 2009 but it will gradually recovery to moderate growth.
