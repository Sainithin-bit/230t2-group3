 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - High oil prices and improved refinery margins helped lift energy company earnings in the third quarter, but top U.S. refiner Valero Energy Corp said it would cut spending on expectations that demand will lag in the coming months. 

 The move by Valero was the latest sign that the global economic slowdown and declining energy prices would force companies in the sector to rein in spending. British major BP Plc ( BP.L ) posted a record profit of $10 billion for the quarter, beating analysts' forecasts, as crude oil prices peaked at above $147 a barrel in July before dropping sharply. That decline in oil prices helped earnings in BP's troubled refinery operations, which saw a more than five-fold increase in profits from a year earlier. Valero ( VLO.N ) also benefited as margins widened from the pullback in crude oil prices, as well as the hurricane-related shutdowns on the Gulf Coast, but said it was preparing for a downturn. "Given the uncertain economic environment, we have significantly reduced our capital spending," Bill Klesse, Valero's chairman and chief executive, said in a statement. The San Antonio, Texas-based company said it would cut 2008 spending by $800 million to $3 billion. Valero had originally expected to spend $4.5 billion this year. It also trimmed its 2009 spending forecast by $500 million to $3.5 billion. Occidental Petroleum's ( OXY.N ) earnings jumped more than 70 percent to $2.27 billion, topping forecasts, as its output grew, helping the Los Angeles-based company take advantage of the high oil and gas prices. In London, Paolo Scaroni, the chief executive of Italian oil company Eni ( ENI.MI ), sounded a cautionary note, telling reporters at an oil conference that companies had probably seen the end of record profits because of the more than 50 percent drop in oil prices since July. BP's shares were up nearly 7 percent on the London Stock Exchange, while Occidental rose 7.2 percent and Valero 12.5 percent on the New York Stock Exchange. PANIC OVER REASON The Standard & Poor's index of U.S. energy companies .GSPE has tumbled nearly 50 percent from July through Monday's close, hurt by selloff that has sliced more than 50 percent from oil and natural gas prices since then. But oilfield services company Smith International SII.N said investors and the industry were overlooking the strong global supply and demand picture. "Looking toward 2009, we feel the negative investment sentiment toward the oil and oil service industry is characteristic of panic rather than reason," Chief Executive Doug Rock, said in a statement. Rock noted that oil prices at $60 per barrel are more than six times their 1998 low point and natural gas prices are nearly three and a half times their 1998 low point. "There's plenty of profit potential at today's industry price structure, which is why capital will continue to flow into the oil and gas industry in proportionate and available quantities." Smith also beat analysts' estimates by reporting a 26 percent jump in earnings, helped by its acquisition of W-H Energy Services. That lifted its shares 6.6 percent in New York.
