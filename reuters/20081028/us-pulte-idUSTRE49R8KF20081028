 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Pulte Homes Inc ( PHM.N ) founder and Chairman William Pulte recently sold 760,000 shares of the company's stock to satisfy margin calls and could be forced to sell more, the company said on Tuesday. 

 The margin calls related to loan agreements that involved family members and a charitable organization. "I never intended to sell these shares, and I am very disappointed I had to at this time," William Pulte said in a statement. William Pulte joins a long list of other companies' executives who have been forced to sell shares to satisfy margin calls. A margin call occurs when the value of shares in an investor's portfolio falls, and he or she has to put up more cash as collateral or liquidate part of the portfolio to pay back the loan. Some of the other executives who have made similar recent sales include: Aubrey McClendon, chief executive of energy company Chesapeake Energy Corp ( CHK.N ); Pete Nicholas and John Abele, co-founders of medical device maker Boston Scientific Corp ( BSX.N ); Brian O'Hara, chairman of insurer XL Capital Ltd ( XL.N ); and Howard Lester, chief executive of retailer Williams-Sonoma Inc ( WSM.N ). Some executives borrow against their portfolios to access cash without having to sell shares, while others use money borrowed against their portfolio to add to their holdings. More than 30 companies so far in October have reported forced insider share sales due to margin calls, according to InsiderScore, which tracks insider activity. The sales usually have compounded a company's stock decline. (Reporting by  Ilaina Jonas ; editing by Susan Kelly)
