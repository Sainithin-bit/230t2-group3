 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury Department faces huge borrowing needs this year to finance multiple programs the government is running to try to restore stability to severely strained markets, a top U.S. Treasury official said on Tuesday. 

 "This year's financing needs will be unprecedented," Treasury's acting under secretary for domestic finance, Anthony Ryan, said in prepared remarks for delivery to the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, also known as SIFMA. Ryan said he was confident that investors value and will pay a premium for Treasury's predictable auctions and liquidity. To enhance funding flexibility, the Treasury may issue more longer-dated cash management bills and reinstate its three-year note program as early as November, he said. "To the very best of our ability, we intend to stay the course," he said. Ryan said not only was Treasury dealing with many policy objectives, including getting the Troubled Asset Relief Program going, but the fiscal 2009 budget deficit was forecast at $482 billion and that must be financed. "The potential for deterioration in economic conditions, given the contraction in credit, may also affect budget conditions this year," he noted. SEEKS PRIVATE-SECTOR SOLUTIONS Ryan asked for private-sector help in dealing with issues like market fails, in which one party does not deliver securities that have been bid on in a timely manner -- something that has increased this year. "We all benefit from a deep, liquid Treasury market, and SIFMA and the Treasury Markets Practices Group have the opportunity to take a leadership role in devising and implementing private-sector solutions to current challenges," Ryan said. He said equity, credit and funding markets all were under "considerable strain" as banks continue to deleverage and the appetite for risk diminishes. Stresses on U.S. and global markets remain "the most serious in recent memory," Ryan added. Unexpected stress has recently hit the $3 trillion market for federal agency debt, where money has been raised globally for the U.S. housing market. Borrowing costs for Fannie Mae FNM.NFNM.P and Freddie Mac FRE.NFRE.P, the two largest providers of money for housing, have soared to records over the past two weeks, largely due to unintended effects of a federal plan that will make some bank debt a safer bet for investors, analysts said. Ryan reiterated that the debt of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac was "effectively" guaranteed when their regulator put the companies in conservatorship in September.
