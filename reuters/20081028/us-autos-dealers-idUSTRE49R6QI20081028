 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Auto retailers swung to quarterly losses in the third quarter, beaten down by the decline in U.S. car sales, tight consumer credit, and a weakening U.S. economy as well as hurricane-related damages. 

 But shares rose sharply on Tuesday for Group 1 Automotive Inc ( GPI.N ) and Sonic Automotive Inc ( SAH.N ) after they laid out programs to cut costs and conserve cash. Lithia Motors Inc ( LAD.N ) shares also rose after it announced more cost cutting. Sonic, the No. 3 U.S. auto retailer, said on Tuesday that it had stopped various planned showroom-related projects, while Group 1 said it would slash capital spending and detailed a cost-cutting plan to save $35 million on an annualized basis. And Lithia said it had added to store divestiture plans and identified more cost cuts to cope with the sales downturn. Also supporting the shares of auto dealers and U.S. automakers, was a broad stock market rally as investors snapped up beaten-down shares and bet that credit markets would thaw. Group 1, the No. 4 U.S. retailer by sales, said it suspended its 2008 full-year outlook because of the economic volatility in the United States, but forecast a "substantial" drop in near-term revenue. The company also warned that additional cost-cutting actions may be needed, and lowered its acquisition target for the year. Group 1 said it began cutting costs this month, including personnel reductions, which are expected to produce annual savings of $21 million, and decreased advertising spending, expected to save $11 million a year. Economic weakness has driven U.S. light-vehicle sales to near 15-year lows through September and indications are that October is as bad or worse due to a drop in consumer confidence. LENDING STANDARDS TIGHTEN Group 1 Chief Executive Earl Hesterberg told a conference call with analysts that the global financial crisis, which had hurt consumer confidence and curbed financing for car buyers, had hurt showroom traffic in the latest quarter. He said some lenders were turning down loan applications, and higher down payments and interest rates were making other customers reject the financing being offered. Group 1 operates in the United States and the UK. The UK market accounts for 1.7 percent of its new vehicle unit sales. Group 1 posted a net loss of $20.6 million, or 91 cents per share, compared with earnings of $20.8 million, or 90 cents per share, a year earlier. Income from continuing operations was 42 cents per share, one cent higher than analysts' average expectations. Sonic Automotive, which operates only in the United States, posted a loss of $25.3 million, or 57 cents per share during the quarter, compared with a profit of $26.1 million, or 58 cents, a year ago. The company lost 24 cents per share from continuing operations. Revenue fell nearly 16 percent to $1.78 billion. Sonic now estimates it will earn 10 cents to 20 cents per share from continuing operations in the fourth quarter. Lithia reported a net loss of $2.4 million, or 12 cents per share, in the third quarter compared with net income of $11.2 million, or 53 cents per share, a year earlier. Total revenue fell 19.6 percent to $563.2 million. Excluding one-time items, Lithia earned 9 cents per share, a cent below analysts' average expectation. Lithia, which has been selling some stores, and cutting jobs to deal with the U.S. auto industry sales downturn, said it had added to the number of stores it expected to divest and identified additional cost cuts. Group 1 shares rose 8.7 percent to close at $6.14 on the New York Stock Exchange, after going as high as $6.91 earlier on Tuesday. Sonic shares soared 36 percent to $2.75 on the NYSE after setting an intraday high of $3.10. Lithia shares rose 11 percent to $1.78 in extended trading, after posting its results, up from a $1.60 close on the NYSE.
