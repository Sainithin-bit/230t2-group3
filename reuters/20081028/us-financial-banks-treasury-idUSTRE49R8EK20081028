 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury Department met with privately held banks on Tuesday to discuss ways they could get access to funds from the government's $700 billion financial rescue program, a source briefed on the matter told Reuters. 

 A Treasury Department spokeswoman declined to comment directly, saying Treasury officials have indicated they intend to include privately held banks in the federal rescue. On October 23, Neel Kashkari, Treasury's interim manager for the rescue program, told a congressional hearing the department was "working hard to finalize and publish the required legal documents so private banks can participate as well on the same economic terms as public banks."
