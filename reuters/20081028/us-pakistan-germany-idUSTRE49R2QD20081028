 ISLAMABAD  (Reuters) - Germany said on Tuesday it would help Pakistan in negotiating a deal with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and hoped an agreement could be reached soon to help Pakistan out of its economic difficulties. 

 Pakistan is facing a balance-of-payments crisis and has just a few weeks to raise billions of dollars in foreign loans needed to meet debt payments and pay for imports. Islamabad's 7-month-old government, running Pakistan after more than eight years under former army chief Pervez Musharraf, has been reluctant to go to the IMF and has been looking for help from friendly governments. But little assistance has materialized. Visiting German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier held talks on Tuesday with Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari and Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi and said both had told him Pakistan would not be able to move ahead without IMF involvement. Steinmeier said an agreement on help for Pakistan was needed within days. "I hope the decision will be taken soon. It won't help to have it in six months, or six weeks. Rather, we need it in the coming six days," Steinmeier said at a joint news conference conference with his Pakistani counterpart. With donors caught up with their own problems brought on by the global financial crisis, they would apparently prefer to wait for IMF involvement which would bring discipline by attaching conditions and targets, analysts say. Pakistan has yet to formally ask the IMF for a facility but an IMF spokesman said on Friday talks going on in Dubai between the fund and Pakistani officials would enable the fund to respond swiftly should a request be made. Steinmeier said Germany was ready to help. "We will support your country in the negotiations with the IMF," he said. "FRIENDS" SEEN WAITING Steinmeier, who will be traveling to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates later this week, has said he wants to use his trip to prepare a meeting of the "Friends of Pakistan" group in Abu Dhabi next month. The group, launched on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly in New York last month, includes the United States, the European Union, the UAE, the United Nations and China. Analysts say group members expect Pakistan to come to a deal with the IMF before they will make concrete offers. Steinmeier signaled a similar stance on Tuesday, when he was quoted as telling Pakistan's The News newspaper the Friends group could be no "all-purpose tool." Steinmeier told the news conference Germany would be ready to step up development assistance to Pakistan but he declined to give a figure. Steinmeier also said he hoped a meeting of political and tribal leaders from Afghanistan and Pakistan would calm tension on the border between the uneasy neighbors. Surging violence in Afghanistan has strained ties between the Western allies, with Afghanistan complaining Pakistan has not done enough to stop Taliban infiltrating from sanctuaries in its northwestern ethnic Pashtun lands. The leaders, meeting in Islamabad, are due to wind up two days of talks on ways to end the violence later on Tuesday. "We hope that this process is going to be continued because we hope that this process will help in calming the situation at the border," Steinmeier said. Germany has about 3,500 soldiers in Afghanistan. The German parliament voted this month to extend Germany's participation in a NATO peacekeeping mission there and to increase the number of troops it can send to 4,500, despite public misgivings about the mission.
