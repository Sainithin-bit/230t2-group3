 (Reuters) - Following are coming events linked to the debt crisis in the euro zone: 
 EUROPEAN UNION: November 29 - Meeting of euro zone finance ministers in Brussels to try to finalize plans to leverage the euro zone rescue fund to provide first-loss insurance on troubled states' government bonds and attract foreign investors to buy euro zone debt. November 30 - Meeting of EU finance ministers in Brussels. Discussions expected to include bank recapitalization plans. December 7-8 - Congress of center-right European People's Party, the largest grouping in the European Parliament, to be held in Marseille, France. Expected to be attended by German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Nicolas Sarkozy, among other party leaders. December 8 - ECB Governing Council meeting to consider whether to cut interest rates again from 1.25 percent, and whether to take bolder action to stabilize the euro zone bond market. December 9 - Summit of EU heads of state and government in Brussels. 2012 March 1-2 - Summit of EU heads of state and government in Brussels. May 25 - Summit of EU heads of state and government in Brussels. GREECE: POLITICS: -- Greece is awaiting the disbursement of an 8 billion euro tranche under its first bailout as it faces bond redemptions by the middle of December. -- Private and public sector unions GSEE and ADEDY, representing about half the country's 4 million workforce, will strike against austerity, on December 1. GOVERNMENT DEBT SUPPLY: -- Greece's debt agency needs to roll over a total of 4.0 billion euros of T-bills in December: 2 billion euros of 6-month paper mature on December 16 and 2 billion in 3-month T-bills mature on December 23. -- Greece also has 2.7 billion euros of bonds maturing in December: 1.17 billion due on December 19, 980 million on December 22, and 715 million on December 30. DATA: -- November 29 - PPI for October -- November 30 - Retail sales for September ITALY: -- Prime Minister Mario Monti, who has outlined a broad raft of policy priorities, will be trying to quickly translate them into concrete reform proposals with one eye on Italy's perilously high bond yields. -- Monti has already met with European Council President Herman Van Rompuy, EU Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso and German and French leaders Angela Merkel and Nicolas Sarkozy. -- He reiterated Italy's commitment to balancing its budget in 2013 and made clear that Italy wants to be an active player in the eventual creation of a European fiscal union. -- Italy is firmly at the heart of the escalating euro zone debt crisis and it is already clear that the exit of former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi was no quick fix to the country's woes. -- Ten-year bond yields rose back above 7 percent on Thursday, a level generally seen as untenable, while the spread against safer German bunds climbed back above 500 basis points. POLITICS: -- Pensions, job protection rules and taxes are among areas where Monti will be working on reform, but his first task will probably be to adopt new deficit cutting steps to respond to Italy's rising borrowing costs and flagging economic growth.

PORTUGAL: -- Portugal, bailed out to the tune of 78 billion euros, has admitted its accounts fell short of expectations in the first half of the year but said it would meet this year's target agreed with its lenders using extraordinary, one-off measures. -- The troika of lenders said on November 16 it was satisfied with Portugal's performance under the bailout, but told it to avoid relying on one-off measures in the future and to deliver on structural reforms. -- Portugal's economy is expected to contract sharply this year and next, only returning to growth in 2013 as the government enacts tough spending cuts and across-the-board tax hikes.
