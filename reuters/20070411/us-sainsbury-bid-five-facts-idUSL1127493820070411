 (Reuters) - Private equity group CVC Capital CVC.UL dropped its plans to bid for J. Sainsbury ( SBRY.L ) on Wednesday after the supermarket chain's founding family frustrated a proposed 10.1 billion pound ($20 billion) offer. 

 Here are five facts about Sainsbury, Britain's third largest supermarket chain and one of its best-known retail brands. * Founded by John James and May Ann Sainsbury in 1869 on London's Drury Lane. * Sainsbury reached its heyday in the 1980s and early 1990s, under the chairmanship of John Sainsbury, a descendent of the founder, when it was Britain's favorite grocer and its market value touched 11 billion pounds ($22 billion). * It had lost that crown by the late-1990s, slipping to a weak third place after Tesco ( TSCO.L ) and Asda ( WMT.N ) scooped up Sainsbury customers who were driven away by its badly-stocked stores and out-of-date brown store fronts. * Justin King, formerly head of food at Marks & Spencer ( MKS.L ), came to its rescue in 2004, staging one of British retail's most pronounced turnarounds. Store refits and a major advertising campaign fronted by celebrity chef Jamie Oliver has brought Sainsbury nearly level with Asda. King is on track to achieve his target of 2.5 billion pound increase in Sainsbury sales by 2008. * "Keep the shops well lit," were reported to be founder John James Sainsbury's dying words.
