 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Genentech Inc. DNA.N reported on Wednesday that first-quarter profit surged 68 percent, spurred by double-digit sales growth of its cancer medicine Avastin and solid, though somewhat disappointing, sales of its new eye disease drug Lucentis. 

 Sales of Lucentis, for age-related macular degeneration, were $211 million in just its third full quarter on the market, but that was $6 million short of the previous quarter. Analysts, whose estimates were crushed by the drug's performance in the previous two quarters, were looking for between $212 million and $220 million for this quarter. The world's second-largest biotechnology company posted a net profit of $706 million, or 66 cents per share, compared with a profit of $421 million, or 39 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, the South San Francisco, California-based company earned 74 cents per share, topping analysts' average estimates by 7 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. Genentech reiterated the 2007 forecast it gave last month, saying it expects earnings per share growth of 25 percent to 30 percent over 2006 levels. Operating revenue for the quarter rose 43 percent to $2.84 billion, topping Wall Street estimates of $2.75 billion. U.S. sales of Avastin, the colon cancer drug that is also being used to treat lung and breast cancers and has been Genentech's most important growth driver, jumped 34 percent to $533 million -- the high end of analysts' estimate of $520 million to $533 million. U.S. sales of Herceptin for breast cancer rose a modest 7 percent to $311 million, while U.S. sales of Rituxan for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and rheumatoid arthritis rose 12 percent to $535 million. Shares of Genentech, which is majority-owned by Roche Holding AG ( ROG.VX ), are up a little more than 2 percent in 2007 in what has been an up and down year for the stock. By comparison the broader American Stock Exchange Biotech Index .BTK is up about 5 percent this year.
