 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - With the unemployment rate at a five-month low, wage inflation is starting to worry financial markets and may become a problem for the Federal Reserve this year. 

 More than 150,000 new jobs have been created per month in four of the past five months in the U.S. and average hourly earnings rose 4.0 percent year-on-year to March, according to last week's employment report from the U.S. Labor Department. The news postponed investors' hopes for an interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve in coming months and lifted benchmark Treasury bond yields to near two-month highs. "The most immediate negative would be for the bond market, which automatically suffers from an inflation push," said Milton Ezrati, senior economist and market strategist with Lord Abbett in Jersey City, New Jersey. Long-dated bond prices are particularly vulnerable to rising inflation pressures, which erode bond values over time. "Wage inflation implies a stronger consumer and so the stock market would have an offset that the bond market does not," Ezrati said. "The bond market would fare worse." While rising remuneration for workers is not yet at levels that would force the Fed to raise interest rates, wage costs are already increasing enough to wave a cautionary flag to market analysts, who now believe that for a long while the Fed may be unable to cut interest rates to revive a slipping economy. In the fourth quarter 2006, unit labor costs rose 3.4 percent from the same quarter the year before, up from about 2.0 percent in 2005, says Jay Bryson, global economist at Wachovia Corp. in Charlotte, North Carolina. "That eventually could become a concern for the Fed," said Bryson. "In the current environment, I don't think it is so much of a concern that they raise rates, but it may prevent them from lowering rates sooner than they otherwise would," Bryson said. Fund managers are increasingly conscious that the threat of rising wage costs will spill over into the core inflation measures watched closely by the Federal Reserve when making monetary policy decisions. Most economists hold to the view that low unemployment and higher wages are lagging indicators which tend to happen at the tail end of a period of economic expansion, and so wage costs will be curbed once joblessness starts to rise as the economy slows. The big question for investors is how many months this will take. "We have started to see signs that wages are picking up and that you would expect to see when the job market is showing near full employment," said Neil Wolfson, president of Wilmington Trust Investment Management in New York. That prospect is one factor preventing Treasury bonds from rallying, for now, he said. "We expect that wages will continue to go up. It is obviously negative to companies whose profitability is based on these workers," Wolfson said. Yet some stock market analysts, although nervous about climbing labor costs, reckon U.S. wage rises will soon be capped, with little damage to stock markets. "Given the inordinately low unemployment rate in the U.S. there is a reason for some concern," says Ezrati. But cheaper labor costs in some other economies and an increasingly globalized market for workers should ultimately curb U.S. wages, he said. In addition, over the past several years "a lot of people have dropped out of the (U.S.) labor force and the Fed is confident, and me too, that were wages to rise, then they would re-enter the labor market," putting a lid on labor costs, he says. "The 4.4 percent jobless rate we got last Friday overstates the tightness of the labor market," Ezrati said. He expects unit labor costs to rise close to 2.5 percent over the next 12 to 18 months, which would still allow company profit margins to grow enough for stocks to outperform bonds. Over that same timeframe, Ezrati sees the S&P 500 index .SPX  rising above 1,550 points, a gain of some 7.0 percent from its 1,448 points closing level on Tuesday. He expects the benchmark 10-year Treasury note US10YT=RR to deliver returns of about 5.0 percent by comparison, with its yield fluctuating between about 4.75 percent and 5.25 percent, up from its current yield of around 4.71 percent.
