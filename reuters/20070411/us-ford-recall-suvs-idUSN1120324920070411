 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co. said on Wednesday it was recalling 527,000 Escape sport utility vehicles after receiving reports of engine fires linked to the anti-lock brake connectors. 

 The vehicles involved in the recall were from the model years 2001 to 2004, Ford spokeswoman Kristen Kinley said. The automaker is recalling 444,000 in the United States. The rest of the SUVs were sold in Europe, Mexico and Canada. The recall does not affect hybrid versions of the SUV, Kinley said. Water and contaminants can could enter the ABS connector and cause corrosion, which in some cases could lead to smoking or melting of the ABS connector, Kinley said. Also, the ABS warning light could come on, she added. Ford said there have been about 50 engine fires connected to the problem, but no accidents or injuries.
