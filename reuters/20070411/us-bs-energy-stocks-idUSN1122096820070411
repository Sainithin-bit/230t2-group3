 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. gasoline supplies fell for the ninth consecutive time last week, bringing inventories about 12 percent below where they were in early February and signaling higher prices, according to the U.S. government. 

 The dwindling gasoline stockpiles came amid a rash of refinery outages that have raised worries of a possible supply crunch this summer, when the nation's demand for motor fuel is expected to peak. Indeed, supply worries pushed U.S. gasoline futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange up 4.7 cents to $2.17 per gallon, their loftiest level in eight months, Wednesday morning. Commercial gasoline inventories dropped 5.5 million barrels to 199.7 million barrels in the week ended April 6, due in part to strong demand and a decline in imports, according to the weekly report from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. That was far more than the decline of 1.4 million barrels analysts had forecast in a Reuters survey. "A surprisingly massive gasoline inventory draw is likely to push up gasoline contract prices and prices at the pump," said Jason Schenker, an economist with Wachovia. "Gasoline imports were down, while demand remained just shy of the 9.5 million barrel per day level. With dynamics like these, $3 retail gasoline looks to be right around the corner," he said. During the same week, crude supplies rose 700,000 barrels to 333.4 million barrels. Inventories of distillate fuels, which include heating oil and diesel, rose 100,000 barrels to 118.1 million barrels, according to the EIA, the statistical arm of the Department of Energy. NYMEX crude oil futures CLc1 rose 54 cents to $62.43 per barrel after the data were issued. "I think the numbers do come out supportive, especially for gasoline with a much greater-than-expected draw," said Eric Wittenauer, an analyst at A.G. Edwards. Gasoline demand over the past four weeks averaged 9.36 million bpd, up around 2.5 percent from a year ago, according to the report. Meanwhile, weekly imports declined nearly half a million bpd to 953,000 bpd. Energy analysts had expected a slowdown in gasoline imports from Europe this month due to refinery maintenance. Refinery utilization rates in the United States recovered but remain below 90 percent. Refinery runs rose 1.4 percentage points to 88.4 percent of capacity, the EIA said. A separate report from the American Petroleum Institute showed crude stocks up 2.0 million barrels, gasoline supplies down 3.2 million barrels, and distillate stocks off 443,000 barrels.
