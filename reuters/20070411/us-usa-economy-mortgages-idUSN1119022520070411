 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. mortgage applications declined for the fourth straight week, as falling demand to refinance home loans outweighed a rise in applications to buy houses, an industry group said on Wednesday. 

 Borrowing costs increased for all loan types last week. The average rate on 30-year fixed-rate loans climbed to a six-week peak, reducing the incentive to refinance existing mortgages. A slow start to the spring sales season, and tighter lending standards due to the subprime mortgage crisis, could keep a lid on housing activity through most of the year, industry experts say. The Mortgage Bankers Association said its seasonally adjusted index of mortgage applications dipped 0.4 percent to 646.6 in the week ended Friday, April 6. Refinancing applications dropped for the fourth straight week, declining 4.0 percent to 2,015.0, its lowest level since mortgage rates reached their recent peak in late February. But the MBA's seasonally adjusted purchase index rose 2.7 percent to 413.8 last week. Applications to buy homes have been more choppy week to week than refinancings, though are generally trending higher. "Despite two months' worth of nothing but almost nonstop news of a meltdown in the subprime housing market, it suggests to me that at least the intention to buy either new or used homes in terms of people taking out applications has held in better than I would have expected," Stuart Hoffman, chief economist at PNC Financial Services Group in Pittsburgh, said of the purchase index. "Whether those applications ultimately get approved, that's another issue," he said. "I would think the approval rate is going to be a lot lower than it would have been a couple months ago." SPRING BLOOM? Mortgage rates are at a six-week high, but still well below levels reached a year ago. Thirty-year fixed home loan rates last week rose 0.03 percentage point to 6.16 percent, excluding fees, matching the rate of the February 23 week, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. Unless the job market and the economy slump, relatively low long-term borrowing costs could help spur a housing rebound late in the year, many economists say. Warmer spring weather typically brings buyers back to the market. This year, potential home purchasers will find a huge supply of unsold houses at prices perhaps much lower than the last time they shopped. Any big cracks in the spring sales season could delay a housing recovery already stalled by trouble in the subprime mortgage sector. Subprime mortgage lenders have tightened standards, making it more difficult for borrowers with weak credit to get home loans. "The spring housing season is key to the broader outlook and early indications appear weak," according to a Bank of America report this week. Second-half economic growth "depends crucially" on home sales in the second quarter, the firm said. Lighter shopper traffic than expected, downward price momentum and tighter lending standards suggest a soft March to kick off the spring selling season, the report said. On Tuesday, D.R. Horton Inc. ( DHI.N ), the largest U.S. home builder, said orders for new homes slumped 37 percent last quarter and the spring selling season has been slower than usual.  A cool spring and summer sales period could mean a deeper, longer housing recession, especially if subprime defaults and foreclosures grow, according to Hoffman. "The housing market is not going to drag the rest of the economy down, but it probably is going to prevent any sort of reacceleration of economic growth in spring or summer quarters, so we're grooved in this below-trend growth," he said. On a four-week moving average, which smooths out volatility, the MBA said its market and refinancing measures declined and the purchase index was little changed. On that basis, the seasonally adjusted market index was 1.6 percent lower at 659.8, the purchase index stood at 409.6 compared with 409.7, and the refinancing gauge was down 3.4 percent at 2,129.9.
