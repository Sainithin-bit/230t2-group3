 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Home furnishings retailer Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. ( BBBY.O ) said on Wednesday its quarterly profit rose 4 percent on higher sales at established stores. 

 Fourth-quarter net income totaled $205.8 million, or 72 cents a share, compared with $197.9 million, or 67 cents a share a year earlier. Quarterly sales increased to about $1.9 billion from $1.69 billion a year ago. Sales at stores open at least a year, a key retail measure known as same-store sales, were up 5.2 percent during the quarter, versus a 6.3 percent gain a year earlier. Analysts, on average, expected the Union, New Jersey-based retailer to earn 78 cents a share for the quarter, according to Reuters Estimates. Excluding special items, it said it earned 79 cents a share for the quarter. Bed Bath & Beyond has been a lone bright spot in a bleak home furnishings sector that has stumbled in the wake of a cool U.S. housing market and intense competition from discounters like Target Corp. ( TGT.N ) and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ( WMT.N ) Rival Pier 1 Imports Inc. ( PIR.N ) has endured more than a year of declining same-store sales and has posted seven consecutive quarterly losses. Last month, Williams-Sonoma Inc. ( WSM.N ) posted a higher profit due to cost-cutting measures and increased promotional activity, but issued a disappointing first-quarter earnings forecast, citing sectorwide pressures.
