 TORONTO  (Reuters) - Two prominent Canadian businessmen may make an offer for DaimlerChrysler's DCXGn.DE DCX.N Chrysler division, a national newspaper said on Wednesday. 

 The Globe and Mail, citing people familiar with the sales process, said Gerald Schwartz, head of buyout conglomerate Onex Corp. ( OCX.TO ), and Magna International's MGa.TO Frank Stronach are working on a joint bid for the automaker. The paper said the combination would match Magna's expertise in auto manufacturing operations with Onex's skill in financial operations, key to running Chrysler's finance arm. An Onex official did not return a call seeking comment. Some observers have questioned Magna's decision to pursue Chrysler, given that DaimlerChrysler has been unable to make the unit a success despite its experience in the auto business. "I don't see the evidence that Magna has the full skillset to manage Chrysler," Jennings Capital analyst Rich Morrow said on Wednesday, adding he has no information regarding Onex partnering with Magna on a bid. The offer price for the unit is unclear, the Globe said, but there have been suggestions that Chrysler has determined a price of at least $8 billion. The only offer that has been made public so far is a $4.5 billion cash offer from U.S. investor Kirk Kerkorian. Others believed to be considering a bid are private equity firms Blackstone Group LP and Cerberus Capital Management LP. ($1=$1.14 Canadian)
