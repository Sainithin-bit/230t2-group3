 MUMBAI  (Reuters) - India's Bharti Enterprises said on 
Wednesday it will sign a deal in April with Wal-Mart Stores 
Inc. ( WMT.N ) for a joint venture in cash-and-carry and back-end 
supply for its retail operations, nearly a month later than 
previously expected. 

  "The deal will be signed this month," a spokesman for the 
Indian firm said. He did not say why the deal was delayed.  Top executives from the U.S. giant had met Indian 
government officials early in March and Bharti Chairman Sunil 
Mittal had said at the time that the two firms were very close 
to a deal.  Bharti Retail Ltd., wholly-owned by Bharti Enterprises, has 
said it will spend $2.5 billion by 2015 on setting up 
hypermarkets, supermarkets and other stores across India.  The proposed entry of Wal-Mart in India's fragmented $300 
billion retail industry, which is dominated by small stores, 
has triggered political concerns and protests from trade unions 
and small shop owners who fear job losses.
