 LONDON  (Reuters) - Anglo-Swiss miner Xstrata Plc XTA.L said on Wednesday it was selling its aluminum business to private equity firm Apollo Management for $1.15 billion cash, raising funds that could help pay for a string of acquisitions. 

 Xstrata acquired the aluminum business through its purchase of Canadian miner Falconbridge last year and had been conducting a review to decide whether to use it as a platform to build a bigger aluminum operation or sell it. "Our review concluded that these assets do not provide Xstrata with the necessary scale or upstream exposure to represent a suitable entry point from which to build a world-class aluminum business," Chief Executive Mick Davis said in a statement. Xstrata, which mines copper, coking coal, thermal coal, ferrochrome, nickel, vanadium and zinc, said it expected the deal to complete in the second quarter of this year. From a small Swiss-domiciled producer of steel alloys known as Sudelektra Holding AG in the late 1990s, Xstrata has grown rapidly through a string of deals to challenge the world's big three miners -- BHP Billiton ( BHP.AX ) ( BLT.L ), Rio Tinto ( RIO.AX ) ( RIO.L ) and Anglo American ( AAL.L ) ( AGLJ.J ). As well as Falconbridge, Xstrata bought one third of Colombia's Cerrejon coal operation and Peru's Tintaya copper mine last year. Last month it agreed to buy Canadian nickel miner LionOre ( LIM.TO ) for $4 billion and on Tuesday it agreed to buy Australia's Gloucester Coal GCL.AX for $320 million. "The proceeds are in line with our expectations and cover roughly one-quarter of the expected cash outlay required for LionOre and Gloucester Coal," Investec analyst Nick Hatch said in a note. Shares in Xstrata were up 0.7 percent at 2,775 pence by 0735 GMT after hitting a record high of 2,814p. Numis Securities said the sale price represented an enterprise value of 4.8 times its 2007 estimate of earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization. "The sale to a private equity group is interesting as many market commentators believed the most likely buyer would be Century Aluminium, which jointly holds upstream assets with Falconbridge through a joint venture," it said.
