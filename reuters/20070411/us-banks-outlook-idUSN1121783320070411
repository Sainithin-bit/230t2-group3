 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Slow. Tired. Weak. Difficult. Challenging. Not words that investors like to hear. But it's what analysts are using to describe what to expect as major U.S. banks prepare to report first-quarter results next week. 

 "It's a very difficult operating environment right now," said Michael Nix, a portfolio manager at Greenwood Capital Associates LLC in Greenwood, South Carolina. Banks are struggling with narrowing lending margins, rising defaults and mortgage problems after the five-year housing boom ended and borrowers began missing more payments. Buffalo's M&T Bank Corp. ( MTB.N ) said all of these would hurt results. "It's a more challenging environment, especially for regional banks," said Mark Batty, an analyst at PNC Wealth Management in Philadelphia, which oversees $54 billion. "Net interest margin is likely to be soft or contract for banks in general." Offsetting such factors is expected growth in investment banking, including at Citigroup Inc. ( C.N ), Bank of America Corp. ( BAC.N ) and JPMorgan Chase & Co. ( JPM.N ). Thomson Financial said stock and bond underwriting set a record last quarter, while merger activity came close to a record. "Banks are looking tired," John McDonald, a Banc of America Securities LLC analyst who covers major banks other than his own, wrote on March 30. "Weaker earning asset growth, continued spread pressure (and) adverse seasonal factors are likely to offset a favorable capital markets environment." McDonald expected average earnings per share at 23 banks he covers to rise 4 percent from a year earlier and fall 6 percent from the fourth quarter. Lehman Brothers Inc. analyst Jason Goldberg said on March 29 that he expected a 5 percent gain and a 7 percent decrease for the respective periods at 26 banks he covers. Results are important for the broader stock market. Financial services stocks made up 21.6 percent of the Standard & Poor's 500 index's  .SPX  $12.7 trillion market value in the first quarter. The S&P Financials Index .GSPF trailed the broader index by 3.6 percentage points. COST CUTTING Wachovia Corp. WB.N and Citigroup will be first out of the gate, reporting quarterly results on Monday. The former is in the final year of a $1 billion cost-cutting drive. The latter on Wednesday set plans to eliminate 17,000 jobs in a bid to save $4.58 billion by 2009. Both banks also have big mortgage operations, as do Wells Fargo & Co. ( WFC.N ), JPMorgan and Bank of America, which respectively report results Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday. Investors will want assurance that subprime mortgage woes aren't spreading to lenders exposed to higher-quality loans. Some lenders are being hurt as risk-wary investors offer them low prices on near-prime-quality loans they want to sell. Washington Mutual Inc. ( WM.N ) has reduced mortgage risk after its home loan business lost money in 2006, but analysts are still looking for signs that expected credit losses, which the savings and loan increased in January, don't rise again. "Mortgages might be a significant headwind for Washington Mutual," Batty said. "Wells Fargo might not face a big problem because its underwriting standards have been good." Wells Fargo also "co-issues" many of its subprime loans, passing off credit risk to investment banks. Lori Appelbaum, a Goldman Sachs & Co. analyst, on March 26 said mortgage exposure may mean earnings estimates are too high for Washington Mutual, National City Corp. NCC.N and First Horizon National Corp. ( FHN.N ). She projected "slow top line" growth industrywide, with lending income unchanged to down, and "seasonally weak" deposit service charges. Nix said banks may set aside more for loan losses. "You might see banks beefing up their reserves in preparation for a slowing economy and more normal credit environment," he said. One possible saving grace: prospects for more bank mergers. "Buyers are continually paying up for deposits," CIBC World Markets Corp. analyst Meredith Whitney wrote on April 8. "We expect consolidation to continue through year-end."
