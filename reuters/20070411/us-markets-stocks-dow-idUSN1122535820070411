 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - With U.S. stocks sagging Wednesday afternoon, the Dow industrials appeared on track to close out their longest streak of gains in four years. Yet for all its historic length, the eight-day run didn't actually propel blue chips all that much higher. 

 The upward grind that began March 29 was more a leisurely jog than a sprint. It looks downright anemic when compared with rallies of similar length over the past 10 years. Take the last one, which ran from March 12 to March 21 in 2003. In that stretch, the Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  added nearly 1,000 points and finished the run 13.6 percent higher. It was punctuated by two 200-plus point sessions: A 269.68-point gain on March 13 that was followed four days later by a 282.21-point surge on March 17. This year's streak doesn't come anywhere close. Through Tuesday's close, the Dow average was up just 273.5 points over its run, or a modest 2.2 percent. Three of the eight sessions featured single-digit point gains and the group managed a triple-digit advance just once -- 128 points on April 3. This latest rally is the fourth eight-day run of gains the Dow has recorded since December 1996, and it is the weakest of the lot. The 2003 streak was far and away the strongest, followed by a December 1998 run, which added 530.4 points, or 6.03 percent, and then a December 1996 stretch, over which the Dow rose 292.6 points, or 4.67 percent. To technicians, who study past market trends to determine future moves, the sluggish pace of this latest streak underscores a lack of conviction in the attempt to recover to levels from before the market's sell-off on February 27. "There's nothing there that makes this run look like there was conviction at all in any of the measures -- point gains, volume, breadth, momentum. Nothing was there," said Marc Pado, U.S. market strategist and technical analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., in San Francisco. "These marginal gains that you saw meant nothing. You need to attack that old high with volume and breadth. That's how you get through. You just don't just tiptoe your way through an old high." On February 20, the Dow climbed to a lifetime high of 12,795.93. In 2003, the two weeks spanning the Dow's previous eight-day rally coincided with the start of the war in Iraq. Even so, that uncertainty caused some investors to scoop up beaten-down shares, propelling the stock market higher in the face of increasing hostility and geopolitical tensions. Should the Dow manage to turn positive by Wednesday's close, it would be the longest streak since a 10-day run in November 1996. In that run, the Dow added 326.1 points, or 5.42 percent, closing it out at a level of 6,348.03 on November 15, 1996. With less than an hour to go before Wednesday's closing bell, the Dow was down about 95 points at 12,478.77. In late afternoon trading, the blue-chip average fell more than 100 points after the minutes from the March meeting of the Federal Reserve's policy-making meeting indicated more interest-rate hikes may be needed to rein in inflation.
