 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - New York City is seeking a probe of Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ( WMT.N ) over the retailer's surveillance of shareholders who submitted proxy petitions, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday. 

 The New York City Comptroller asked the U.S. Attorney General's office and the Securities and Exchange Commission to investigate Wal-Mart for what it called "ill-considered and possibly illegal surveillance operations" directed at shareholders who submitted proposals that could potentially disrupt the company's annual meeting, the paper said. Comptroller William Thompson Jr.'s office and Wal-Mart officials could not immediately be reached for comment.
