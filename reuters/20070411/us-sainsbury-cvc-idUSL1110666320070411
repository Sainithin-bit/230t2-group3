 LONDON  (Reuters) - CVC Capital Partners CVC.UL ditched its plans to bid for Britain's J Sainsbury Plc ( SBRY.L ) on Wednesday, ending a nearly 10-week battle that pitted private equity against the supermarket group's founding family. 

 The proposed 10.1 billion pound ($20 billion) offer collapsed because of CVC's failure to broker an agreement with the Sainsbury family, owners of a nearly 20 percent stake, and trustees who demanded it fill a billion pound pension deficit. "After a number of discussions between the board of Sainsbury and the consortium, it became clear that the consortium would be unable to make a proposal that would result in a successful offer," CVC said in a statement. Former chief executive and life president John Sainsbury said in a statement he had opposed the bid because the large amount of debt would weaken the retailer in the longer term. Shares in Britain's third-biggest supermarket group closed down 2.3 percent at 530 pence following the announcement, still significantly higher than before CVC revealed its bid plans on February 2 when they stood at 410 pence. Analysts said the price reflected expectations management will now move to unlock value from its property portfolio and pay a special dividend or conduct a share buyback to stem pressure from shareholders frustrated by CVC's failure. Sainsbury's credit default swaps fell 35 basis points on the news to 55 basis points, a London trader said. A Sainsbury's spokesman declined to comment on British newspaper reports it had already begun a review that could lead to the property being revalued at 10 billion pounds, up from 7.5 billion pounds now. PROPERTY FOCUS Sainsbury said in a statement it was committed to completing its three-year recovery plan under Chief Executive Justin King, who is on track to achieve his target of a 2.5 billion pound increase in total sales by 2008. The retailer, founded in 1869, said bid talks had broken down because the board was unable to meet preconditions set by CVC and its partners Texas Pacific TPG.UL and Blackstone BG.UL, which pulled out of the consortium on Tuesday. The consortium wanted the board to persuade pension trustees to accept its 582 pence proposed bid without an assurance it would plug a pension deficit of as much as 1 billion pounds, a person familiar with the matter said. It also wanted management to negotiate with the Sainsbury family, which refused to accept a bid of less than 600 pence. Analysts said that while they did not expect another bid to emerge for the retailer, property tycoon Robert Tchenguiz, who amassed a nearly five percent stake when CVC's bid interest was revealed, could push for a sale of some real estate. Societe Generale's Tom Gadsby said in a note Sainsbury's situation now mirrored that of French supermarket group Carrefour ( CARR.PA ), where activist shareholders Colony Capital and Bernard Arnault are seeking a property sell off. A person familiar with the matter said Tchenguiz believes there is significantly more value to be released, principally from property, and he placed a higher value on Sainsbury than the consortium. Sainsbury trades at 38 times 2007 estimated earnings compared with 21 times for Tesco ( TSCO.L ) and 19 times for the DJ Stoxx index of European retailers .SXRP. CVC had until Friday to say publicly whether it was bidding for Sainsbury under a deadline set by the Takeover Panel, which forced the consortium to reveal it was considering the bid after market speculation pushed up the shares in February. The consortium members are now expected to turn their attention to continental Europe. Shares in Carrefour and Germany's Metro ( MEOG.DE ) have risen in recent weeks on speculation private equity is circling. (Additional reporting by Mike Elliott, Richard Barley and Eleanor Wason)
