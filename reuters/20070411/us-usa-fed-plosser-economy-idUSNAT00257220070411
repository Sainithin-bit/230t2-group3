 NEWARK, Delaware  (Reuters) - Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank President Charles Plosser said on Tuesday that the U.S. economy is not as strong as the Fed had expected two months ago and prices remained higher. 

 Personal consumption and employment were strong but business investment was weaker, Plosser said in response to a question after delivering a speech to business and economic students at the University of Delaware.
