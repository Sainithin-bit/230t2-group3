 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Citigroup Inc. ( C.N ) and former wealth management head Todd Thomson have ended talks regarding the terms of his departure and Thomson's parachute will not be golden, a source close to the matter said. 

 Thomson left Citigroup abruptly in late January, amid news reports of growing criticism within the largest U.S. bank over his unwillingness to rein in spending. Citigroup said he left to pursue other interests. The 46-year-old Thomson is receiving payment for the time he worked, but did not receive a severance payment, the source said. Citigroup and Thomson declined to discuss the terms of a settlement. In an interview with Reuters, Thomson said: "The settlement is done. I am pleased with it, so now I can turn my attention to what I do next." Citigroup said on Wednesday it would eliminate 17,000 jobs, or about 5 percent of its work force, in a broad restructuring. The bank is under heavy investor pressure to cut costs and boost revenue. Thomson said he was focusing his efforts on his private equity, real estate and advisory venture, Headwaters Capital  LLC. "There's obviously a lot of opportunities and a lot going on out there," he said. "I'm going to take my time and look around and try to find where I can next add the most value."
