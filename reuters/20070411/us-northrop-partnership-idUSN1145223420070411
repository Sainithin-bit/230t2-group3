 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Northrop Grumman Corp. ( NOC.N ) plans to forge an exclusive partnership with Israel Aerospace Industries Ltd. to propose lighter, more-flexible spy satellites to the U.S. military and intelligence agencies, The Wall Street Journal reported. 

 The project, which was code-named "Trinidad" during development and expected to be announced on Wednesday, reflects Northrop's drive to move beyond being primarily a supplier of subsystems for government space programs into the more influential and potentially more profitable role as a prime contractor, the Journal said. The Los Angeles-based company proposes to buy and modify several Israeli-built, high-resolution spy satellites, each costing less than $200 million, the Journal said, which is a fraction of what a larger, more complex U.S. satellite would cost. A representative for Northrop was not immediately available for comment.
