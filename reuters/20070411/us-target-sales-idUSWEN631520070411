 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Discount retailer Target Corp. ( TGT.N ) said on Wednesday that sales at its stores open at least a year rose 12 percent in March, in line with its expectations, and that April same-store sales should fall 2 percent to 4 percent, due to the earlier timing of Easter. 

 Easter fell on April 8 this year compared with April 16 last year, so sales of Easter-related items came largely during the company's March sales period, which ended on April 7. Target issued its sales a day earlier than usual, ahead of a meeting with analysts on Wednesday afternoon. Most major U.S. retailers plan to report March sales results on Thursday. Target's sales for the five weeks ended April 7 jumped 16.8 percent to $5.59 billion. During March, customers spent more, on average, when they shopped and the number of customer transactions was higher, Target said. Same-store sales of toys, sporting goods, food and children's apparel were strong, while sales of intimate apparel and items such as bedding and furniture were weak. Target still expects same-store sales for March and April combined to be up 4 percent to 6 percent from a year earlier. Last year, when Easter fell on April 16, same-store sales rose 2.2 percent in March and jumped 10.4 percent in April. In March 2007, the strongest markets were the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast regions, Minneapolis-based Target said. Target also said that its inventory was in very good condition at the end of March.
