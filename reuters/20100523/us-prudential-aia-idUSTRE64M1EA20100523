 LONDON  (Reuters) - The Treasury is re-looking at plans to float the Asian unit of AIG ( AIG.N ) in case a bid by Prudential ( PRU.L ) to buy the AIA fails, two British newspapers reported on Sunday. 

 Prudential boss Tidjane Thiam has been struggling to make headway with skeptical investors who question the value of his $35.5 billion acquisition of AIA. The Sunday Times said officials had been working on the plans for two weeks, since the first signs of problems appeared with the Prudential deal -- when the UK Financial Services Authority forced a tweak in the bid and an unprecedented last-minute delay. The newspaper said a number of Asia's biggest financial-services firms had been approached by advisers working for the American government. Chinese banks have also been sounded out on their interest. In a separate report, the Independent on Sunday said AIG had asked Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ) and Deutsche Bank ( DBKGn.DE ) to refresh their analysis. The two were lead underwriters on the planned flotation before it was dropped in favor of the Prudential offer. A source familiar with the situation was quoted as saying the two banks had reassured AIG they could still get a flotation away at an attractive price. Prudential declined to comment on the reports.
