 AMSTERDAM  (Reuters) - The Dutch market regulator AFM will investigate speculation with the euro during the euro zone's debt crisis, the Finance Minister said on Saturday. 

 "I have asked the AFM to hold an independent investigation. We will leave no stone unturned, although I am not sure whether this will be possible," Finance Minister Jan Keers de Jager said on EenVandaag television, adding that the AFM already had agreed to execute the investigation. The Dutch parliament voted late on Thursday to follow Germany's lead and limit short selling of securities by investors, parliamentary records showed, although the government might refuse to implement the ban. Germany, in an attack on the financial speculation on which it blames much of the euro zone's debt crisis, on Tuesday announced a solo ban on some high-risk bets that prices of bonds and stocks will fall, a move that shocked markets and surprised other European governments. Dutch market regulator AFM said on Wednesday it had no immediate plans to follow Germany's move but was monitoring the situation. (Reporting by Harro ten Wolde; Editing by  Jerry Norton )
