 LONDON  (Reuters) - A Russian state-owned oil and gas group is one of the parties that made a bid approach to oil giant BP for its half-share in Russian oil producer TNK-BP, a source close to the matter said on Friday. 
 BP said earlier on Friday that it had received indications of possible interest in buying the stake from a number of parties, which it did not name. (Reporting by  Tom Bergin ; Editing by Hans-Juergen Peters)
