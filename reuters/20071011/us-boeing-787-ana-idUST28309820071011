 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japan's All Nippon Airways Co (ANA) ( 9202.T ), the first Boeing 787 customer, said on Thursday a delay in delivery dates for Boeing Co's ( BA.N ) Dreamliner aircraft would not have a huge impact on its operations. 

 Boeing said on Wednesday that first deliveries of the plane would be delayed by at least six months, to late November or December 2008. <ID:nN10273646> ANA spokesman Shinichi Shinkawa said the airline was studying whether the delay would have any impact on its business. "For now, we don't expect it to have such a huge impact," he said. ANA could not comment on the content of its contract with Boeing, including whether Boeing could be penalized for a delivery delay, Shinkawa said. ANA was hoping to ferry passengers to next summer's Beijing Olympic Games in the first of its planned 50 Boeing 787s. Shares of ANA fell 1.3 percent to 459 yen by 0102 GMT, underperforming a 0.04 percent rise on the benchmark Nikkei average  .N225 .
