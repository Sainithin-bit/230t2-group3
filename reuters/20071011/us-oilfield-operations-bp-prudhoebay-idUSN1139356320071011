 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Oil major BP Plc ( BP.L ) has reduced the amount of oil production it expects to lose because of an October 6 fire at its Prudhoe Bay oil field in Alaska by 10,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 20,000 bpd, the company said in a statement. 

 BP initially estimated the fire at Gathering Center 2 at the giant oil field would cut output by 30,000 bpd for two weeks. The company has not changed its estimate for the repair of the facility and continues to expect output to be restored two weeks from the fire.
