 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Winnebago Industries Inc WGO.N>, the No. 1 maker of motor homes, on Thursday reported a better-than-expected rise in quarterly earnings on significantly higher deliveries of its largest models. 

 But the company cautioned that sales would likely be less robust going forward due to sagging consumer confidence levels and traditionally slower quarters. Net profit rose to $14.8 million, or 49 cents per share, in Winnebago's fiscal fourth quarter ended August 25, from $9.3 million, or 30 cents per share a year earlier. That topped analysts' average expectations by 8 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue totaled $237.7 million, exceeding Wall Street forecasts of $223.3 million. Unit deliveries of the company's Class A motor homes were 48 percent higher than in the year ago quarter. "We anticipate softness in motor home sales, however, as we move into our seasonally slower quarters, particularly in light of very low consumer confidence levels nationwide," Bob Olson, president of the Forest City, Iowa-based company said in a statement. "Retail motor home sales levels continue to lag behind last year," Olson added. (Reporting by Nick Zieminski and  Bill Berkrot )
