 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - PepsiCo Inc's ( PEP.N ) chief executive said on Thursday that she was confident the beverage company can meet its long-term sales and earnings targets next year even though raw material costs are expected to keep rising. 

 "I remain confident in our ability to deliver our long-term algorithm of mid-single-digit volume growth ... and at least 10 percent earnings-per-share growth," Chief Executive Indra Nooyi said on a conference call with analysts. Nooyi also said she expected costs for raw materials such as grains, cooking oil and energy to be higher than expected next year. She said Pepsi was now projecting North American inflation on its raw materials, excluding orange juice, to be more than one percentage point above the low single-digit rate they rose this year.
