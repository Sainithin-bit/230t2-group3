 LAS VEGAS  (Reuters) - Chrysler LLC's U.S. sales in October so far are "roughly flat" compared with a year earlier, the automaker's head of North American sales told Reuters on Wednesday. 

 Speaking on the sidelines of an event for Chrysler dealers in Las Vegas on the same day the automaker clinched a new labor deal with its major union, Steve Landry also said Chrysler is targeting a U.S. retail market share of 11 percent this year. Chrysler's sales have fallen 3 percent in the year to September, in line with a slump in the broad market. Landry said the company had maintained a retail market share of 10.7 percent on a year-to-date basis and expected to see that reach 11 percent in the fourth quarter. "Market share is important, but it's not everything. Dealer profitability has to drive volume and share," Landry said. "We are working towards a point where we can reduce the price on new models and reduce the incentives too. Hopefully, we can retain our market share in the process." Landry also said the automaker, which has had excess inventory, plans to reduce its inventory by 100,000 units in 2007. Chrysler Vice Chairman Jim Press, who was also speaking at the event, said he would like to reduce that number further in 2008. Press also said Chrysler's efforts to weed out an overlap in similar models, which wind up competing with each other, should be evident by next year. "You'll see changes as early as next year," Press said. "We have velocity at this company. The advantage of being under private ownership is that we can do things very quickly," he said. DaimlerChrysler sold a roughly 80 percent stake in Chrysler in May to Cerberus Capital Management in a $7.4 billion deal. Press, who was hired from Toyota Motor Corp last month, also said the automaker would be able to change its entire product pipeline "much before the end of the decade." "Right now, we are still going through the process of developing a long-term strategic vision of what the company's product portfolio should look like in the next 10 to 15 years," Press said. "But we are moving quickly. We already have over 200 engineering change recommendations in process that are impacting vehicles in production ... so things are moving fast." Press also said foreign automakers may soon see a less favorable "tailwind" in the United States as shifts in currency rates and rising overseas costs could slow their sales. "The favorable tailwind international brands have been enjoying could change," Press said. The U.S. dollar's value has fallen relative to most major foreign currencies this year, threatening to weaken U.S. profit for Japanese and German brands.
