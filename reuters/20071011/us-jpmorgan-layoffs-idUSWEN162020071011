 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co ( JPM.N ) notified staff that jobs are being eliminated in the investment banking division, people familiar with the situation said on Thursday, as investors brace for a large write-down at the No. 3 U.S. bank. 

 Job cuts include staff and executives involved with asset-backed securities and collateralized-debt obligations, sources said. Earlier this month, Deutsche Bank analyst Mike Mayo predicted JPMorgan should have about $2 billion in leveraged loan write-downs before fees and hedges. JPMorgan is expected to post lower profit when it releases third-quarter results next week because of the big write-downs, which have roiled rivals such as Bear Stearns Cos. BSC.N and Merrill Lynch & Co Inc MER.N. JPMorgan reported having 179,664 total employees in July. About 25,400 jobs are in the investment banking division. JPMorgan was not immediately available for comment.  (Reporting by  Tim McLaughlin )
