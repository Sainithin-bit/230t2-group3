 SYDNEY  (Reuters) - Australia's Qantas Airways Ltd ( QAN.AX ) said on Thursday a delay in first delivery dates for Boeing Co's ( BA.N ) 787 Dreamliner aircraft would have no impact on its operations. 

 Boeing said on Wednesday that first deliveries of the plane would be delayed by at least six months to late November of December 2008. Qantas said in a statement it saw no reason to change its earnings forecasts.
