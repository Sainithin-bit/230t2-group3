 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve decided a half-percentage point interest rate cut was needed September 18 after initial steps failed to return U.S. financial markets to normal, Fed Governor Randall Kroszner said on Thursday. 

 "At that time, we judged that a 50 basis point lowering of the target federal funds rate was appropriate to offset the effects of tighter financial conditions on the economic outlook and reduce the risks that a further tightening in credit conditions could impact the housing market and lead to significant broader weakness in output and employment," Kroszner said in remarks prepared for delivery to the National Bankers' Association convention in Durham, North Carolina. Before that decision by the Fed's policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee, the U.S. central bank had used a range of policy tools during market turbulence over the summer to counter potential damage to the economy, Kroszner said. Among these, the Fed lowered its discount rate, the rate it charges banks for loans, by a half-percentage point to 5.75 percent on August 17. "The actions appeared helpful in mitigating some of the strains in financial markets, but financial market functioning had not returned to normal by the time of the September FOMC meeting," he said.
