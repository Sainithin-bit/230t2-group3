 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Prosecutors on Wednesday asked an appellate court to reinstate criminal charges against 13 former KPMG KPMG.UL partners in a closely watched case involving questionable tax shelters. 

 The U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit to reverse an order by a federal court judge dismissing the indictment against the former partners of the accounting firm. The filing of the brief marks the government's bid to resurrect what it had once touted as the largest ever criminal tax prosecution and points to its intent to pursue such cases despite a major setback. U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan in Manhattan had dismissed charges against 13 of the 18 defendants in July, saying prosecutors violated their constitutional rights by inappropriately interfering with their defense. "The government did not unconstitutionally coerce KPMG into deciding to condition and limit payment of attorneys fees," prosecutors said in a 120-page brief. Prosecutors accused the defendants in 2005 of helping cheat the federal government out of $2.5 billion by setting up questionable tax shelters for wealthy clients. But the case against most defendants began to unravel last year when Kaplan ruled that the government violated their constitutional rights by pressuring KPMG to withhold legal fees. KPMG -- in conjunction with a $456 million settlement agreement that allowed it to avoid its own indictment -- had withheld payment of legal fees of its former partners. Prosecutors said that any interference in the payment of those fees ended by March 30, 2006, "when the government, on the record in open court, stated unequivocally that it had no objection to KPMG paying the defendants' attorneys fees." "KPMG was free to exercise its business judgment as to whether to advance fees to the defendants," the government said. The government said that the defendants had been charged for about seven months by then and to the extent their constitutional rights were violated, "the proper remedy was not dismissal, but rather additional time to prepare for trial." "Albeit unintentionally, the district court has already provided precisely that relief," it said. Since July, one of the remaining five defendants has pleaded guilty in the case, while jury selection began earlier this week in the case against the other four.
