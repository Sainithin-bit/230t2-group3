 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Bear Stearns & Cos. BSC.N set a target of 1,700 at year-end 2008 for the benchmark Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX , the company said on Thursday. 

 The new target implies total upside of 11 percent, based on an 8.7 percent annualized return and a 1.7 percent dividend yield for stocks that make up the S&P 500, Bear Stearns said. The U.S. economy is entering a period of below-trend, non-recessionary growth, said chief investment strategist Jonathan Golub. "However, global growth continues to be strong. Inflation and interest rates remain at relatively low levels. Corporate balance sheets are strong, and stock market valuations appear reasonable," Golub said. The S&P 500 was at 1570.91, up 0.54 percent on Thursday.
