 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Student lender Sallie Mae SLM.N posted a third-quarter loss on Thursday as chairman Albert Lord told investors it is still possible for the consortium that agreed to buy out the student lender for $60 a share in cash to execute the contract as signed. 

 If the proposed $25 billion buyout of Sallie Mae, which has ended up in court, falls through, Lord said he still believes the student lender's future should be as a private company. Sallie Mae "remains a superb candidate to be a private company," Lord told investors on a conference call on Thursday. "Personally, I strongly believe that the company's future is as a private company," Lord added. Asked if there was interest from other parties, Lord replied: "We get calls." Lord said he had returned to day-to-day operations at Sallie Mae as executive chairman to help "pick up the pace" at the company. Sallie Mae posted a quarterly loss of $344 million, or $0.85 a share, on Thursday compared with a profit of $263 million, or 60 cents a share, a year earlier, reflecting losses from derivative and hedging activities. But investors were just as interested in any updates from Lord on the buyout that appears to be unraveling. Sallie Mae has filed a lawsuit in the Delaware Chancery Court seeking a breakup fee of $900 million from the consortium of private equity firms J.C. Flowers & Co and Friedman Fleischer and Lowe and major banks JP Morgan Chase & Co ( JPM.N ) and Bank of America Corp ( BAC.N ). The consortium agreed in April to pay $60 a share for Sallie Mae, but last week proposed to cut its price to $50 a share plus extra payments depending on how the company performed, citing a recent credit market squeeze and legislation that slashes subsidies to student lenders. Sallie Mae has said the buyers should stick to the original agreement and the revised proposal has since expired. Sallie Mae shares closed up 13 cents at $48.76 on Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange. POKER Sallie Mae's lawsuit is being viewed by many as a hardball attempt by Lord to force the buyer group to stick to the $60-a- share agreement or come up with a new offer close to it. The consortium argues Sallie Mae has suffered a "material adverse change" to its business due to the legislation and the credit market squeeze, but Sallie Mae disagrees. The student lender's lawsuit seeks a declaration that the buyer group has reneged on the merger agreement; that no material adverse change has occurred; and that Sallie Mae may terminate the takeover and collect the $900 million. The original buyout has a $900 million breakup fee. But if the consortium could prove Sallie Mae suffered a material adverse change, they would not have to pay it. The buyer group is led by J.C. Flowers and its managing director Christopher Flowers, a high-profile deal maker. "Chris Flowers wants to own Sallie Mae -- I firmly believe that," said Lord on Thursday. "Unfortunately, he wants the wholesale price -- he doesn't want to pay the retail price that he signed up for. But it is still possible for him to execute this contract as he signed it." To laughter, Lord told the conference call in New York: "Chris, I know you are here somewhere. I know you are here. You could still do it." Lord said the Flowers-led consortium remained the most logical owners for Sallie Mae, but they were not the only possible owners. "I'm not playing poker," he added. "The board is not playing poker. We are trying to do what we have always done and that is create value by running the company well." J.C. Flowers had no immediate response to Lord's comments. EARNINGS In its third-quarter earnings statement, Sallie Mae, known legally as SLM Corp, said that, on a pre-tax basis, losses on derivative and hedging activities were $487 million in the period. Ignoring certain nonrecurring costs, such as those related to recent legislative changes and $18 million tied to its merger agreement, Sallie Mae said third quarter core income was $305 million, or 70 cents per share. Analysts had, on average, expected quarterly earnings of 73 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Lord told investors: "The deal distractions are significant. They have cost us earnings momentum." Kathleen Shanley, analyst at Gimme Credit, a corporate bonds research firm, said her firm did not hear much from Lord that allayed its concerns about credit quality going forward. "No deal would be the best deal for bondholders, but it is premature to conclude that will be the final outcome of the dispute," said Shanley in a report.
