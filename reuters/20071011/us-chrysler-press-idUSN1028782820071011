 LAS VEGAS  (Reuters) - A health-care trust that is part of a tentative agreement between the United Auto Workers and Chrysler LLC will help to level the playing field between the automaker and foreign competitors, an executive said on Wednesday. 

 "Anything we can do to remove costs that aren't finding their way to the customer, we need to do, and health-care costs is one of them," Chrysler vice chairman Jim Press said. Chrysler said earlier on Wednesday that it had agreed to a health-care trust known as a Voluntary Employees Beneficiary Association, or VEBA, but did not disclose details. The VEBA deal "helps level the playing field with other automakers," said Press, a Toyota veteran hired away by Chrysler in August, who was speaking at an event for Chrysler dealers in Las Vegas.
