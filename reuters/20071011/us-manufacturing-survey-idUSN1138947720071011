 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Manufacturing in areas of the U.S. economy not related to the housing sector should expand over the next three to six months, a survey released on Thursday showed. 

 In its quarterly business outlook survey, the Manufacturers Alliance/MAPI composite index of future business activity was 65 in September, unchanged from June. Fifty-six senior financial executives from the trade group's members participated in the September 2007 survey. When the index is over 50, this signals higher manufacturing output over the next three to six months, the trade group said. Also, when asked how the financial turmoil that erupted in August had affected their company's capital projects, 96 percent of respondents said that there had been no significant impact on investment. "(A)lthough industries whose businesses are linked to the housing sector are being adversely affected by the reduction in activity there, it remains to be seen if the financial turmoil that surfaced this summer will worsen or whether the Federal Reserve Bank is able to calm financial markets and prevent a credit crunch," the Manufacturers Alliance/MAPI said in a release accompanying the survey.
