 DURHAM, North Carolina  (Reuters) - Inflation outside of food and energy costs has moderated but some possible price pressures remain, Federal Reserve Governor Randall Kroszner said on Thursday. 

 "Some of the core inflation numbers that I tend to focus on have moved down gradually over the last six months to a year, but there's still some potential inflationary pressures going forward," he said in response to questions after a speech. "We still have very strong world demand, very strong commodity and raw materials prices and so ... we have to get the balance right of maintaining maximum employment growth but ensuring that inflation will stay low and stable," he added.
