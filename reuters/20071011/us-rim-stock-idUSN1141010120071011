 TORONTO  (Reuters) - Shares of BlackBerry maker Research In Motion RIM.TO plunged on Thursday as a Nasdaq selloff in other momentum tech names such as Apple Inc ( AAPL.O ) and China's Baidu.com Inc ( BIDU.O ) appeared to take a toll on the stock. 

 RIM fell $5.88, or 5 percent, to close at $111.00 on the Nasdaq, bouncing back from a low of $105.02 touched earlier in the day. On the Toronto Stock Exchange, it fell C$4.59, or 4 percent, to finish at C$109.99. The drop is small compared to the stock's sharp ascent in the last 12 months. Since October 2006, the shares have more than tripled in value, as demand soars for RIM's wildly popular lineup of smartphones. Canaccord Adams analyst Peter Misek said a broader market slump on the Nasdaq likely led to a pronounced selloff in the stock after initially small moves downward. RIM's plunge came in tandem with declines by other big momentum names. Baidu, China's top Web search company, fell 10.8 percent and Apple gave up 3.4 percent. The Nasdaq as a whole fell 1.6 percent, or 44.56 points, to 2,767.05 on profit-taking and downbeat broker commentary about Baidu's upcoming quarterly results.
