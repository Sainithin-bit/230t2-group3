 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - PepsiCo Inc ( PEP.N ) reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit on Thursday as higher sales of its snacks and beverages and a weak dollar offset the impact of increased raw material costs. 

 The world's second-largest soft drink maker, whose shares rose slightly, said net income for the third quarter ended on September 8 rose 17 percent to $1.74 billion, or $1.06 per share, from $1.49 billion, or 89 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding a tax benefit, PepsiCo earned 99 cents per share, beating the analysts' average forecast of 96 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. Quarterly revenue rose 11 percent to $10.17 billion. PepsiCo, which owns Quaker Oats cereals, Frito Lay snacks and SoBe beverages, has been diversifying to offset declining soft-drink sales in the United States, where consumers are turning to bottled water, tea and other alternatives that they consider healthier. In the North American drinks segment, revenue was up 3 percent, helped by price increases and acquisitions, although case volume fell 1 percent. Sales of carbonated beverages like Pepsi Cola fell 3 percent, while noncarbonated products such as Lipton tea and Aquafina water rose 2 percent. Sales of Gatorade sports drinks and juice brands such as Tropicana fell at a mid-single-digit percentage rate. The juice business suffered because of price increases taken to offset higher costs for raw materials such as oranges. At the Frito Lay business in North America, net revenue grew 6 percent, and volume rose 2 percent. In the international unit, revenue climbed 22 percent, helped by price increases, a 7 percent rise in snack volume and an 8 percent increase in beverage volume. The weak dollar contributed 6 percentage points of growth as sales in other currencies increased when they were converted to dollars for inclusion on the company's income statement. Acquisitions and divestitures added 7 percentage points of growth. PepsiCo reiterated its previous forecast for full-year core earnings of at least $3.35 per share. Analysts on average were looking for $3.38, excluding items, according to Reuters Estimates. Pepsi said it expected to record restructuring charges of 3 cents per share in the fourth quarter. The Purchase, New York-based company said a new law in Mexico could lift its tax rate above its earlier estimate of 27.3 percent, but it would probably not exceed 27.7 percent. Pepsi shares, which have gained 12 percent since August, trade at 21.8 times earnings estimates for the current year, virtually in line with beverage leader Coca-Cola Co ( KO.N ), whose price-to-earnings multiple is 22. Even though the quarterly results were "nicely ahead" of analysts' estimates, J.P. Morgan analyst John Faucher forecast a muted market response, given the shares' recent appreciation, weaker-than-expected North American beverage volume and the fact that Pepsi did not raise its full-year earnings outlook. The stock was up 10 cents at $73.70 in early New York Stock Exchange trade. (Reporting by Martinne Geller)
