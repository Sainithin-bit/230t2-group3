 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Hospital operator Community Health Systems Inc. ( CYH.N ) over the weekend was near a deal to purchase one of the nation's largest hospital companies, Triad Hospitals Inc. ( TRI.N ), people familiar with the matter said in The Wall Street Journal, breaking up an existing $4.5 billion buyout plan by a group of private-equity funds. 


 Exact details of the offer weren't clear, but one person familiar with the plan described it in the Journal as being "several hundred million dollars" greater than the offer tabled in February by a duo of CCMP Capital Advisors LLC and Goldman Sachs Capital Partners, the private-equity arm of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. ( GS.N ). Community's price so far appears too much for the private-equity consortium to bear, the Journal said.
