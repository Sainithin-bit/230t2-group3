 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. financial markets are likely to experience some fall-out from the subprime mortgage lending woes but they are likely to be limited, the chief investment officer at the biggest U.S. pension told Reuters on Monday. 


 The subprime sector "is an important weakness in the economy and it is likely that there will be a measured impact in other sectors. And there is likely to be some contagion," said Russell Read of Calpers, which invests about $232 billion for California state workers. Default rates in the subprime segment of the U.S. mortgage market have jumped in recent months as the housing industry has slowed and prices fallen. Subprime mortgages are made to borrowers with poor credit histories. Some of the other sectors that could be impacted were the high-yield bond markets where defaults are likely to creep up, Read said in an interview on the sidelines of a Council of Institutional Investors meeting. He added, "we are concerned but not worried." "This doesn't have the same overall negative consequences for the economy or for the state of California the way the Orange County collapse did," Read said, referring to the largest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history. The wealthy California county discovered problems in 1994 that led to bankruptcy after it lost $1.6 billion in a losing bet on interest rate-sensitive securities. Calpers has little direct exposure to the subprime sector, Read said. (For more about the subprime mortgage crisis, see <ID:nN07265694>)
