 AMSTERDAM  (Reuters) - Dutch bank ABN AMRO AAH.AS and 
British bank Barclays ( BARC.L ) confirmed on Monday they were in 
exclusive "exploratory discussions" to merge with each other. 


  "ABN AMRO confirms that it is in exclusive preliminary 
discussions with Barclays plc concerning a potential 
combination of the two organizations," ABN AMRO said in a 
statement.  In a separate statement, Barclays also acknowledged it was 
in early and exclusive discussions with ABN AMRO.  "These discussions are the result of careful consideration 
to create a highly complementary partnership. The talks are at 
an early and exploratory stage and there can be no certainty 
that they will lead to a transaction," the Dutch bank added.  Shares in Dutch bank ABN AMRO hit a record high on Monday 
as Barclays and other banks considered a takeover approach that 
could result in Europe's biggest financial services deal.
