 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rallied on Monday after Britain's Barclays Plc and Dutch bank ABN AMRO confirmed they were in talks to merge, helping the financial sector recover from its recent hammering in the subprime mortgage market turmoil. 


 A slew of merger-and-acquisition deals in other industries, including energy, added to optimism about the prospects for growth in both corporate profits and the U.S. economy and reassured investors about liquidity levels. "M&A remains the story. Everywhere you look there's a deal," said Eric Kuby, chief investment officer at North Star Investment Management Corp. in Chicago. "The buyers of these businesses are forecasting an economy that may be slowing but not falling off a cliff. Therefore, valuations may be attractive." The Dow Jones industrial average ended up 115.76 points, or 0.96 percent, at 12,226.17. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index closed up 15.11 points, or 1.09 percent, at 1,402.06. The Nasdaq Composite Index finished up 21.75 points, or 0.92 percent, at 2,394.41. Despite the broad rally, trading was moderately low on the NYSE, with about 1.46 billion shares changing hands, below last year's estimated daily average of 1.84 billion. On Nasdaq, about 1.69 billion shares traded, below last year's daily average of 2.02 billion. U.S.-listed shares of ABN AMRO shot up 14.1 percent, or $5.12, to $41.36 per share and touched a lifetime high of $41.56. Meanwhile, other U.S. banks gained on the consolidation buzz running through the sector. Shares of JPMorgan Chase & Co., the No. 3 U.S. bank, rose 1.2 percent, or 55 cents, to $47.58. Bank of America Corp. shares also ranked among the session's biggest advancers, up 1.5 percent, or 75 cents, at $50.37. Investors snapped up shares of industrial bellwethers such as Caterpillar Inc., betting that the Federal Reserve will not want to risk plunging the economy into a sharp slowdown by raising interest rates amid a faltering housing market. Caterpillar shares rose 1.6 percent, or $1.01, to $64.17. The Fed's policy-making Federal Open Market Committee starts a two-day meeting on Tuesday. Financial markets expect the U.S. central bank to leave the benchmark federal funds rate unchanged at 5.25 percent. Investors will focus on the wording of the Fed's announcement on monetary policy and an accompanying statement on the economic outlook, both expected on Wednesday. Even though investors appeared to worry less about the possibility of subprime mortgage market worries cascading into other sectors of the economy, shares of companies in that sector -- which extends home loans to borrowers with poor credit histories -- remained lower. Accredited Home Lenders Holding Co. fell 17.9 percent, or $1.95, to $8.95 on the Nasdaq after the company said it still had not landed a financing deal to boost its liquidity. Back on the mergers-and-acquisition front, ServiceMaster Co.'s shares jumped 12.5 percent, or $1.68, to $15.15 after an investment group led by private equity investment firm Clayton, Dubilier & Rice Inc. agreed to buy the company -- whose businesses include pest control and lawn care -- for $4.7 billion. Shares of oil and drilling services company Todco rose 19.7 percent, or $6.46, to $39.24 after Hercules Offshore Inc. said it had agreed to buy the company for $2.3 billion. The Blackstone Group, along with The Carlyle Group and Riverstone Holdings, are mulling a rival offer for TXU Corp., a source familiar with the situation said on Sunday. That could scupper a record-breaking $32 billion bid for the Texas power company from competing buyout firms. TXU shares ended up 2.9 percent, or $1.81, at $64.56 on the NYSE. Advancing stocks outnumbered decliners by a ratio of about 3 to 1 on the NYSE and by 2 to 1 on Nasdaq. (Additional reporting by  Caroline Valetkevitch )
