 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Deepening problems in the subprime mortgage sector, which caters to borrowers with weak credit histories, chipped away at U.S. homebuilder confidence in March, the National Association of Home Builders said on Monday. 


 The NAHB/Wells Fargo Housing Market index fell three points in March to 36 from a downwardly revised 39 a month earlier, the group said. While the March reading was up from a 15-year low of 30 in September 2006 as five years of double-digit home price gains and rising interest rates squeezed affordability, it came in well below a reading of 54 in the same month a year ago. Readings below 50 mean fewer builders view market conditions as favorable rather than poor. "Builders are uncertain about the consequences of tightening mortgage lending standards for their home sales down the line, and some are already seeing effects of the subprime shakeout on current sales activity," said NAHB Chief Economist David Seiders. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index would drop to 38 from an originally reported 40 in February. Several dozen companies have closed shop in the past year in the subprime sector, battered by borrower defaults and demand from the companies' own lenders to take back soured loans at a loss. "The critical issue is whether the deterioration in the subprime mortgage market infects other sectors, not just the housing market," said Gregory Miller, chief economist at SunTrust Banks Inc. in Atlanta, Georgia. "Indeed from the Federal Reserve's perspective there's risk that subprime could infect other major sectors of the entire economy," he said. FED SCRUTINY The Fed's policymaking group starts a two-day meeting on Tuesday to mull the course of benchmark short-term interest rates. An announcement on monetary policy accompanied by a statement on the economic outlook are expected on Wednesday. "I think that the Fed will acknowledge it," Miller said of the subprime problems and possible broader ripple effects. "I also think that the Fed will not design monetary policy around it, unless it becomes clear to the Fed that this infection part is taking place." The Chicago Fed on Monday said its Midwest manufacturing index fell in January mostly due to auto and machinery sector weakness. Click on <ID:nCHB000263> for more details.

The gauges of current single-family home sales and expected sales in the next six months each dropped three points, to readings of 37 and 50, respectively. The index of prospective buyer traffic slipped 1 point to 28 in March. Builder sentiment had been trending higher since its September trough. The upturn was spurred by builders offering incentives like pools and vacations, and slicing prices that sweetened the deal for buyers and pushed unsold homes off builders' inventories. Whittling away the supply of unsold homes that had swelled before builders started tossing incentives at buyers is critical for a sustained housing rebound, most economists agree. NAHB remains optimistic about home sales this year despite the uncertainty the subprime meltdown may create for the housing sector and the broader U.S. economy. Better affordability and solid growth in employment and household income are seen as factors that could result in a "modest improvement in home sales during the balance of 2007, although the problems in the mortgage market increase the degree of uncertainty surrounding our baseline (i.e., most probable) forecast," it said. Housing was mixed regionally in March with the NAHB indexes up slightly in the Midwest and West and down in the Northeast and South. The South, which includes the condo-glutted Florida market, had the biggest swing, falling 4 points to 40.
