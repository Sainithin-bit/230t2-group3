 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - CBOT Holdings Inc., parent of the number 2 U.S. futures exchange, said on Monday its board had authorized talks with IntercontinentalExchange Inc., the energy mart that on Thursday made an unsolicited $9.9 billion takeover offer. 


 CBOT said its planned merger with the CME Holdings remains in effect and that a shareholder vote on that deal is still expected on April 4. The exchange said it has not withdrawn or modified its recommendation that CBOT shareholders vote in favor of a merger with CME, the largest U.S. futures exchange. That deal, announced in October, values CBOT at about $8.97 billion and is undergoing a review by the U.S. Department of Justice. The CBOT said it would not comment further on ICE's proposal until its board and its special transaction committee had completed a review. Earlier on Monday, ICE suggested that a definitive deal with the Board of Trade could be completed quickly. "We are confident that ... we can complete our review and be in a position to execute a definitive transaction agreement within one week," ICE chief executive Jeffrey Sprecher said in a release. Sprecher will hold a meeting in Chicago on Wednesday to discuss the ICE proposal, which would join the CBOT to the upstart energy derivatives exchange. In late trading at the New York Stock Exchange, ICE shares were at $128.55, up $2.17, or 1.7 percent. CBOT was up $6.21, or 3.3 percent, at $196.19, and CME shares were up $1.32, or 0.25 percent, at $528.32.
