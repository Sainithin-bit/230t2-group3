 AMSTERDAM  (Reuters) - Dutch chemical distributor Univar NV UNIV.AS said on Monday that U.S. chemicals distributor Chemcentral Corp., which it is buying, has received a $700 million competing bid from Brenntag Holding GmBH. 


 On March 12, Univar said it was buying Chemcentral for $600 million in cash, including assumed debt, to expand its U.S. operations. "If the Chemcentral board of directors determines that a competing proposal is superior to Univar's, Chemcentral must give Univar advance notice of 3 business days, during which period Univar may decide, but is not required, to negotiate with Chemcentral to make adjustments in the terms and conditions of their merger agreement," Univar said in a statement. It said German chemical distributor Brenntag's non-binding offer, which is subject to due diligence and other conditions, included a reduced termination fee payable to Univar. Chemcentral may end the merger agreement with Univar in favor of a competing offer if it pays Univar a termination fee of $22 million, the Dutch company said. Privately held Chemcentral, based near Chicago, had $1.4 billion in 2006 revenues and distributes specialty and commodity chemicals.
