 VIENNA  (Reuters) - Private equity firm CVC Capital Partners said on Monday it was in talks with specialty steel maker Boehler-Uddeholm about a friendly takeover offer, in a move bankers said could mark the start of private equity investment in the sector. 


 Ending speculation that has sent Boehler share prices rocketing by 40 percent over the past week, the European buyout firm said it had met the company's board and its biggest shareholder, but only would bid if management agreed. Shares in Boehler, which makes high-quality steel for tools, razor blades and jet engines, rose by 30 percent on Friday alone due to a market order for more than 900,000 shares. But CVC said it had not bought any Boehler shares so far, adding it was surprised at the recent share price movement, which it called "completely excessive." "If CVC's consideration results in it making an offer, the price would be based on the company's results and the share price performance over the past months, not on short-term share price movements," CVC said. At Friday's close, Boehler was worth 4.2 billion euros ($5.6 billion). The stock was suspended on Monday morning and after resuming trade, gave back some of its gains -- easing by as much as 15.8 percent and closing down 13.6 percent at 70.30 euros. PRIVATE EQUITY EMERGES Steel companies have been merging rapidly in a bid to boost their influence over customers and suppliers as demand for steel soars, but financial investors have mostly shied away. Yet with steel stocks among the best performers after a tough few years, private equity might look again, bankers say. "Since the second half of 2006 we have started to discuss the steel industry with financial sponsors," said one London-based banker familiar with the sector. "There is a realization that the bad years for steel are over, and profitability has gone up considerably," the banker said on condition of anonymity. "You can buy now, enjoy a re-rating of the sector and sell in about three years' time." Boehler, a former state-owned company, made its debut on the stock market in 1995 and was fully privatized in 2003. Its only large shareholder is the BU Industrieholding, led by Austrian Rudolf Fries, which owns 21 percent. Speaking about the possible takeover in an interview with state broadcaster ORF, Boehler Chief Executive Claus Raidl said: "I think that the financial investor's plan is to buy, first of all, the stake held by the Fries group." Also in an interview, Fries said he would sell the stake if the company's headquarters would remain in Austria and the company would be retained in its current form, according to ORF. "We told CVC that we would be basically ready to sell under the right circumstances," Fries told the broadcaster. CVC had already said that if it were to become a new core shareholder, Boehler would remain listed with headquarters in Austria. Boehler shares are valued at 16 times next year's estimated earnings per share, while the average for large European steelmakers is 11.
