 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Private-equity firm Clayton, Dubilier & Rice is expected to announce on Monday the acquisition of home-services operator ServiceMaster Co. ( SVM.N ) for about $4.8 billion, according to people familiar with the matter, The Wall Street Journal reported. 


 Clayton Dubilier is expected to pay ServiceMaster's shareholders about $15.63 per share, a 16 percent premium to where the Memphis, Tenn., company's shares closed Friday, the Journal said. As part of the deal, Clayton Dubilier will also assume about $700 million of ServiceMaster's existing debt, while keeping the company's current management in place, the Journal said.
