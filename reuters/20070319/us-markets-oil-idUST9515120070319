 LONDON  (Reuters) - Oil steadied around $57 a barrel on Monday, drawing support from investors' expectations for strong gasoline demand this summer in top consumer the United States. 


 Prices have been pressured by troubles in the U.S. housing sector that sparked concern in global stock markets about U.S. economic growth. U.S. crude fell as low as $56.17 on Friday, the lowest since the end of January. "Barring some very bearish economic data from the U.S., oil prices should recover in the coming weeks on falling U.S. gasoline stocks amid the driving season," said Gerard Burg, analyst at National Australia Bank. U.S. crude for April was down 21 cents at $56.90 at 1351 GMT. London Brent for May was up 26 cents to $60.56. Gasoline futures outpaced crude, rising 0.9 percent. Demand for the fuel in the United States rises in the summer months as motorists take to the road for holidays. China's move at the weekend to raise interest rates led to price falls on Monday in some commodities, such as copper. China is the world's second-largest oil consumer. "This is a pretty clear signal that Chinese authorities think that growth is a bit too fast," said Tony Dolphin, director of economics and strategy at Henderson Global Investors. "It gives people another reason to sell today, if they were thinking of selling." Weakness in U.S. crude for April before the contract expires on Tuesday was also weighing on the market, traders said. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, which agreed last week to keep supply curbs of 1.7 million barrels per day in place, are keeping a close watch on the global economy. Should prices fall sharply, the group that pumps more than a third of the world's oil would hold a special meeting. The next scheduled OPEC gathering is in September. "If oil prices in international markets go down, certainly OPEC will make new decisions by holding an emergency meeting," Iranian Oil Minister Kazem Vaziri-Hamaneh said on Saturday. He did not give a specific price level. (Additional reporting by  Fayen Wong  in Sydney)
