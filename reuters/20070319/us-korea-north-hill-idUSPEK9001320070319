 BEIJING  (Reuters) - North Korea was on track to fulfill its side of a breakthrough disarmament accord by shutting down its main atomic facility next month, the U.S. envoy to talks on the North's nuclear program said on Sunday. 


 North Korea agreed at six-party talks in February that group the two Koreas, the United States, host China, Japan and Russia to shutter its Yongbyon reactor and readmit inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency within 60 days. "I think we are on schedule for the shutdown of the facilities and monitoring by the IAEA," U.S. chief negotiator Christopher Hill told reporters.
