 HELSINKI  (Reuters) - The world's top cellphone maker Nokia 
( NOK1V.HE ) said on Monday it had filed complaints against 
Qualcomm ( QCOM.O ) patents in Germany and the Netherlands. 


  Nokia said it wanted authorities to rule that Qualcomm's 
European patents are exhausted in respect of products placed on 
the European Union market with a Qualcomm license, in this 
instance chipsets supplied by Texas Instruments TXN.N.  Texas Instruments and Qualcomm are publicly known to have 
entered into a Patent Portfolio License in 2000.  "If Nokia's claim succeeds, Qualcomm would be prevented in 
Europe from enforcing its respective patents in relation to 
Nokia handsets incorporating such chipsets," Nokia said.
