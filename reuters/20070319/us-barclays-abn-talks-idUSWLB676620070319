 LONDON  (Reuters) - UK bank Barclays ( BARC.L ) is set to announce that it is in takeover talks with Dutch rival ABN AMRO AAH.AS, a source familiar with the matter said on Monday. 


 The UK's third largest bank, which said earlier on Monday after media reports on the talks that it would clarify its position before stock markets open on Tuesday, plans to make the statement as early as later on Monday, the source said. Barclays declined to comment on the matter.
