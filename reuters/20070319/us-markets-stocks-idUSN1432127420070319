 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rallied on Monday after Britain's Barclays Plc ( BARC.L ) ( BCS.N ) and Dutch bank ABN AMRO AAH.ASABN.N confirmed they were in talks to merge, boosting financial shares in the wake of the subprime mortgage market turmoil. 


 A slew of M&A deals in other industries, including energy, added to optimism about the prospects for growth in both corporate profits and the U.S. economy. "M&A remains the story. Everywhere you look there's a deal," said Eric Kuby, chief investment officer at North Star Investment Management Corp. in Chicago. "The buyers of these businesses are forecasting an economy that may be slowing but not falling off a cliff. Therefore, valuations may be attractive." The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  ended up 115.76 points, or 0.96 percent, at 12,226.17. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  closed up 15.11 points, or 1.09 percent, at 1,402.06. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  finished up 21.75 points, or 0.92 percent, at 2,394.41. U.S.-listed shares of ABN AMRO ABN.N, shot up 14.1 percent to $41.36 and touched a lifetime high of $41.56. Meanwhile, other U.S. banks gained on the consolidation buzz running through the sector. Shares of JPMorgan Chase & Co. ( JPM.N ), the No. 3 U.S. bank, rose 1.2 percent to $47.58 Bank of America Corp. ( BAC.N ) shares also ranked among the session's biggest advancers, up 1.5 percent at $50.37. Investors snapped up shares of industrial bellwethers such as Caterpillar Inc. ( CAT.N ), betting that the Federal Reserve would not want to risk plunging the economy into a sharp slowdown by raising interest rates amid a faltering housing market. Caterpillar shares rose 1.6 percent to $64.17. The Fed's policy-making body starts a two-day meeting on Tuesday. Financial markets expect the U.S. central bank to leave the benchmark federal funds rate unchanged at 5.25 percent. Investors will focus on the wording of the Fed's announcement on monetary policy and an accompanying statement on the economic outlook, both expected on Wednesday. Even though investors appeared to worry less about the possibility of subprime mortgage market worries cascading into other sectors of the economy, shares of companies in that sector -- which extends home loans to borrowers with poor credit histories -- remained lower. Accredited Home Lenders Holding Co. LEND.O fell 17.9 percent to $8.95 on the Nasdaq after the company said it still had not landed a financing deal to boost its liquidity. Back on the mergers-and-acquisition front, ServiceMaster Co.'s ( SVM.N ) shares jumped 12.5 percent to $15.15 after an investment group led by private equity investment firm Clayton, Dubilier & Rice Inc. agreed to buy the company -- whose businesses include pest control and lawn care -- for $4.7 billion.

( HERO.O ) said it had agreed to buy the company for $2.3 billion. The Blackstone Group, along with The Carlyle Group and Riverstone Holdings, are mulling a rival offer for TXU Corp. TXU.N, a source familiar with the situation said on Sunday. That could scupper a record-breaking $32 billion bid for the Texas power company from competing buyout firms. TXU shares were up 2.9 percent at $64.56 on the NYSE. Trading was moderate on the NYSE, with about 1.46 billion shares changing hands, below last year's estimated daily average of 1.84 billion, while on Nasdaq, about 1.69 billion shares traded, below last year's daily average of 2.02 billion. Advancing stocks outnumbered declining ones by a ratio of about 3 to 1 on the NYSE and by 2 to 1 on Nasdaq. (Additional reporting by  Caroline Valetkevitch )
