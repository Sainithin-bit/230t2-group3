 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - ServiceMaster Co. ( SVM.N ), which owns TruGreen LawnCare and Terminix pest control, said on Monday that it had accepted a $4.7 billion takeover bid from a  group led by private equity firm Clayton, Dubilier & Rice Inc. 


 The takeover firm, known as CD&R, offered to pay $15.625 per share and will assume about $800 million in debt, according to ServiceMaster. ServiceMaster shares rose $1.64, or 12.2 percent, to $15.11 at mid-afternoon on the New York Stock Exchange. ServiceMaster's businesses include American Home Shield warranties and the Merry Maids cleaning service, as well as drain cleaning and furniture repair operations. Facing a falling stock price, higher costs and a loss of customers, ServiceMaster put itself up for sale last November, hiring investment bank Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ) to run the process. Several private equity firms pursued it, according to sources involved in the process, attracted to ServiceMaster's steady cash flow and its turnaround prospects. CD&R partner Richard Schnall said on Monday he had no immediate plans to sell any of ServiceMaster's companies. "We think there are some opportunities for synergies among the businesses," said Schnall. "Obviously, particularly in the smaller businesses, there are some strategic opportunities which we will explore over time, but our current intent is to keep the businesses together." New York-based CD&R has invested in companies such as rental car company Hertz, copier Kinko's, and equipment supplier Rexel. Once the deal closes, CD&R's operating partner, George Tamke, will become chairman of the ServiceMaster board. Patrick Spainhour will remain chief executive. CD&R will pay $1.5 billion cash for ServiceMaster, with debt financing from Banc of America, Citigroup and JPMorgan. The banks have also committed to an equity portion of the deal. CD&R will pay around 11 to 12 times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization -- a measure of cash flow closely watched by private equity firms, which buy companies by borrowing most of the money, and sell them later. Buyout firms seek strong cash flows to help pay down debt and grow profit margins. The multiple paid to ServiceMaster is higher than the average price of eight to nine times EBITDA paid for leveraged buyout deals last year, according to private equity analysts. "We view the valuation as fair, given the robust nature of the auction," Barrington Research analyst Alexander Paris said in a research note, advising clients to accept the offer. "(We) don't expect a third party to top the agreed-upon bid." Barrington downgraded ServiceMaster shares to "market perform" from "outperform." ServiceMaster, which was founded in 1929, competes with Scotts Miracle-Gro Co.'s ( SMG.N ) lawn care products, and Rollins Inc.'s ( ROL.N ) Orkin pest-control business, among others. Shareholders will vote on the deal at a special meeting during the second quarter. Including Monday's gains, ServiceMaster shares are up 27 percent since November. Last month, it said retention rates had started to improve, and it started to use direct mail and other marketing efforts to attract new customers, putting less emphasis on telemarketing. ServiceMaster still expects to move its headquarters to Memphis, Tennessee, from Illinois by early July, spokesman Steve Bono said. (Additional reporting by Ankur Relia in Bangalore)
