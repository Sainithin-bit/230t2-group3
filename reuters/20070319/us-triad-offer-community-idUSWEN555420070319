 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Triad Hospitals Inc. ( TRI.N ) has agreed to be bought by Community Health Systems Inc. ( CYH.N ) for $5.1 billion in a deal that will create the biggest publicly traded U.S. hospital chain, the companies said on Monday. 


 Triad shareholders will receive $54 per share, a 9.4 percent premium over the stock's closing price on Friday. Including $1.7 billion of assumed debt, the deal is worth $6.8 billion. The deal tops a $4.7 billion agreement announced six weeks ago for Triad to be purchased by CCMP Capital Advisors LLC and Goldman Sachs Capital Partners, the private equity arm of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. ( GS.N ). Deal-making in the hospital sector has been led by private equity groups, which have taken advantage of relatively low valuations and a motivation by management to escape quarterly scrutiny by Wall Street amid a weak operating environment. The No. 1 U.S. hospital chain, HCA Inc., went private in a $22 billion management-led buyout last year. Several analysts, though, were surprised by the Triad- Community marriage, saying they wanted to see proof of the cost savings and efficiencies that would justify the premium being paid by Community. "It's obviously a premium to not just the previous bid but, by my calculations, to the HCA transaction, for what is clearly lower-quality assets," Balaji Gandhi, an analyst at Oppenheimer said. Community Health executives on a conference call said the deal would reduce earnings in 2008, but would be likely add value in 2009. It expects $40 million to $50 million in operating cost savings in its first full calendar year. The deal will be entirely financed through debt. Triad shares rose about 5 percent on news of the deal, while Community shares slumped about 5 percent, both on the New York Stock Exchange. Combined, the companies would rank No. 1 among publicly traded hospital chains, both in revenue and number of hospitals. Nashville, Tennessee-based Community had revenue of $4.37 billion in 2006, while Plano, Texas-based Triad had revenue of $5.54 billion. The biggest publicly traded hospital chain now is Dallas- based Tenet Healthcare Corp. ( THC.N ), which had revenue of $8.7 billion last year. NEW STRATEGY? Bear Stearns analyst Jason Gurda said a major question is why Community is abandoning its rural market strategy. "History makes us cautious, as most acquisitions of for- profit hospital companies by other for-profit hospital companies have not ended well," he said. A recent example is LifePoint Hospitals Inc.'s ( LPNT.O ) purchase of Province Healthcare Co. in 2005, a deal criticized in part for problems spurred by disputes between Province and doctors. Together, Community and Triad have 130 hospitals. Community is the sole provider in about 85 percent of its current markets, primarily in the U.S. Southeast and Southwest. Triad hospitals are located in the south and east of the United States. Areas of overlap between the companies include eastern Texas, Arkansas, Tennessee, Alabama, South Carolina and New Mexico, according to Stanford Group analyst Gary Lieberman. The U.S. hospital industry has been suffering through a long period of weak fundamentals, due in part to the rising numbers of patients without health insurance and slowing patient admissions amid escalating health-care costs. Community Health, which also said there is an opportunity to improve Triad's profit margins, withdrew its 2007 earnings forecast in light of the deal. Triad said it paid a termination fee for canceling the earlier private equity deal. It had agreed to a $20 million break-up fee and to reimburse up to $20 million for expenses. Fitch Ratings said the deal would likely require refinancing of Triad's current capital structure, which could push the community down several notches in its ratings. Monday's agreement is subject to approval by Triad shareholders and is expected to close in the third quarter. In New York Stock Exchange trading, Community finished down $2.02 to $34.78, while Triad rose $2.59 to $51.95. Tenet gained 15 cents, or 2.3 percent, to $6.50.
