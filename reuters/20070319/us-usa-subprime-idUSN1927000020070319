 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Confidence among U.S. homebuilders sank in March in data reported on Monday, while shares of subprime lender Accredited Home Lenders Holding Co. LEND.O plunged 12 percent for the day after the company said it was in talks about possible financing. 


 Falling house prices in the past year and rising defaults in the U.S. subprime mortgage market have unnerved financial markets in recent weeks, prompting concern that economic growth may be slowing. Yet, U.S. stocks rallied on Monday, helped by a burst of merger deals and suggesting investors believe the fallout in the subprime mortgage market can be contained. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  was up 1.1 percent and the Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  nearly 1 percent in mid-afternoon trade. Russell Read, chief investment officer at CalPERS, the biggest U.S. pension, said U.S. financial markets are likely to experience some fallout from troubles in subprime mortgage lending and there is likely be some contagion to the economy. But fallout to financial markets is likely to be limited, said Read of CalPERS, who helps oversee about $232 billion for California state workers. "We are concerned but not worried," he said. "This doesn't have the same overall negative consequences for the economy or for the state of California the way the Orange County collapse did," Read said, referring to the largest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history. Orange County sought bankruptcy protection in 1994 after it lost $1.6 billion in a losing bet on interest rate-sensitive securities. Confidence among U.S. homebuilders sank three percentage points in March from the previous month, the National Association of Home Builders said on Monday. The NAHB/Wells Fargo Housing Market index fell more than expected to 36 from a downwardly revised 39 a month earlier. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index would drop to drop to 38 from an originally reported 40 in February. Meanwhile, subprime mortgage lender Accredited saw its stock fall 12 percent decline after the company said it was in talks with a third party about possible financing, but the Nasdaq exchange warned that the stock could be delisted because the company has not filed its 2006 annual report. RESTRICTED STOCK SALE In other news in the subprime sector, the top five executives at NovaStar Financial Inc. NFI.N received restricted stock now worth about $1.6 million two days before said the battered subprime lender said it would cut 17 percent of its work force. The 350 job cuts, announced Friday evening, lifted NovaStar shares as much as 16 percent Monday morning on the New York Stock Exchange before they shed most of that gain. Investors in U.S. financial markets were also awaiting news this week from the Federal Reserve's interest-rate setting committee. Few economists are predicting a rate cut at this week's meeting, although 42 of 80 economists polled by Reuters March 9-14 expected a cut by the end of September.

"It will be extremely interesting to see what the Fed says on Wednesday and whether it decides to do a surprise rate cut to help offset what is appearing to be a bigger (housing) problem than originally envisioned," said Gary Balter, a Credit Suisse analyst who tracks companies, including Home Depot Inc. ( HD.N ), that are heavily exposed to the housing sector. U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary Robert Kimmitt said during a visit to Berlin on Monday that the U.S. economy remained in good shape and the housing market appeared to be stabilizing.
