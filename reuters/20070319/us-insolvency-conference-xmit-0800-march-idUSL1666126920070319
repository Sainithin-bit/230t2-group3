 CAPE TOWN  (Reuters) - A new wave of insolvencies will hit markets over the next few months - with more parties willing to profit from the pie than five years ago, when a cycle change sent dozens of companies into bankruptcy. 


 More than 400 restructuring lawyers, accountants and bankers will debate in Cape Town, South Africa, over the next two days when the downturn is expected and who is going to profit most from it. "People are definitely getting ready," said James Moylan, a managing director at Barclays Capital in charge of distressed debt. "We've seen pressure in the U.S. housing market. I suppose the market could turn quickly but default rates remain at all-time lows." Concerns about the U.S. housing market have pushed down stock markets around the world but, still, ample liquidity and investor appetite is suppressing debt payment failures. A sharp increase in defaults is not seen until next year, although pressure on sectors such as retail, chemicals and paper and packaging may mount over the next few months, market experts including credit rating agency Standard & Poor's have said. "There's a huge amount of leverage in the system," Moylan said. "Leverage buy-out deals continue to go higher, that leaves them very susceptible to an economic shock." European corporate debt levels rose to 5.4 times corporate profits in 2006, from 4.3 times in 2003, according to date from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. ( GS.N ). More debt is helping companies avoid insolvencies, and has made refinancings turn into the new restructurings, Lachlan Edwards, co-head of restructuring at Goldman Sachs in London, recently said. "This situation may not be sustainable in the long term," Moylan said. German auto parts maker Schefenacker, British printing company Polestar and Belgium's Ontex, a producer of nappy and feminine hygiene products, have already reached or are about to agree on a restructuring deal. "Current liquidity means that lending agreements have less bank protection," said Keith McGregor, a partner at accountancy firm Ernst & Young in London. "There is a risk that companies will be able to deteriorate a long way before lenders can take action, that might lead to more difficult turnarounds than we've seen in the past." MONEY WAITING Some asset managers and hedge funds are preparing for the next wave of insolvencies by raising funds to invest as opportunities arise, people familiar with the situation have told Reuters. Private equity firm 3i Group Plc ( III.L ) said last week it plans to invest up to 750 million euros in distressed companies and that it has hired two restructuring partners for the job. Restructuring specialists are in demand. Over the past few weeks, Goldman Sachs has hired Andrew Wilkinson, a top restructuring lawyer, from Cadwalader Wickersham & Taft LLP. Eric Coutts, Goldman's former co-head of restructuring, moved to the mergers and acquisitions unit of Citigroup ( C.N ) in Paris. Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ) said earlier this month it hired Soren Reynertson, head of restructuring at UBS AG ( UBSN.VX ), to expand its leverage finance unit. Andrew Merrett, former director of restructuring at Close Brothers CBG.L, recently moved to Rothschild ROT.L, replacing Lachlan Edwards, who moved to Goldman Sachs last summer. TENSION Difficulties are expected to arise in future restructurings as parties will have conflicting interests over the negotiating table. Only five years ago, a company and its senior creditors sat together with the aim of rescuing the company from insolvency. Now, the number of parties involved in a deal has increased dramatically, and some investors or creditors may profit more by letting the company go bust. In some cases, investors buy cheap debt of an ailing company, push it into bankruptcy -avoiding the pension deficit- expecting to turn their loans or bonds into equity, or profiting from an asset sale. "The increasing number of parties involved means that there may be more agendas at play than there would have been previously," E&Y's McGregor said. "Some of the agendas will be markedly different."
