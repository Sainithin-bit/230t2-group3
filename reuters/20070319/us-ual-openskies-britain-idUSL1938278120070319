 LONDON  (Reuters) - The head of United Airlines voiced support for a transatlantic air travel pact even though the company will have to confront the same prospect of new competition as British Airways BAY.L and Virgin Atlantic 


  VA.UL. Glenn Tilton, president, chairman and chief executive of the No. 2 U.S. carrier, urged EU transport ministers to back the "open skies" deal between the United States and the European Union. The pact, outlined by U.S. and EU negotiators this month and hailed as the most important air travel deal in decades, goes before ministers of the 27-nation bloc for review on Thursday. It "would benefit consumers on both sides of the Atlantic, bringing new competition to the world's largest aviation markets", Tilton said, writing in the Financial Times on Monday. "The U.S. is ready to sign, but some in Europe are urging the European Union council of transport ministers to reject the agreement, arguing that it is unbalanced in favor of the U.S." Tilton rejected such a suggestion, saying the "open skies" deal represented an important compromise. Britain's transport minister has voiced concern about the pact, citing risks to Virgin and BA. The deal would open London's Heathrow airport to more airlines, exposing the two British carriers to more competition at their main airport. Tilton, however, said UAL Corp.'s UAUA.O United Airlines and American Airlines AMR.N were in the same boat. The four carriers are the only ones allowed to fly from Heathrow to the United States under a deal signed in 1978. "United also confronts the prospect of new competition at Heathrow," he said. "However, we are prepared to accept the challenge of new competition in exchange for the long-term benefit of maintaining momentum toward international aviation deregulation. "And we are prepared to compete on a level playing field -- because reliance on protection from competition is not a strategy for lasting commercial success."
