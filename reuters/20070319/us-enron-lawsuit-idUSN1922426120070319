 HOUSTON  (Reuters) - Investment banks Merrill Lynch and Co. Inc. and Credit Suisse Group won a huge victory when a $40 billion class-action lawsuit filed by Enron Corp. investors was blocked by a federal appeals panel in New Orleans on Monday. 


 In a 53-page decision, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit wrote that U.S. District Judge Melinda Harmon's decision to grant class-action status to the case was partly based on "legal error" regarding the banks' liability, and sent the lawsuit back to the lower court for reconsideration. The banks had argued that Judge Harmon wrongly allowed investors to allege Merrill Lynch and Credit Suisse were primary participants in the fraud that eventually led to Enron's collapse. "We are very disappointed," said William Lerach, a lawyer for the Enron investor plaintiffs. "We respect the court, but we think the decision is clearly wrong." Lerach said the plaintiffs would seek a Supreme Court review of the appeals court's decision, which came just four weeks before the trial was scheduled to start on April 16. HOME RUN "It's a home run for the investment banks," Robert Zito, a partner at Schiff Hardin LLP in New York. "This decreases their exposure dramatically. They also have the war chests for these cases that individual plaintiffs do not." In court papers, Merrill Lynch had argued there was no evidence to prove it was a "substantial or significant factor" in the losses that caused Enron's collapse. A spokesman for Merrill said the investment bank was pleased by the decision, while a spokeswoman for Credit Suisse could not immediately be reached for comment. In a class-action lawsuit, investors consolidate their complaints, allowing them more clout than if claims were pursued on an individual basis. Lawyers had said a favorable ruling for the deep-pocketed banks would be a massive setback for the plaintiffs. "The appeals court is not saying out and out that the Lerach firm doesn't have a case," said Nancy Rapoport, a professor at the University of Houston law school. "This decision does not mean that they can't go plaintiff by plaintiff against the investment banks." She said, however, it was unlikely the case would proceed that way. So far, the lawsuit has netted more than $7 billion for investors, including $2 billion or more each from Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, J.P. Morgan and Citigroup. Enron filed for bankruptcy on December 2, 2001. The company's collapse erased thousands of Enron employees' pensions and billion of dollars in investors' money. In August, the same New Orleans appeals court overturned most of the convictions against four former Merrill Lynch bankers concerning a bogus barge deal with Enron.
