 BEIJING  (Reuters) - Talks on ending North Korea's nuclear threat will on Tuesday focus on how to disable the reactor at the heart of its atomic program and then begin mapping out future disarmament steps, the chief U.S. envoy said. 


 U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Christopher Hill said the six-party talks in Beijing would consider what happens after a mid-April deadline, when North Korea is due to shut the Yongbyon reactor in return for economic aid and security assurances spelled out in an initial February 13 agreement. Tasks after the deadline, Hill told reporters on Monday evening, would involve "disabling" the shut reactor and requiring that North Korea report other nuclear activities -- steps that promise to test the wary North. "We need to know what the full picture of their nuclear programs are, so that when they're abandoned and dismantled we've done all of it," Hill said. The six-party talks bring together North and South Korea, the United States, host China, Japan and Russia. They resumed late last year after North Korea's October 2006 nuclear test drew international condemnation and U.N. sanctions. At the breakthrough February meeting, Washington agreed to defuse North Korean anger about a bank crackdown that the North had cited as the reason it boycotted negotiations for over a year until last December. The bank impasse was overcome on Monday, Hill said, after the U.S. Treasury announced that $25 million in North Korean accounts frozen in Macau's Banco Delta Asia (BDA) would be released to Pyongyang. Washington had accused BDA of harboring North Korean earnings from international crime. North Korea has rejected the charges, and its envoy Kim Kye-gwan has said that his country wanted that money back before it shuts the Yongbyon plant, which makes plutonium that can be used in nuclear weapons. Kim has yet to say publicly whether Pyongyang thinks the U.S. announcement was acceptable. Some other envoys sounded hopeful. "Now that the BDA issue is resolved there should not be any major obstacles to implementing measures to shut down North Korea's nuclear facilities within 60 days," South Korea's chief negotiator Chun Yung-woo told reporters on Monday. The six-party talks scheduled to go through to Wednesday are also likely to discuss the other nuclear activities that North Korea must report, Hill said. Most thorny may be Pyongyang's role in highly enriched uranium (HEU) technology, which can be used to make the fissile material in nuclear weapons without running a tell-tale reactor. North Korea has denied enriching uranium. U.S. officials have recently steered away from the Bush administration's earlier claims that Pyongyang was close to mastering the complex process. Hill said Pyongyang needed to make a full declaration, including dealings with other countries. "Full means full, so there has to be some real clarity, understanding, on where we are in HEU," he said.
