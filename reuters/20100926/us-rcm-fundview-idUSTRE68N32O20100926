 LONDON  (Reuters) - Fund manager RCM's UK equities chief has backed a management reshuffle at banking giant HSBC ( HSBA.L ), whose stock he holds, and applauded a possible elevation of finance director Douglas Flint to the top job. 

 While the boardroom shake up has yet to be confirmed by the world's No. 3 bank, Jeremy Thomas, chief investment officer UK equities at RCM, said he "had a lot of time" for Flint and would welcome the news. "He's been very open, very honest, very helpful to us. So seeing him elevated to the chairmanship, if indeed that rumor is true, is not something that would alarm me at all." Existing HSBC bosses had displayed a lack of strategic focus on Asia, added Thomas, who oversees 1.5 billion pounds ($2.4 billion) in funds and actively manages the 44 million pound UK Equity A fund at RCM, a company of Allianz Global Investors. "It was obvious to us for a long time, perhaps before it was obvious to them, that they had this competitive advantage, that Asia should be their focus," he said. "I wouldn't have said that really any of the senior management, certainly the ex-chairman, Sir John Bond, or <current chairman Stephen> Green or <current CEO Michael> Geoghegan had been particularly far sighted," he added. Thomas said he had selectively added to his financials exposure since the start of the year, but was not particularly optimistic about the sector. "We don't see banks as materially undervalued, as some do, but we see pockets of growth interest," he said, citing insurer Aviva ( AV.L ), "which has been very much a laggard of the sector, both in share price terms as well as strategy." "At one stage it looked like they were trying to conquer the U.S., imitate Prudential in Asia and also be a sort of pan-European insurer, be a life insurer and also be a general insurer. "On a market cap of 10 billion pounds they were trying to emulate companies with a market cap of 30, 40, 50 billion pounds and they couldn't do that. But I think we're getting more clarity <on strategy> now," he said. The fund also continues to buy into the Resolution ( RSL.L ) insurance-sector consolidation story, he said, and fully expects to up its portfolio allocation to the Clive Cowdery-run firm after helping finance the AXA UK buy. At end-August, the fund's allocation to HSBC, Aviva and Resolution was 6.6 percent, 2.6 percent and 2.3 percent, respectively. The fund has returned 7.2 percent over the last 12 months, according to fund research firm Lipper, lagging rivals by 1.1 percentage points. It has also underperformed over three and five years. BANKING SECTOR CAUTION While stock selection could bring winners, the banking sector as a whole still had some way to go, Thomas said. "There's quite a lot to do on the government funding side, there's quite a lot to do on the regulatory side. We've seen Basel III, but we haven't seen a lot of detail. "Yesterday, I spent an hour talking with the finance director of the Royal Bank of Scotland and talked quite a lot about what they know and what they don't know. Really, what they know is what we know, and what they don't know is quite a lot." The sector is also pressured by its cyclicality and exposure to UK house prices, which are overvalued, he added. "Where goes the economy, goes the banks, ultimately," he said, citing the possibility of another dip in the housing market as key. While the rising interest rates that could precipitate that are unlikely in the short term, Thomas said he was "not really keen to invest in companies that are reliant on the house price remaining elevated."
