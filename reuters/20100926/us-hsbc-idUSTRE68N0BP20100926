 LONDON  (Reuters) - HSBC ( HSBA.L ) non-executive director John Thornton is to set to step down from the board of Europe's biggest bank within six months, the Financial Times said on Monday. 

 Change swept though HSBC on Friday as the bank named a new chairman, chief executive and finance director to repair its reputation after a shock boardroom bust-up. Thornton had been a top contender for the bank's chairmanship. The paper also said Thornton -- who has a wealth of experience in China -- had told associates he plans to step down by the time board members stand for re-election in the spring, unless the board convinces him that it will attach more importance to the country, now the world's second largest economy.
