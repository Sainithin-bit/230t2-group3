 LONDON  (Reuters) - Chinese food company Bright Food is in exclusive talks to buy Britain's United Biscuits for than 2 billion pounds ($3.13 billion), the Sunday Times reported. 

 Citing sources close to the deal, the newspaper said Shanghai-based Bright Foods had pre-empted a planned auction and was in secret talks to buy the maker of McVitie's and Twiglets for between 2 billion and 2.5 billion pounds. Reuters reported in July that United Biscuits' owners, private equity firms Blackstone ( BX.N ) and PAI Partners, were considering selling. Blackstone and Bright Food were not immediately available for comment. U.S. food group Campbell Soup Co ( CPB.N ) was weighing a bid, a source told Reuters in August. Bright Food, which recently lost a bidding war for Australian sugar refiner CSR ( CSR.AX ), is being advised in the talks by Rothschild, the Sunday Times said.
