 LONDON  (Reuters) - Some of Europe's banks are faced with the unusual problem of holding too much cash as they try to lift sluggish returns, and few will dare to eat into capital until well into 2011 amid an uncertain regulatory outlook. 

 A jump in profits may have prompted banks like HSBC and Barclays to talk about improving returns for investors, but the financial crisis is too fresh in the memory for regulators and bank bosses. "It's still too early. Returns have been pushed down by the capital, but even though Basel III has been pushed out and watered down there's still a nervousness at being seen to do anything other than build your capital," said Chris Wheeler, bank analyst at Mediobanca. "I think that will certainly go into next year." HSBC, the biggest bank outside China, is holding more capital than at any time in the last 20 years. That creates a big drag for its return on equity (RoE), a key measure of efficiency at making profit from the resources provided by investors. HSBC's RoE was 9.3 percent in the first half of the year, well short of its target of 15 to 19 percent. Barclays is another relative winner of the crisis, and like HSBC had to raise billions from investors to fatten up its capital cushion. Decent profits have swelled capital further and its RoE limped in at 9.8 percent in the first half, below its cost of capital. Nordic banks such as Swedbank and SEB have healthy capital positions and are facing increasing scrutiny on when weak returns will improve. "Assuming we don't go back into a recession the level of capital banks have will prove to be too great in the not too distant future," said Julian Cane, director of UK equities at fund manager F&C. "But until the (capital) rules are set in stone, they are all anxious not to pay too much of it back to shareholders." New rules requiring banks to hold more and better quality capital will be finalized in November. The reforms are less harsh than early proposals, but will still force banks to have a core Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 8 percent -- far above current minimum levels -- banking industry and regulation sources told Reuters this week.
