 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Dillard's Inc ( DDS.N ) reported a quarterly profit despite stagnant sales, as tighter inventory levels helped the retailer avoid discounts. 

 Dillard reported net income of $6.8 million, or 10 cents per share for its second quarter ended July 31, compared to a loss of $26.7 million, or 36 cents per share a year earlier. Revenue fell 2.4 percent $1.42 billion, while same-store sales, or sales at stores open at least a year, were unchanged from a year earlier. Gross margins rose 3.1 percentage points to 33 percent, helped by lower inventory levels, which fell by 6 percent. (Reporting by  Phil Wahba ; Editing by  Derek Caney )
