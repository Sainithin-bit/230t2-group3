 PRAGUE  (Reuters) - Countries in the EU's eastern wing grew faster than expected in the second quarter, clawing further out of deep contractions last year and raising the prospect of slightly higher full year growth forecasts. 

 Flash estimates from Hungary, Romania, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Bulgaria on Friday contained few details but tracked a surprisingly growth surge in Germany, the region's biggest export market and the main driver of the industry-based rebound. Euro zone member Slovakia led the pack, with 1.2 percent growth from the previous three months and a 4.6 percent expansion from a year ago. The Czechs grew 0.8 percent and 2.2 percent, a touch above forecast. Hungarian gross domestic product was flat on the quarter but up 1 percent on the year, and Romania emerged, likely only briefly, from a recession that has dogged it since the start of last year. Analysts said the data, fueled by bourgeoning demand in China and other Asian economies for European goods, could prompt policymakers to tweak their full year growth forecasts higher. But they added the countries, particularly Romania and Hungary, would face headwinds in the second half, while persistently weak domestic demand meant the recovery was still dependent on more developed western states. "Overall it has surprised us on the upside. We suspect basically this is largely due to exports to the euro area, and then as re-exports to Asia. We think that is what is driving this," said Peter Attard Montalto, an analyst at Nomura. "We see some kind of dip back, particularly in the Hungarian and Romanian numbers, in the second half of the year as we get the fuller impact of what's going on in each country." Bulgaria's economic decline slowed to 1.5 percent on an annual basis, compared with a 3.6 percent drop from January to March. Most analysts see the country showing around zero growth this year after a 5 percent drop in 2009. The region's currencies were little changed after the data. The Romanian leu was flat, and the Czech crown edged lower to 24.755 per euro. Czech bonds rallied on the long-end, with the 9-year yield a touch lower after hitting a lifetime low this week. Stock markets rose slightly, with up to 1 percent gains in Budapest and Bucharest by 4:56 a.m. EDT. HEADWINDS Second quarter growth in Germany, which takes anywhere from a fifth to a third of Czech, Slovak and Hungarian exports, hit 2.2 percent, its highest level since reunification. French and Austrian figures also bettered expectations. But there are many factors keeping economists on guard. A Thomson Reuters survey this week of foreign direct investors in emerging Europe showed recovery momentum was losing steam for the straight third quarter. After contractions last year ranging from 4 percent in the Czech Republic to 7.1 percent in Romania, unemployment is at or near double-digits in most of the region, forcing consumers to keep spending down and firms to hold back from investing. Other factors include a flagging U.S. recovery that could weaken demand for the components produced in the ex-communist region, and looming budget cuts from governments struggling to bring down high budget deficits and public debt. On Tuesday, the Czech central bank's chief statistician Tomas Holub said the Czech government's plans to cut the fiscal deficit next year to 4.6 percent of GDP, from 5.3 percent this year, was likely to cut growth by several tenths of a percent. But analysts said the strong second quarter data and positive figures out of Germany could allow them to push up their full year growth forecasts slightly to about 2 percent, compared with 1.6 percent forecast by the central bank. Romania's government has hiked consumption tax by 5 percent and cut public wages by 25 percent, moves analysts expect to lead to a quarter-on-quarter fall in growth from July to September. Hungary's annual 1 percent growth beat market forecasts for a 0.65 percent rise, but economists said a one-off tax aimed at siphoning off 200 billion forints from the banking sector would hit a weak lending environment and squeeze growth. "The prognosis for growth in 2011 (2.6 percent) remains cautious, seeing that the effect of the bank tax is still uncertain," said CIB bank analyst Gyorgy Barta.
