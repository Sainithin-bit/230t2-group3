 (Reuters) - Euro zone gross domestic product grew at its fastest pace in more than three years in the second quarter, boosted by a strong performance by Germany and France, but concerns remain that the rebound could falter. 

 European Union statistics agency Eurostat said GDP in the 16-nation currency zone expanded by 1.0 percent in the second quarter from the first, and by 1.7 percent versus the second quarter of 2009, matching a revised Reuters poll. Economists said the figures were the strongest in at least 3-1/2 years and showed euro zone growth outpacing that of the United States in the March-June period. ANALYSTS' COMMENTS HANS BEVERS, KBC "I think there was a common sense among economists that the second-quarter GDP figure would be very good, and it's actually better than expected. "As you can see in the country details you see that it's all about Germany who is benefitting and has been benefitting the most from this global trade revival. "But in the next quarters we expect there to be a sort of easing. There will be growth but it will be less than we've seen in the second quarter as Europe will normally follow the U.S. where we've seen also this easing in the last couple of months. "It's not a double-dip scenario, certainly not, but there will be a sort of easing. But Germany is a class apart." ASTRID SCHILO, EUROPEAN ECONOMIST WITH HSBC. "Germany is able to respond quickly to pick-ups in global demand. They have the goods that people want. That is what we are seeing in these numbers. But we have to remember it can contract just as quickly." ELGA BARTSCH, EUROPEAN ECONOMIST, MORGAN STANLEY "This is smack in line with our expectations, and it's reassuring to see it confirmed by the data, but there have been a number of one-off factors." She said retail spending had been spurred by the fine weather and the World Cup, industry had been aggressively restocking, and the construction industry had undergone a springtime revival. "I think in the second half we'll see a renewed moderation of growth. This sets us up for 1.5 percent GDP growth in the full year." NICK KOUNIS, ABN AMRO ECONOMIST "The outcome is significantly stronger than the consensus estimates. It was always on the cards following the strong German GDP. "In terms of sentiment, we have seen a remarkable turnaround in terms of how people view euro-zone growth. The worries related to sovereign debt and the banking sector appeared to have eased. "But that's too optimistic a picture, the sovereign debt crisis is not entirely over. Also we see a slowdown in the global industry. Domestic demand in Europe remains weak, with consumer spending slowing down. "The Q2 numbers are very impressive, but a slowdown looms ahead for the European economy. "The ECB expects these kind of numbers following good data we have seen monthly in the last few months, their sense is this probably paints an exaggerated picture of the European economy. "They stuck to their view that the recovery would be moderate. But if the data holds up as well as they seem, then ECB rate hikes may come sooner than the market expected." SPEAKING AHEAD OF RELEASE OF EURO ZONE DATA JENNIFER MCKEOWN, ECONOMIST AT CAPITAL ECONOMICS "Q2 GDP data for the euro-zone's major economies suggest that the region performed very well, both by its own and international standards. Data for seven of the region's largest economies point to a quarterly gain of about 0.9 percent in the euro-zone as a whole. "This would be the strongest in 3 1/2 years and mean that, unusually, growth in the euro-zone outpaced that in the US. But the recovery still looks worryingly lop-sided. "Looking ahead, the peripheral economies will continue to suffer from fiscal tightening and look set to remain in, or return to, recession. Meanwhile, the German recovery will weaken as global demand slows and its own fiscal consolidation begins next year. In all, then, while the surveys suggest that the euro-zone's strong performance might continue into the third quarter, it seems unlikely to last much beyond that."
