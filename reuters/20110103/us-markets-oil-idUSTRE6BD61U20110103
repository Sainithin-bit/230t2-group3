 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Oil prices rose to a 27-month peak on Monday as upbeat European and U.S. manufacturing data and forecasts for cold weather reinforced optimism about economic and energy demand growth. 

 Manufacturing in the United States and Europe accelerated in December and growth in China and India slowed to a more sustainable level, helping to fuel a move by investors into riskier assets. U.S. crude oil for February delivery rose 17 cents to settle at $91.55 a barrel, its highest settlement since early October 2008, after earlier rising as high as $92.58. Crude oil prices pulled back late in the open outcry session after the U.S. Interior Department said it will allow 13 companies to resume deepwater drilling in the Gulf of Mexico without an additional environmental review. In London, ICE Brent crude for February rose 9 cents to settle at $94.84 a barrel, also the highest close since October 2008. Strong U.S. heating oil and ICE gas oil futures helped spark the oil futures complex strength, boosted by expectations more freezing weather is on tap for later in January. U.S. crude oil futures were building on their end-of-year rally that left prices up 15 percent for 2010. Total U.S. crude futures trading volume, thinned by the holiday season, was above 396,000 lots with 1-1/2 hours left in post-settlement trading. The 30-day average was 543,282. "Heating oil strength is on the colder forecasts further out, and on top of that crude is being supported by the strong manufacturing data," said Phil Flynn, analyst at PFGBest Research in Chicago. Total U.S. heating demand this week was expected to be only 0.5 percent above normal, the U.S. National Weather Service said, and heating oil demand 4.3 percent below normal. But looking further out, the NWS' six- to 10-day and eight- to 14-day outlook issued Sunday called for below-normal or much-below-normal readings for the entire nation. Temperatures in northern Europe also were forecast to be near to below normal in the six- to 10-day outlooks, according to private forecaster DTN Meteorlogix. GROWTH OPTIMISM SUPPORTS PRICES The fresh batch of encouraging economic data helped lift U.S. equities, pushing all three major indexes up more than 1 percent to start the new year. .N U.S. manufacturing grew for a 17th straight month in December. The Institute for Supply Management report showed new orders rose, but factory sector employment slipped to a nine-month low. U.S. construction spending rose in November to touch its highest level in five months. Prior to the U.S. reports, investors received news that the official Chinese purchasing managers' index edged down in December, easing concerns about more efforts by China's government to cool off its economy. The Markit Eurozone PMI, which records manufacturing activity across the major euro-area economies, rose in December from November to near April's 46-month high. While oil prices are pushing toward $100 a barrel three years after crude first broke triple digits, analysts say spare production and refining capacity should prevent a repeat of the 2008 run up to $147 a barrel. Analysts believe that OPEC members, especially Saudi Arabia, would likely step in and add production to ensure the economic recovery is not derailed. (Factbox on key differences between 2008 and 2011 for oil markets: CONTANGO U.S. crude futures remain in a stubborn contango, whereby prompt oil is cheaper than barrels for later delivery, a market condition that encourages storage. The spread between front-month February and March crude futures had the premium for March crude as high as $1 intraday on Monday. Some brokers thought positions being rolled into the March contract may have helped curb the gains of front-month futures.
