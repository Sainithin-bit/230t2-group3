 NICOSIA  (Reuters) - Euro zone finance ministers agreed unanimously at a Eurogroup teleconference on Sunday on how to help Greece if needed, Cyprus' finance minister told reporters. 

 "We agreed on the specific way by which member states, with the IMF, will offer economic assistance to Greece if it asks," Charilaos Stavrakis said. Euro zone finance ministers met to detail how a safety net for debt-stricken Greece would work if it asks to trigger it. "We have concluded both on the details, and the precise manner by which the aid would be activated," Stavrakis said. "It was unanimous." Stavrakis declined to spell out the details of the deal. "Certainly it is something positive for Greece, but the issue which remains is if Greece requests it," he said. (Reporting by  Michele Kambas ; Writing by  Ingrid Melander ; editing by Mike Nesbit)
