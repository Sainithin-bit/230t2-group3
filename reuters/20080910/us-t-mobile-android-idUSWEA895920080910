 FRANKFURT/DUESSELDORF  (Reuters) - Deutsche Telekom's T-Mobile unit is set to start selling a mobile phone based on Google Inc's Android software within weeks, according to people familiar with the matter. 

 "T-Mobile and Google will be making an announcement this month in New York City," two people told Reuters on Wednesday, adding Sept 23 was a likely date for the announcement. T-Mobile declined to comment and Google was not immediately available. (Reporting by  Nicola Leske  and Nikola Rotscheroth)
