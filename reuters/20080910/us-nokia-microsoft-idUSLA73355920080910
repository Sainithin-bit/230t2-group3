 HELSINKI  (Reuters) - Nokia Oyj ( NOK1V.HE ) said on Wednesday it has signed a deal with Microsoft ( MSFT.O ) to expand corporate e-mail access to 80 million Nokia phones as the world's top handset maker battles Blackberry-maker RIM RIM.TO. 

 Nokia said it will enable access to Microsoft's Exchange ActiveSync e-mail from all Nokia phones using latest edition of S60 software, with around 80 million such phones sold so far. "Nokia owners whose companies use Exchange can set up Mail for Exchange for free on their devices in various ways without paying additional services or subscription fees," Nokia said in a statement.
