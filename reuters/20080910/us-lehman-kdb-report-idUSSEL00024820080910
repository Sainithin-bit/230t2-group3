 SEOUL  (Reuters) - State-run Korea Development Bank is seeking a controlling stake in Lehman Brothers for about $6 billion, Yonhap reported on Wednesday, citing a high ranking KDB official. 

 South Korean news agency Yonhap quoted the unnamed official as saying the two sides were negotiating and the deal's size was larger than the 25 percent stake mentioned in previous reports. (Reporting by Cheon Jong-woo; Editing by Keiron Henderson)
