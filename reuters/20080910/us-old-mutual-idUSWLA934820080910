 LONDON  (Reuters) - British insurer Old Mutal ( OML.L ) said on Wednesday Chief Executive Jim Sutcliffe would resign with immediate effect, and would be replaced by Julian Roberts. 

 A statement gave no reason for Sutcliffe's resignation. Roberts is the former head of Skandia. In a separate statement it also said it would take writedowns of $135 million in the value of preferred stock of Fannie Mae FNM.N and Freddie Mac FRE.N held by Old Mutual's US life business.
