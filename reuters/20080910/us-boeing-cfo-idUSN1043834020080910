 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Boeing Co's ( BA.N ) chief financial officer said on Wednesday he would be happy if the strike by the company's machinists were resolved in a month, but warned that the work stoppage could be more costly than the previous month-long strike in 2005. 

 "I'd be pleased with that timing," said Boeing CFO James Bell, speaking at an investor conference broadcast on the Internet, when asked if the strike would last a month. Almost 27,000 Boeing workers walked off the job on Saturday after the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) failed to reach agreement on a new contract with Boeing. The company has stopped plane production at its massive Seattle-area plants. The IAM has struck against Boeing four times in the last 20 years, with the previous strike in 2005 lasting 28 days. That strike took about 30 cents per share off Boeing's earnings for the year. The impact this time around would be "more severe" as the company has ramped up plane production since then and has higher profit margins, said Bell. No further contract talks are planned and the two sides remain far apart on several issues, said Bell, although he said it should be possible to find a balance on the crucial issue of outsourcing. Bell said every day of the strike added a day to the schedule of key programs such as the 787 Dreamliner, and possibly more, but at this stage it was "hard to tell" if first delivery of the 787 would slip into 2010. The company is currently projecting first delivery of its 787 in the third quarter of 2009, more than a year after its original target of May 2008, after production problems caused a series of delays.
