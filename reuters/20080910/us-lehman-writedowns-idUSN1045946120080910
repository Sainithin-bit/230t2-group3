 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc announced a loss of $3.93 billion on Tuesday and $5.6 
billion in write-downs for the third quarter. 

 The firm has posted over $18 billion in credit losses and 
write-downs since the global credit crisis began, largely due 
to mortgage and structured debt positions. Banks and other financial firms around the world have taken 
over $420 billion on credit-related write-downs and losses 
since the credit crunch hit in the third quarter of 2007.
