 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank Securities Inc has agreed to pay a $575,000 fine for short-selling violations in the largest penalty to date from NYSE Regulation. 

 NYSE Regulation, the watchdog arm of the New York Stock Exchange NYX.NNYX.PA, said on Wednesday that Deutsche Bank Securities made a significant number of short sales in securities that were not on the firm's easy-to-borrow list between January 2005 and October 2006. It said the firm completed the sales without borrowing the securities or having reasonable grounds that they could be borrowed. Short sellers arrange to borrow shares they consider overvalued and sell them in hopes of making a profit when the price drops. Deutsche Bank Securities is the U.S. investment banking and securities arm of German banking giant Deutsche Bank AG ( DBKGn.DE ). A spokesman from Deutsche Bank said the firm was pleased to resolve the matter. Robert Marchman, head of NYSE Regulation's division of enforcement and risk, said the case against Deutsche involved failures to locate the securities to cover the short sales, not necessarily a failure to deliver the securities. A failure to deliver is associated with so-called naked short selling -- the subject of a recent U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission emergency rule designed to crack down on abusive short selling. "The crux of this case is really the fact they didn't have adequate procedures in place to be able to locate the securities," Marchman said. NYSE Regulation also found that two of Deutsche Bank Securities' trading desks incorrectly marked an unquantified but significant number of short sale orders as long, and some of the incorrectly marked short sale orders were improperly executed. Deutsche Bank consented to a censure and the fine without admitting or denying the violations. The regulator also said Wednesday it fined Citigroup ( C.N ) Global Markets Inc $235,000 for various trading violations. The regulator found the company, the brokerage and securities arm of Citigroup Inc, entered proprietary trades ahead of or along with customer orders from January 2004 through November 2006. It said the firm either did not obtain permission from institutional customers or did not properly follow the provisions of customer permission as documented. NYSE Regulation also found that from February 2007 through October 2007, Citigroup Global Markets failed to properly record, maintain and transmit certain data related to orders in various NYSE securities. The firm agreed to the censure and penalty without admitting or denying the violations. It did not immediately return a call seeking comment.
