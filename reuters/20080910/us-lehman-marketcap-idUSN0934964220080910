 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The 45 percent slide in the shares of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc on Tuesday reduced the investment bank's market value to just $5.4 billion -- down from $36 billion a year ago. 

 The firm's stock market value is now equivalent to: -- One-twelfth the value of Goldman Sachs Co Inc -- One-eighth the value of Merrill Lynch Co Inc -- One-fifth the value of discount broker Charles Schwab -- Half the value of online discount broker TD Ameritrade -- About double the sale price for one New York office building, the GM Building, when it was sold in May -- Five days of Wal-Mart Stores Inc sales -- About half the earnings reported by Exxon Mobil in the second quarter.
