 SYDNEY  (Reuters) - Fitch Ratings said it had put U.S. investment bank Lehman Holdings Ltd on ratings watch negative, warning any downgrade could be by more than one notch and come in the near-term. 

 Fitch said its main concerns related to ongoing losses in commercial and residential mortgage-related assets, no reduction of less liquid assets, increasing leverage, diminishing common capital and impairment to reputation or other factors that limit Lehman's ability to exercise the power of its franchise. "Fitch will maintain on open dialogue with management, and assess ongoing performance with the expectation of resolving the Rating Watch Negative designation within the next 90 days," Fitch said in a statement monitored in Sydney. Lehman's shares slid 45 percent on Tuesday on concerns it was struggling to raise desperately needed capital. (Reporting by  Wayne Cole ; Editing by  Jonathan Standing  )
