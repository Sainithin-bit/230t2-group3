 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Bill Gross, chief investment officer of Pacific Investment Management Co. said on Wednesday that Pimco is still doing business with Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. 

 Asked on CNBC television whether Pimco was still doing business with the struggling U.S. investment bank, Gross, who is manager of the world's biggest bond fund said. "We are still doing business with them." Gross manages the $132 billion Pimco Total Return Fund, one of the largest U.S. bond funds. "They (Lehman) have made some mistakes, but have a positive equity and some good assets to take forward," Gross said. Although there have been questions about Lehman's need for capital, "they have access to the discount window", Gross noted. The discount window is a Federal Reserve conduit of funding available to financial institutions who need it. But he added that banks are not in a position to sell a lot of stock right now and that other "policy moves may be needed" going forward. Lehman reported a much-larger-than-expected third quarter loss on Wednesday and said it plans to sell a majority stake in its investment management division and spin off commercial real estate assets in an attempt to raise capital.  Its shares last traded little changed on  Wednesday after a 45 percent plunge in the prior session, amid investors' growing concerns about its capital situation. On the government's weekend takeover of mortgage finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, Gross told CNBC that he liked the plan by Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson for the agencies because "it lowers mortgage rates and helps support housing prices."
