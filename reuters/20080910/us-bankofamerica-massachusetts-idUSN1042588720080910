 BOSTON  (Reuters) - Bank of America Corp ( BAC.N ) agreed on Wednesday to buy back billions of dollars in illiquid securities to settle a probe that had been initiated by the state of Massachusetts, sending its shares down nearly 3 percent. 

 Starting on October 1, the bank will buy back all illiquid auction-rate securities at par value from roughly 5,500 retail customers around the country, Massachusetts Secretary of State and top securities regulator William Galvin said. Bank of America said it would spend roughly $4.5 billion for the repurchase of the securities and take a pretax charge of about $275 million. The company said it expected minimal capital impact from bringing the assets onto its balance sheet. For customers who were assured that auction-rate securities were safe, the matter has been more urgent, Galvin said. "This has been a terrible dislocation for people, and we have made it a priority to get the money back to people who need it the most first," Galvin told Reuters. Bank of America shares were down 2.8 percent at $31.60 in morning New York Stock Exchange trade. Massachusetts, one of the first states to probe auction-rate securities when the market seized up earlier this year, has already reached similar settlements with UBS AG ( UBSN.VX ) and Merrill Lynch MER.N. Now the state will focus more on secondary sellers of auction-rate securities, Galvin said. "We have now trained our guns on them," he said, referring to brokerages like home-state mutual fund giant Fidelity Investments, which did not issue the debt but acted as a middleman for clients who wanted it. Galvin has urged Fidelity to buy back the securities that it sold and that later became illiquid. (Reporting by Svea Herbst-Bayliss; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn)
