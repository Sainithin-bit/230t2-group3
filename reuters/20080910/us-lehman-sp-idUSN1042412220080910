 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The $3.93 billion third-quarter loss that Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc posted on Wednesday will reduce projected earnings by companies in the S&P 500 Index by 1 percent, Standard & Poor's said. 

 The Lehman loss will cut the projected operating earnings-per-share for the S&P 500 Index by 21 cents, according to Howard Silverblatt, S&P's senior index analyst. After the market closed on Tuesday, the projected third-quarter EPS for the S&P 500 was $21.66, Silverblatt said. (Reporting by  Herbert Lash , Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)
