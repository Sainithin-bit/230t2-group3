 SEOUL  (Reuters) - Korea Development Bank (KDB) is no closer to a deal with Lehman Brothers <LEH.N and talks with the U.S. bank have not resumed, a government official with direct knowledge of the situation told Reuters on Wednesday. 

 "My knowledge is that both sides have not got closer in terms of a deal," he said. The official, who asked not to be identified, was responding to Reuters questions after South Korean news agency Yonhap earlier on Wednesday reported that KDB was still seeking a controlling stake in the troubled U.S. investment bank. That report from Yonhap appeared to conflict with comments on Wednesday morning from a different government official that KDB had ended talks with Lehman due to lack of progress.
