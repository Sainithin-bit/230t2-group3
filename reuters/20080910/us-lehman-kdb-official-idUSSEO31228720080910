 SEOUL  (Reuters) - Korea Development Bank (KDB) has made an offer for a possible investment in Lehman Brothers and is waiting for a response, a KDB official in charge of the talks told Reuters on Wednesday. 

 "Our proposal has been delivered to them, and they are reviewing it," the official said on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter. "Considering all circumstances, it looks difficult to reach a deal." (Reporting by Lee Chang-ho, Writing by Kim Yeon-hee; Editing by Keiron Henderson)
