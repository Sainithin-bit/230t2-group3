 (Reuters) - With U.S. unemployment at 9 percent and expected to fall only slowly, Federal Reserve officials are debating the costs and benefits of another round of monetary policy easing. 
 Below is a quick guide to the views of those policy makers who have expressed their inclinations on the subject: Fed Governor Ed Tarullo General stance: Has said further easing might be needed Trigger: Economy would have to fail to get better Preferred policy: Mortgage-backed securities purchases Chicago Fed President Charles Evans General stance: Has said further easing is needed Trigger: None needed; unemployment is already far too high Preferred policy: Promise low rates until unemployment falls below 7 percent, or inflation threatens to top 3 percent; if adopting policy triggers works too slowly, buy more bonds. San Francisco Fed President John Williams General stance: Has said further easing may be needed Trigger: Economy would have to develop in line with his expectations of inflation falling to 1.5 percent and GDP growing by 3 percent next year. Preferred policy: If Fed buys bonds, mortgage-backed securities would provide "extra kick"; regardless of need for easing, Fed should give clear road map on policy. New York Fed President William Dudley General stance: Has said easing may be needed Trigger: Economy would have to fail to improve Preferred policy: Mortgage-backed securities purchases; desirable to specify what unemployment, inflation rates would trigger policy change. Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren General stance: Has said easing may be needed Trigger: Growth would have to fall short of forecast, threat of deflation would have to reappear, Europe would have to deliver shock. Preferred policy: Should consider tying monetary policy to specific economic triggers; bond purchases Minneapolis Fed President Narayana Kocherlakota General stance: Has said easing is not needed Trigger: Economy would have to deteriorate Preferred policy: Publish "public contingency plan" laying out Fed's response to a range of economic scenarios; if conditions call for easing under plan, buy Treasuries or extend low-rate promise. Atlanta Fed President Dennis Lockhart General stance: Has said easing is not needed Trigger: Would have to see recession, deflationary pressures, rising unemployment Preferred policy: Bond buying; favors explicit inflation target. Dallas Fed President Richard Fisher General stance: Has said easing is not needed, Fed has done enough Trigger: Would have to have shock to economy Philadelphia Fed President Charles Plosser General stance: Has said easing is not needed Trigger: Only warranted if economy deteriorates Preferred policy: Favors explicit inflation target Richmond Fed President Jeffrey Lacker General stance: Has said easing is not needed Preferred policy: No mortgage-backed securities purchases (Reporting by  Ann Saphir ; Editing by Leslie Adler)
