 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Television advertisers appear cautious in their spending for the final months of the year, News Corp Chief Operating Officer Chase Carey said on Tuesday. 
 The London Olympics on NBC grabbed a large share of third-quarter ad spending, Carey said, but the fourth quarter of 2012 will be "a bit better" for News Corp. "I think you've got a market that is pretty reserved and pretty cautious," Carey told analysts after the company reported its quarterly results. "I think markets overall are OK, not great," he said.
