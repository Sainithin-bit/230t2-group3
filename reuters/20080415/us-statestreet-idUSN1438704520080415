 BOSTON  (Reuters) - State Street Corp ( STT.N ) reported stronger than expected earnings on Tuesday but its stock price tumbled nearly 10 percent amid fears it might face $1.5 billion in losses on mortgage-backed debt funds. 

 The company, one of the world's biggest institutional asset managers, said it faces $1.5 billion in unrealized after-tax losses on four funds, known as conduits. The funds are off-balance-sheet investment pools that held $28.3 billion in assets at the end of March. State Street, which also earns fees for providing back-office services to investment managers, said it bought $850 million of securities from the conduits and moved them on the balance sheet, losing $11.5 million in the process. At the same time, State Street also has $3.2 billion in unrealized losses on its investment portfolio. Even though State Street executives said the AAA-rated assets are performing well, investors worried that the Boston-based company, whose share price rose over 15 in the last year because it largely avoided the deepening credit crisis, might now be forced to shore up the funds with its own money. State Street Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Ron Logue said the company has no indication that it will have to realize these losses and said he has no plans to cut the dividend, as other companies that have faced similar woes have done. Many other big banks and investment managers had to prop up ailing funds and needed new liquidity themselves after their subprime mortgage bets soured. "This is the conservative, pristine State Street that has taken on risk now that many investors were not prepared for," RBC Capital analyst Gerard Cassidy said, explaining why the share price tumbled even though earnings were strong. Fitch Ratings put State Street on "rating watch negative," which means it may cut its debt, and analysts at Punk Ziegel cut the company's price target to $94 from $105. This stands in sharp contrast to State Street's 69 percent gain in net income, which climbed to $530 million or $1.35 per share, in the first quarter, and topped Wall Street's $1.30 per share estimate. A year ago, State Street earned $314 million, or 93 cents per share. Revenue hit a record $2.6 billion as the company integrated Investors Financial Services Corp, a rival it bought in 2007, and businesses like its securities financing unit and trading services fared well. In light of the strong numbers, Logue stuck by his cautiously optimistic forecast that profit would likely rise between 10 percent to 15 percent this year. "Business continues to be very strong," Logue said in an interview, adding "I'll stack our numbers against anyone's." Logue also said the company, which took a $279 million charge in the fourth quarter to settle lawsuits tied to losses on mortgage market investments, likely won't have to add to that in the coming quarters. The company recently appointed Scott Powers, a Boston-based mutual fund company executive, to run State Street's investment arm after its previous head resigned in the wake of the mortgage market losses last year. State Street's stock closed down 9.93 percent, or $7.63, at $69.23. By contrast, State Street's rival Northern Trust Corp ( NTRS.O ) which reported a 24 percent rise in first-quarter operating earnings to a record $231.7 million, or $1.03 a share, saw its share price jump 4.7 percent. "Northern Trust has always been regarded as a very conservative and a very safe company. It did have a large positive surprise," said Nancy Bush, managing member of NAB Research LLC in Aiken, South Carolina, who had been expecting the company to earn 93 cents per share.
