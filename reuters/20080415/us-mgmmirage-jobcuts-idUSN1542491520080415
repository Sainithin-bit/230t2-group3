 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Las Vegas casino operator MGM Mirage ( MGM.N ) has said it is cutting 440 jobs, the Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday, signaling the effect of a slowing economy on the casino industry. 

 A significant part of the cuts will be made in Las Vegas where MGM Mirage owns 10 properties, the report said, quoting the casino operator's spokesman Alan Feldman. "It's no secret: Business levels are down," Feldman was quoted as saying in the report. MGM Mirage representatives were not immediately available for comment.
