 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The chief executive of Delta Air Lines Inc ( DAL.N ) said on Tuesday he does not foresee any regulatory block to the company's $3.63 billion purchase of rival Northwest Airlines Corp NWA.N. 

 The deal, which aims to create the world's largest airline by traffic and the leading U.S. domestic carrier, is the biggest in the history of the U.S. air industry and is expected to get a thorough review by regulators to ensure it does not impede competition. "The regulatory issue is going to be confined to the United States," Delta CEO Richard Anderson said in an interview on CNBC on Tuesday, referring to last week's Department of Transportation decision to grant Northwest antitrust immunity in coordinating schedules with its SkyTeam alliance partners, including Delta. "In the United States we have not quite 20 percent market share," he said. "You still have many other carriers, including many discount carriers, that have free access to every market in the United States." The Bush administration, seen as broadly friendly to airline mergers, gave no indication of immediate objection to the Delta deal, announced late on Monday. "The Justice Department has the lead role in reviewing proposed airline mergers due to its primary jurisdiction over antitrust laws," White House spokesman Scott Stanzel said in a written statement on Tuesday, when asked for White House reaction to the proposed deal. "The Department of Transportation will work with the Department of Justice by providing advice and analysis on airline competition issues, as they have done in other merger cases," he added. In a separate interview on NBC, Anderson said he was hoping to win over Northwest's pilots, despite the lack of any agreement between Delta and Northwest pilots, which the airline had originally aimed to achieve before a deal was announced. "We're going to work hard, and we tried very hard to have an agreement with both the Northwest and Delta pilots," Anderson said in an earlier interview on NBC's "Today" show, addressing an issue that some analysts say could pose a serious block to a successful merger. "We want to have, prior to closing, an agreement with both the Northwest and Delta pilots," he added. "We're halfway there, it's part of the process and we think we'll be successful in getting the Northwest pilots under the Delta collective bargaining agreement with a resolution on the seniority between the two groups prior to closing."
