 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Concern that the U.S. economy will slip 
into a recession is rising, Japanese Economics Minister Hiroko 
Ota said on Tuesday, adding that any impact on the Japanese 
economy will depend on how long the U.S. downturn lasts. 

  "We have said the U.S economy has been slowing but concerns 
are rising that there will be a recession given the fall in 
consumption and employment," Ota told a news conference after a 
cabinet meeting. (Reporting by  Hideyuki Sano ; Editing by Hugh
