 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Cigarette maker Philip Morris USA said on Tuesday it made its full payment of about $4 billion to U.S. states as required under a 1998 settlement agreement, while rival R.J. Reynolds put some of its payment into an escrow account. 

 The payment choices by the two largest U.S. cigarette makers represent different ways of dealing with amounts they argue should not be paid because they have lost market  share to tobacco companies that are not part of the settlement agreement. R.J. Reynolds, a unit of Reynolds American Inc ( RAI.N ), agreed to pay $2.25 billion to the states under the Master Settlement Agreement. The funds are intended to help cover the medical bills of ailing smokers. But Reynolds also put $431 million in an escrow account for "disputed payments." On the other hand, Philip Morris, a unit of Altria Group Inc ( MO.N ), included in its payment about $156 million it disputes it owes. "We continue to work in good faith with the states to resolve the Non-Participating Manufacturer adjustment dispute, whether by settlement or by the arbitration process specified by the Master Settlement Agreement," said Denise Keane, executive vice president and general counsel, Altria Group, Inc. But 47 of 48 state trial courts have determined conflicts over the settlement agreement should be decided by binding arbitration, according to Reynolds spokesman David Howard. A number of states had wanted to fight the matter in state court, so arbitration has yet to begin. U.S. states, counties and cities have sold more than $32 billion of municipal bonds that are repaid by the annual payments cigarette makers agreed to make. Trading in this sector was particularly active ahead of the April 15 deadline as investors fretted about how much Big Tobacco might put into escrow, explained Michael Marz, vice chairman, First Southwest Co in Dallas. "I think the market was kind of overreacting" to fears that payments would be slashed, he said. For example, in the last couple of weeks, yields on bonds with an average life of 2040 to 2047 shot up about 15-20 basis points to 6.40 percent. The prices of these bonds move in the opposite direction of the yields. But in the last couple of days, these yields slipped back down to about 6.30 percent and trading slackened, he said. Altria shares were up 5 cents at $21.59 on Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange and Reynolds' shares were down 6 cents at $57.81.
