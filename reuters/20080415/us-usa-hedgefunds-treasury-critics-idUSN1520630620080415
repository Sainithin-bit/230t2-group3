 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Critics blasted a Treasury Department call for the $1.8 trillion hedge fund industry to better police itself, saying voluntary guidelines did little to protect investors and regulate the pools of capital. 

 Instead, the guidelines should be mandatory and federal regulations are needed to oversee the fast-growing hedge fund industry, they said. "This plan is one small step when giant strides are needed," said Richard Blumenthal, attorney general for Connecticut, where about a third of the world's hedge funds are located. "Non-binding best practices or voluntary guidelines are an imaginary fence and virtual farce. They stop nothing." The Treasury Department unveiled on Tuesday guidelines for hedge fund best practices recommended by two private sector committees to ensure that the funds do not trigger systemic problems as their role on Wall Street increases. Hedge fund managers should improve disclosures of hard-to-value assets such as mortgage-backed securities, which have fueled the current credit crisis and market turmoil, the panels said. But critics said the recommendations should have gone further to protect investors. The Securities and Exchange Commission currently has limited supervision over hedge funds, loosely-regulated pools of capital are able to take risky positions, such as selling short, which more conservative mutual funds avoid. "We need regulations with real teeth that require registration, increased disclosure and strict standards for risk management," said Rich Ferlauto, director of pension and benefit policy for the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees union. The new documents "offer no additional safeguards for investors, other than to simply repeat the current due diligence responsibilities of fiduciaries," Ferlauto said. One Treasury-selected committee, composed of asset managers, said hedge fund managers should adopt the key principles of U.S. public company disclosure standards such as quarterly and annual reports, timely disclosures of material events and audited financial statements. The other panel, composed of investor groups, said pension funds, endowment funds and other investment fiduciaries should have written procedures to determine whether hedge fund investments are appropriate for their objectives and risk profiles. David Tittsworth, executive director with the Investment Adviser Association, called the plan a piecemeal approach. "What is probably needed is some kind of centralized regulatory treatment," said Tittsworth. His group represents about 500 firms that collectively manage about $9 trillion in assets. The SEC tried to glimpse into the highly secretive industry by requiring hedge fund advisers to register with the agency, but that rule was thrown out by a federal court in 2006. In 2007, the investor protection agency adopted a rule that allows it to sue hedge fund advisers who defraud those who invest or intend to invest in the funds. SEC spokesman John Nester said the SEC supports best practices, "but recognizes that they are no substitute for the rigorous enforcement of the securities laws exercised by the SEC."
