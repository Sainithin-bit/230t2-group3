 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company ( RAI.N )> 
on Wednesday said it paid U.S. states $2.251 billion under the 
master settlement agreement that ended their lawsuits over 
smokers' medical bills. 

  But the cigarette maker added it put $431 million into an 
escrow account for "disputed payments." The settlement allows 
companies to take this approach if the accord causes them to 
lose market share to rivals that did not sign on.  (Reporting by  Joan Gralla , Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)
