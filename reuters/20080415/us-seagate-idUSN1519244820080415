 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Seagate Technology STX.N, the world's largest computer disk-drive maker, posted a higher quarterly profit on Tuesday but gave a muted current-period outlook, saying it fell short of its expectations in the laptop-computer and retail markets. 

 Net income in Seagate's fiscal third quarter increased to $344 million, or 65 cents per share, from $212 million, or 37 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding charges for restructuring and other items, profit was 74 cents per share, beating the average analyst estimate of 70 cents per share as compiled by Reuters Estimates. Revenue rose to $3.1 billion from $2.83 billion but was shy of the company's earlier projection of $3.2 billion to $3.3 billion. Analysts, on average, expected revenue of $3.25 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. "We continue to believe that there is significant opportunity in the notebook and retail markets, two areas where the company recently has not performed to expectation," Chief Executive Bill Watkins said in a statement. He added that Seagate expects "improved performance in these areas in the June quarter and through the calendar year." Seagate in March raised its third-quarter net income forecast to a range of 63 cents to 72 cents per share from an earlier projection of 57 cents to 61 cents per share, citing a more favorable product mix and better-than-expected pricing. Shares of Scotts Valley, California-based Seagate, down about 21 percent this year, fell 18 cents in extended trading following the earnings report after closing up 1 percent at $20.17 on the New York Stock Exchange. For its fiscal fourth quarter ending in June, Seagate forecast net income ranging from 37 cents per share to 41 cents per share and revenue of $2.85 billion to $3 billion. Analysts, on average, are expecting fourth-quarter net income of 53 cents per share and revenue of $3.11 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. They are forecasting earnings before items of 58 cents per share. Seagate on Tuesday forecast fourth-quarter earnings of 41 cents to 45 cents per share excluding certain costs. Seagate, whose main competitors include Western Digital Corp WDC.N and Japan's Hitachi Ltd ( 6501.T ), said last month it had sold more high-end equipment to corporate customers and benefited from better pricing for its products. Disk-drive prices fell sharply last year as Seagate's rivals sought to gain market share. (Reporting by  Philipp Gollner ; editing by Carol Bishopric, Phil Berlowitz)
