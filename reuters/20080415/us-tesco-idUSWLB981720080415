 LONDON  (Reuters) - Tesco Plc ( TSCO.L ), the world's third-biggest retailer, met forecasts with an 11 percent rise in annual profit on Tuesday and said it had made a strong start to its new financial year, sending its shares higher. 

 Britain's biggest supermarket group said it made a trading profit of 2.75 billion pounds ($5.4 billion) in the 52 weeks to February 23, led by strong growth in its international and online businesses. Tesco said sales were ahead of budget at its nascent U.S. operation "Fresh & Easy Neighborhood Market", and the company put a value on its property portfolio of 31 billion pounds -- a 57 percent premium to book value -- a figure taken as upbeat by the market given softening UK property prices. "Tesco have coming storming back after all the recent criticism, with strong vibes about trading both in the UK and the United States and their up-to-date property valuation," Pali International analyst Nick Bubb said in a note. Tesco shares were up as much as 4.5 percent at 408.3 pence in early trade, strongly outperforming the DJ Stoxx index of European retailers. Chief Executive Terry Leahy told Reuters the tough UK economy, with rising energy prices and mortgage repayments, meant consumer habits were changing but Tesco tended to "grow market share in this kind of environment". "It is not all gloom, there are opportunities," Leahy said in an interview. "Customers are more likely to look for value and value is one of the strengths for Tesco. We are a company for all seasons." Tesco has more than 30 percent of the market in Britain, double that of its nearest rivals Asda ( WMT.N ) and J. Sainsbury ( SBRY.L ). Like-for-like sales, excluding fuel, in Tesco's core UK market rose 3.5 percent, and were up over 4 percent in the first five weeks of its new financial year. This was slower than 4.1 percent growth in the third quarter, however. U.S. "AHEAD OF BUDGET" Sales from its international operations, in 12 countries spanning China to the Thailand, Turkey and the United States, the world's toughest consumer market, also grew strongly, rising 22.5 percent at constant exchange rates. In the United States, where it now has 60 stores after launching last November, sales were ahead of budget and sales densities were higher than the U.S. supermarket average with the best stores exceeding $20 per square foot, Tesco said. In Britain, competition is heating up between the big four food retailers -- Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury and Morrisons ( MRW.L ) -- for a share of dwindling households budgets squeezed by higher mortgage repayments and energy bills. Leahy said Tesco was responding to the toughening economic conditions by paying very close attention to its research into consumer loyalty and targeting consumers with better promotions. "We always want to keep the pressure up on price," he said. Tesco's figures were at odds with UK retail data released on Tuesday showing British like-for-like retail sales fell in March for the first time in two years and at the sharpest pace in nearly three years. The grim data gave rise to speculation that while Tesco was not suffering, general retailers such as Marks & Spencer ( MKS.L ), Next ( NXT.L ) and DSG International DSGI.L, are likely to be feeling the impact of crimped consumer spending. Tesco's sales from non-food -- spanning clothes to electrical goods and garden furniture -- slowed in the second half to 8 percent growth from 10 percent in the first half of the year. Clothing particularly slowed to growth of 6 percent. But it saw strong performance in online operations, with Tesco Direct sales increasing to 180 million pounds from virtually a standing start. Tesco.com saw a 31 percent increase in sales to 1.6 billion pounds. (Additional reporting by  Mark Potter ; Editing by Quentin Bryar)
