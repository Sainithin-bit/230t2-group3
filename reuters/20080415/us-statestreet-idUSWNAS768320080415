 BOSTON  (Reuters) - Financial services company State Street Corp ( STT.N ) said on Tuesday quarterly profit surged 69 percent as demand for its services grew and it benefited from the acquisition of a rival last summer. 

 State Street, one of the world's biggest institutional money managers, said net income totaled $530 million, or $1.35 per share, compared with $314 million, or 93 cents a share, a year earlier. The company, which also earns fees by holding trillions of dollars in securities in custody and calculating the bulk of mutual fund prices printed in newspapers, said the latest earnings include $17 million, or 4 cents a share, in after-tax merger and integration costs related to the acquisition of Boston-based Investors Finance Services Corp last July. The acquisition added $220 million to State Street's first-quarter revenue, helping boosted its total revenue to a record $2.6 billion. Wall Street analysts had expected State Street to earn $1.30 per share on revenue of $2.4 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. State Street's chairman and chief executive, Ron Logue, said, "We experienced growth in nearly all lines of our income statement and recorded positive operating leverage for the fourteenth consecutive quarter." He also sounded a slightly more optimistic note about the year's business, saying the company expects to deliver results in the middle of its stated ranges. In January he said the results would likely be at the lower end of the ranges. (Reporting by Svea Herbst-Bayliss; editing by John Wallace)
