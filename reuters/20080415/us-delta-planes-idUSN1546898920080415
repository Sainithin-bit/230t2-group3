 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Delta Air Lines Inc's ( DAL.N ) deal to buy rival Northwest Airlines Corp NWA.N won't mean canceling existing plane purchases, or shifting its fleet strategy, the chief executive of what will become the world's biggest airline said on Tuesday. 

 The combined carrier will have a fleet of nearly 800 large commercial aircraft on its mainline routes, if the deal goes ahead, making it one of the biggest customers for plane makers Boeing Co ( BA.N ) and EADS ( EAD.PA ) unit Airbus. The two airlines have about 80 planes on order for delivery over the next five years, Delta CEO Richard Anderson said at a press conference in New York on Tuesday. "The vast majority, if not all of those, have backstop financing," said Anderson, asked about the possible effect of the global credit crunch on plane purchases. "Airplanes are still very financable assets." Anderson said the combined airline, which he will lead, would only buy planes when it makes economic sense. He gave no hints as to whether it would lean toward Boeing or Airbus. "The combined airline will be the largest operator of (Airbus) A330s and the largest operator of (Boeing) 767s and 757s," said Anderson. "So you're basically going to have a very balanced fleet between Boeing and Airbus and we would expect that would be the case going forward." According to the plane makers' websites, Delta has 52 Boeing planes on order, comprising 46 single aisle 737s and six 777 minijumbos. Northwest has 18 of Boeing's new 787 Dreamliners on order and seven Airbus single-aisle planes. Airbus has been targeting Northwest as one of the few U.S. airlines that might be willing to buy its A380 superjumbo for use on its Asia routes, but the airline has so far not been tempted to order. The purchase of Northwest, worth about $3.2 billion in Delta stock, was announced late on Monday after more than three months of talks. (Reporting by  Bill Rigby ; editing by Gunna Dickson)
