 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Option traders may be betting on a recovery in the shares of B/E Aerospace Inc ( BEAV.O ) on hopes the world's biggest maker of plane seats will benefit from the latest proposed consolidation in the airline industry. 

 Delta Air Lines Inc ( DAL.N ) said on Monday night it planned to buy Northwest Airlines Corp NWA.N in a bid to create the world's largest airline by traffic. B/E Aerospace shares fell 44 cents to close at $34.01 in Nasdaq trading. Its stock has dropped 35.7 percent for the year to date. "Assuming the merger goes through, the corporate identity will be a big benefit to B/E Aerospace as they are the leader in commercial and private airline interiors," said Jon Najarian, a founder of Web information site optionmonster.com. Even though B/E Aerospace shares were down, Najarian notes that option buyers came in late in the day and began placing bullish bets for the May earnings and/or improved outlook as a result of the pending Delta/Northwest deal. B/E Aerospace would stand to benefit from the upgrade cycle as the carriers spend to improve their aging fleets, he added. The Wellington, Florida-based company is due to report quarterly earnings on April 28 after April options expire. FBR Capital Markets Corp reiterated in a research note its outperform rating and $55 price target on B/E Aerospace on Tuesday, saying airline consolidation has positive implications for the company in the long term. "A healthier airline industry bodes well for B/E Aerospace, and a reduction in capacity and an increase in pricing are a means for the airlines to increase spending on the aging fleet," FBR analysts said. In the options market, volume was heavily biased to the call side, as 6,229 contracts traded, compared with only 387 puts, nine times the normal level, according to option analytics firm Trade Alert. Directional sentiment for volume was 69 percent bullish, Trade Alert data showed. Fresh positioning was seen in the May $35 calls, enabling investors to buy B/E Aerospace shares at $35 a piece, as more than 3,700 contracts traded for $2 a contract. The same strike price in the July contract was also busy. "Options traders may have taken a contrarian stance following three consecutive days of share losses on hopes of a rebound," said Rebecca Engmann Darst, equity options analyst at Interactive Brokers Group in Greenwich, Connecticut. It may be premature to suppose that a thinning of the ranks in the proposed Delta/Northwest fleet would justify much more downside for B/E Aerospace share price, she said.
