 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Hedge fund managers should improve disclosures of hard-to-value assets and give investors public company-style performance reports to bolster market stability, two U.S. Treasury committees recommended on Tuesday. 

 The private-sector panels, in drafting best-practices guides, said hedge fund managers should set up independent committees for valuing assets and seek outside reviews when they base valuations of illiquid assets on models. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said the intent of the reports was to signal to markets that "heightened vigilance" was necessary and that they need to tighten up their practices so as not to endanger the financial system. With nearly $2 trillion invested in some 8,000 hedge funds, concerns over their holdings of largely illiquid, complex securities backed by mortgages has added to market uncertainty and turmoil. The Asset Managers' Committee said hedge fund managers should adopt the key principles of U.S. public company disclosure standards, including quarterly and annual reports, timely disclosures of material events and audited financial statements compliant with accounting standards. The panel's report said hedge funds should adopt soon-to-be-implemented accounting standards that call for financial institutions to categorize assets into three levels based on how difficult they are to value. "This report calls on hedge funds to implement these rules and go beyond them by disclosing, on a quarterly basis, the portion of their assets and the performance attributable to each of the three levels," said Asset Managers' Committee Chairman Eric Mindich, chief executive of Eton Park Capital Management. "This will go a long way to help clarify the types of assets and risks in the fund." But adoption of the best practices is voluntary, and the Treasury will collect industry comments on them for 60 days. A Treasury-led market regulators' group ordered the guidelines last year in lieu of proposing new rules for the sector. The voluntary nature of the guidelines drew a sharp rebuke from Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal, who said they must be mandatory. "Non-binding best practices or voluntary guidelines are an imaginary fence -- and virtual farce. They stop nothing," said Blumenthal, an advocate of tougher rules whose state is home to nearly one-third of hedge funds. "These measures leave hedge funds in a regulatory black hole," he added. Treasury Assistant Secretary Anthony Ryan told a news conference that hedge funds will be closely watched to see whether they are doing a better job in disclosing risks. "We're going to continue to monitor best practices, see how behavior changes," Ryan said, when asked whether there was any provision for regulators to force compliance if funds did not do so voluntarily. Mindich said the 10 hedge funds represented on the panel would adopt the guidelines, which would encourage more industry participation. STOMACH FOR VOLATILITY A second panel, the Investors' Committee, recommended that pension funds, endowment funds and other investment fiduciaries should have written procedures to determine whether hedge fund investments are appropriate for them. The panel said one question that prudential funds should ask themselves was: "Do we have the institutional fortitude to stick with our strategic allocation in the face of short-term volatility?" Panel Chairman Russell Read, chief investment officer for the influential California Public Employees Retirement System, said the intent behind the proposals was not necessarily to compel highly competitive hedge funds to provide "complete disclosure" of their activities but to offer "adequate disclosure" so that pension funds and other fiduciaries can assess whether they are an appropriate investment vehicle. The recommendations were greeted with guarded praise by hedge fund trade groups. Jim Chanos, chairman of the Coalition of Private Investment Companies, said they "contain robust recommendations that will take a step toward improving confidence at a time when that has become the scarcest commodity of all." In a joint statement, the Alternative Investment Management Association and the Managed Funds Association called the guidance "comprehensive and substantive" and said they looked forward to submitting formal comments.
