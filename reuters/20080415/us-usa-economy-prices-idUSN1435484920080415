 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Producer prices advanced by a more-than-expected 1.1 percent in March after energy costs jumped, Labor Department data on Tuesday showed, but core inflation at the producer level was more subdued. 

 Economists polled by Reuters had forecast that producer prices -- a gauge of costs at the farm and factory gate -- would rise 0.6 percent last month from a 0.3 percent gain in February. Core producer prices, which strip out volatile food and energy costs, increased 0.2 percent as forecast. Finished energy goods were up 2.9 percent while food goods increased 1.2 percent. On a year-on-year basis, producer prices were up 6.9 percent while core 12-month PPI increased by 2.7 percent -- the largest rise since July 2005.
