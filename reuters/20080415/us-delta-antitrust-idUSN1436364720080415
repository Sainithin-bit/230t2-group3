 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Delta Air Lines' proposed takeover of Northwest Airlines is the biggest airline test yet for U.S. antitrust officials, but experts do not expect a drawn-out review or any significant roadblocks to the deal. 

 While the U.S. Justice Department is expected to work carefully, the agency's track record on consolidation favors approval. "This administration has taken a very pro-merger stance," said Diana Moss, an economist and senior fellow at the nonprofit American Antitrust Institute.

That is good for merger proponents who believe their best chance rests with the Bush administration, which leaves in January. "I think the review can be completed in time," said Andrew Steinberg, who most recently was a senior aviation policy official at the U.S. Transportation Department, which would have a say in the decision. "A lot depends on things that vary from case to case. So it depends on the parties' ability to produce relevant documents as well as their (willingness) to fix any perceived competitive issues," Steinberg said. Divestment of some airport gates to competitors would likely be a condition of approval, experts agreed. Ted Bolema, a former Justice Department antitrust official in the Clinton administration and now a merger expert at Central Michigan University, said market concentration generally dominates antitrust review rather than politics or industry financial turmoil, not including bankruptcies. "This administration is more likely to look more strictly at market factors," Bolema said. CONCENTRATION KEY While the scope of this deal is unprecedented -- nearly 20 percent domestic market share based on passenger revenue -- Northwest and Delta have few overlapping routes, a crucial factor. If approved, the new carrier would leave six major airlines, including low-cost power Southwest Airlines, competing for U.S. market share. Delta commands 53 percent of business at its Atlanta hub and a third of flights at Salt Lake City and Cincinnati. Northwest has 66 percent of the business at Minneapolis, 60 percent at Detroit and half the flights at Memphis. They have few overlaps with nonstop service, including New York's John F. Kennedy airport to Detroit; Cincinnati to Detroit; Cincinnati to Minneapolis and Salt Lake City to Minneapolis, according to fare expert Terry Trippler. There are no overlapping routes in their top 10 markets respectively, but the Atlanta/Memphis proximity could raise eyebrows at Justice. While competition concerns derailed a proposed 2001 merger between US Airways and United, the Bush administration has cleared other deals where there were few overlaps. "It all lays out in favor of working for Northwest and Delta," Trippler said. The Justice Department this year approved the buyout of Midwest Air Group, parent of Midwest Airlines, by private equity firm TPG Capital LIMITED POLITICS The potential for political or industry blowback is also limited for now. Legal and regulatory experts see no partisan issues to overcome, though some in Congress, which can pressure antitrust enforcers but not block a merger, oppose consolidation or have expressed concern with this deal on grounds it could hurt workers and consumers. U.S. Sen. Herb Kohl, a Wisconsin Democrat and chairman of the antitrust judiciary subcommittee, is concerned about the impact on small and mid-sized markets. "While we understand the financial pressures under which the major airlines have been operating, it is nonetheless also vital that this deal does not lead to fare increases and service reductions," Kohl said. Although air mergers have a rocky history, there is a sense of inevitability about consolidation now. Carriers see it as a way to counter the financial wrecking ball of skyrocketing fuel costs and the weakening U.S. economy, as well as stem share price declines and address the overseas competitive threat. "Consolidation is still foremost on the minds of most investors and airline management," analyst Ray Neidl of Calyon Securities said in a recent note. Low cost carriers, sensing their surge in the domestic marketplace as well as a rare near-term opportunity to gain more business travelers, hope the government will force merged airlines to divest gates and slots at busy airports to spur more competition. Delta and Northwest have said they plan to grow the airline to new markets, which they say will benefit consumers. Healthy domestic competition driven by low cost carriers is a central point in their argument for antitrust approval. (Editing by  Ian Geoghegan )
