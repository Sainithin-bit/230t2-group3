 LONDON  (Reuters) - U.S.-based private equity firm Blackstone Group ( BX.N ) appears to have killed three birds with one stone by selling a nearly 10 percent stake to China for $3 billion in May. 

 Not only did it find a wealthy new investor and position itself for deals in the world's most populous nation, but also the deal raised the profile of its M&A advisory business by leading to a highly visible role of advising the Chinese government on the acquisition of a stake in Barclays ( BARC.L ). In doing so, Blackstone links its name to what is likely to be the year's biggest deal -- the sale of Dutch bank ABN AMRO AAH.AS. Barclays has used the investment from China to help increase its bid to 67.5 billion euros ($93.26 billion) in a battle with a rival group led by the Royal Bank of Scotland ( RBS.L ). Blackstone's presence in China and its links with the government look set to give it a slice of M&A advisory business in a country flush with $1.33 trillion in foreign exchange reserves, and which has made no secret of its plans to diversify its portfolio of foreign holdings. "Blackstone now, in a short period of time, can present itself as having a credible global network," said John Studzinski, head of its corporate and mergers and acquisitions advisory group. "We think we add value (as an adviser) on any international transaction." The Barclays deal has helped propel Blackstone to number five in the M&A advisory league tables for China so far this year, according to data consultancy Dealogic. Studzinski's former bank, HSBC ( HSBA.L ), is ninth. The mandate also comes as private equity firms try to branch out of leveraged buyouts amid fears the lending environment that fuelled the boom in the past few years may be about to cool. Blackstone's shares, for example, have fallen by about a quarter since its listing last month. Studzinski joined in 2006 after three years at HSBC. He had previously spent 23 years at Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ), culminating with a spell as head of the New York-based investment bank's European investment banking unit. Blackstone's advisory business employed 164 people across the United States and in London as of May 1. The private equity firm also opened an office for its buyout unit in Hong Kong in January and hired a new senior managing director and chairman for greater China. BARCLAYS AND CHINA Barclays too is hoping to get a boost from the deal on Monday for China Development Bank to invest in the British bank. CDB says it will not team up with any other major overseas bank, and Barclays says the deal will give it unprecedented access to Chinese clients. The deal could help the two banks boost revenues in areas including asset management, commodities, risk management, payments systems and trade finance, and by developing trade between Asia and Africa. "I think it will be regarded as a very significant event in global markets. It's by far the biggest external investment ever made by China," Barclays Chief Executive John Varley said. But he said it was a two-way deal. "What's happening is CDB's client base is getting increasingly active internationally, so for CDB to serve those clients it needs to increase its capabilities, and it can see how we are able to help with that," Varley said. Under the deal, China Development Bank, which is being advised by Blackstone, will take a 3.1 percent stake in Barclays, which could rise to 8 percent if the UK bank is successful in its pursuit of ABN. The full 8 percent investment would be China's biggest overseas investment. CDB is one of the country's three lenders driven by a strategy to support government policy. "The most interesting thing is that the China Development Bank made the decision to do this in a very short time," said Studzinski. "Which tells you that when presented with strategic opportunities, the Chinese can be very disciplined, yet nimble and quick at decision-making." Blackstone is also advising Reuters Group Plc RTR.L in its acquisition by Canada's Thomson Corp TOC.TO. For main story on Barclays bid for ABN with support of CDB, click on <ID:nL23714693>.
