 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A hedge fund manager who was among more than a dozen people accused of participating in an insider trading ring on Wall Street pleaded guilty on Tuesday to profiting from inside tips allegedly leaked by a former UBS Securities ( UBSN.VX ) executive. 

 Mark Lenowitz, who had worked as a stock picker for hedge funds Chelsey Capital and Q Capital Investment Partners, admitted in U.S. District Court in New York to trading on nonpublic information he received about upcoming upgrades and downgrades by UBS stock analysts. Lenowitz pleaded guilty to one charge of conspiracy and one charge of securities fraud at a hearing before U.S. District Judge Sidney Stein. He faces a maximum prison sentence of 20 years on the most serious charge when he is sentenced on January 18.
