 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Netflix Inc. ( NFLX.O ), the largest 
online DVD rental company, on Monday reported its first-ever 
quarterly drop in subscriptions and cut forecasts for 
subscribers, revenue and profit for the year in the face of 
fierce competition from Blockbuster Inc. BBI.N 

  Shares fell 4 percent in extended trading. The stock had 
already closed the regular trading session 12 percent lower 
after the company cut prices on two of its subscription plans.  Chief Financial Officer Barry McCarthy told analysts on a 
conference call that Wall Street estimates for fiscal 2008 
earnings growth were "excessively optimistic."  "When Blockbuster decides to operate its online business 
profitably, our financial results will improve also, but until 
that time both subscriber growth and earnings will remain under 
pressure," McCarthy said.  Netflix has spent the last six months fending off a rising 
challenge from Blockbuster, which said it will spend $170 
million this year to promote its Total Access plan. That allows 
subscribers to swap DVDs rented online at its stores for free 
and has become a powerful competitor to Netflix.  On Sunday, Netflix cut prices for two of its most popular 
monthly rental plans by $1 each, to $16.99 and $8.99, to bring 
them in line with Blockbuster's online-only rental plan. It 
previously had cut two other plans by $1 each.  The Los Gatos, California-based company, which pioneered 
online DVD rentals and controls two-thirds of the market, said 
its net subscriber base dropped to 6.74 million from 6.8 
million in the first quarter.  Despite the raft of bad news, Netflix beat Street profit 
projections by a wide margin, and Chief Executive Officer Reed 
Hastings said the company expects to sign up more subscribers 
in the back half of the year "even if there is no change in 
competitive landscape."  Hastings said the downward revisions of Netflix's forecasts 
reflected a worst-case scenario that Blockbuster would continue 
to run its online business at a loss.
  WAITING IT OUT  "They are responding in ways that make sense, ways that 
arguably are the best way to try and protect shareholder value, 
but that doesn't mean shareholder value will go up," said JP 
Morgan analyst Barton Crockett, who has an "underweight" rating 
on Netflix.  Net income for the second quarter was $25.6 million, or 37 
cents per share, compared with $17 million, or 25 cents per 
share, a year earlier, boosted in part by a $4.1 million 
settlement of a patent dispute.  Excluding some items, Netflix earned 31 cents per share, 
compared with the Wall Street target of 25 cents per share, 
according to Reuters Estimates.  Revenue rose 27 percent to $303.7 million, from $239.4 
million in last year's second quarter but finished behind 
analysts' average expectation of $307.8 million.  Wedbush Morgan Michael Pachter, who has a "sell" rating on 
Netflix, said the company appeared to have cut marketing 
spending.  "If they don't spend money on marketing they are delusional 
if they think it's going to attract millions of subscribers," 
Pachter said.  Netflix now expects to end the year with 6.8 million to 7.3 
million subscribers, down from a previous forecast of 7.3 
million to 7.8 million. It dropped its revenue expectation to 
between $1.17 billion to $1.19 billion from $1.21 billion to 
$1.26 billion, and reduced its net income outlook to 62 cents 
to 76 cents per share from 76 cents to 83 cents per share.  Shares of Netflix fell to $16.60 in extended trading after 
closing down $2.36, or 12 percent, at $17.27 in regular trading 
Monday on Nasdaq.
