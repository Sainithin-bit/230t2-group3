 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - CME Group Inc. CME.N reported higher second-quarter profit on Tuesday as the company focused on completing a merger between the two largest U.S. futures exchanges. 

 CME Group was created by the purchase of the Chicago Board of Trade's parent by Chicago Mercantile Exchange Holdings. The deal closed earlier this month. Net income for CME Holdings rose to $126 million, or $3.57 per share, from $109.5 million, or $3.12 a share, a year earlier. Excluding expenses from the merger, earnings were up 18 percent at $3.69 per share. Analysts on average had expected $3.66 before special items, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue increased 17 percent to $329 million, just shy of forecasts of $330.51 million. Derivatives trading picked up in May and June after a quiet April to show a 10 percent rise for the quarter. "Both CME and CBOT racked up strong results based on what appears to be an almost insatiable demand for the trading of derivatives," said Octavio Marenzi, chief executive of Boston-based financial research and consulting firm Celent. CME is pushing ahead with its promised "cost synergies," highlighted by layoffs likely to number in the hundreds. It said on Tuesday that it expected to complete staffing plans in mid-August. The company also said it planned to move CBOT's electronic derivatives trading to the Globex electronic platform by the end of January. It previously said it would do this in first quarter 2008. The transition of open-outcry trading for all products to CBOT's trading floors should start in March, also earlier than planned, and take place in three stages between March and May. CME's rate per contract, a key measure of operating margins, fell to 62.4 cents from 64.4 cents in the first quarter. The drop reflected a shift in trading mix that favored members over nonmembers, as well as heavy floor trading of Eurodollar options, CME Group Chief Financial Officer Jamie Parisi told analysts on a conference call. CBOT BOWS OUT WITH STRONG QUARTER Separately, CME said second-quarter net income at CBOT Holdings -- the final quarter as a standalone entity for the 159-year old Board of Trade -- was $58 million or $1.10 per share, up from $43 million, or 82 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding $20 million in merger-related costs, earnings would have been $1.35 per share, up 65 percent. That bested the last consensus estimate of $1.28 per share before CBOT shares were delisted on July 12. Revenue rose 33 percent to $204 million. That reflected strong trading volume and a higher rate per contract, at 66.2 cents, compared with 63.3 cents in the first quarter and 56.4 cents a year earlier. Margins got a boost from an unusually high level of exchange-for-physical transactions tied to plays on the shape of the U.S. Treasury yield curve, Parisi said. In morning New York Stock Exchange trade, CME shares were down $2.05, or 0.4 percent, at $557.55. (Reporting by Ros Krasny)
