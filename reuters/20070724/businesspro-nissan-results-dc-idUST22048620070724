 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co. ( 7201.T ), Japan's 
third-largest automaker, posted a 3.2 percent drop in quarterly 
operating profit as a worsening product mix favoring smaller, 
cheaper cars hit margins, and kept its full-year forecasts 
unchanged despite the weaker yen. 

  Carlos Ghosn, chief executive of both Nissan and 
controlling shareholder Renault SA ( RENA.PA ), warned investors 
last month that first-quarter results would soften due to an 
industry-wide decline in sales of SUVs and other light trucks 
in the United States, its most profitable market.  Nissan's U.S. sales of light trucks, including the Titan 
pickup and Pathfinder SUV, skidded 12 percent in the first half 
of 2007 as high pump prices hurt demand for gas-guzzlers. 
Passenger car sales, meanwhile, rose an adjusted 17 percent 
thanks partly to the addition of the Versa subcompact.  Still, Nissan is expected to be alone among Japan's top 
automakers to report a quarterly drop in operating profit. 
Rivals Toyota Motor Corp. ( 7203.T ) and Honda Motor Co. ( 7267.T ) 
are expected to weather pricier commodity costs and 
intensifying price wars with the weaker yen, cost cuts and 
brisk overseas sales.  In the April-June first quarter, Nissan made an operating 
profit of 148.44 billion yen ($1.23 billion), lagging a 
consensus estimate of 152.6 billion yen in a survey of six 
brokerages by Reuters.  Net profit sank 16 percent to 92.31 billion yen due to 
difficult comparisons from the year earlier when it had an 
exceptionally low tax rate. Revenue rose 11 percent to 2.446 
trillion yen.  Operating profit would have suffered a bigger fall without 
a hefty one-off warranty charge a year earlier for engine 
troubles in North America.  For the business year to March 31, 2008, Nissan kept its 
operating profit forecast at 800 billion yen and net forecast 
at 480 billion yen. It left its dollar  JPY=  and euro 
EURJPY= exchange rate assumptions at 117 yen and 148 yen, 
respectively.  The dollar is trading at 120.6 yen and the euro at 166.6 
yen.  Shares in Nissan, which was first to report quarterly 
results among Japanese automakers, gained 4.6 percent to 1,321 
yen during the three months to June 30, compared with a 5.8 
percent rise in Tokyo's transport sector subindex .ITEQP.T.  Nissan ended up 0.5 percent at 1,311 yen before the results 
on Tuesday.
