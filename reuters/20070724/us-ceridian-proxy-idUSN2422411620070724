 BOSTON  (Reuters) - Hedge fund Pershing Square stepped up its battle with payroll processing company Ceridian ( CEN.N ) on Tuesday by saying it will soon ask shareholders to vote against a planned takeover bid and to fire the board. 

 In an unusual step, Pershing Square said it plans to replace all seven Ceridian board members at the annual meeting scheduled for September 12. Activist hedge fund investors typically try to win one or two board seats to gain influence. Pershing Square, Ceridian's largest stakeholder with 14.9 percent, said management is ready to sell itself too cheaply for $36 a share to buyout company Thomas H. Lee THL.UL and Fidelity National Financial Inc. ( FNF.N ) because that deal will reward executives and board members with a $27 million payout. Ceridian's share price has declined since the takeover deal was announced earlier this summer and closed trading Tuesday down 1.5 percent at $33.79 on the New York Stock Exchange. Pershing Square has not said what the company should be valued at, but it is unusual for a hedge fund to turn its back on an all cash deal that would yield a considerable payout. Pershing Square manager William Ackman was not available for comment. The New York-based hedge fund, which became prominent when it prodded hamburger chain Wendy's WEN.N into selling its Tim Hortons coffee shop chain and prompted changes at McDonald's Corp. ( MCD.N ), has said it is working with Lazard Freres & Co and has been in touch with potential buyers it declined to name. Ceridian has rebuffed Pershing Square, saying the hedge fund's proposal is not detailed enough to warrant a closer look. Pershing Square, which prides itself on working with most companies and has never mounted a proxy fight before, now plans to use a shareholder's most powerful tool for pushing change. It will mail proxy cards to shareholders like asset manager Janus Capital Management and hedge funds Tudor Investment Corp. and Och Ziff as soon as financial regulators have reviewed the documents filed on Tuesday. Pershing Square said Ceridian's entire board should be replaced because it failed to boost shareholder value by spinning off the Comdata division and neglecting the HRS division and had mismanaged the company's senior ranks. The hedge fund said the board overpaid managers who underperformed, noting that a former chief executive officer earned $10 million last year. It also said White Matthews, the chairman of Ceridian's board, used the company plane seven times in a 63-day period to fly to his Wyoming vacation home. Ceridian spokesman Pete Stoddart said the plane was used for business purposes only and declined further comment.
