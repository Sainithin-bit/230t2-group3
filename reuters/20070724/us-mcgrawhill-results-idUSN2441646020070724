 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - McGraw-Hill Cos Inc MHP.N said on Tuesday its quarterly profit rose 25.4 percent, driven by good results at its Standard & Poor's unit. 

 McGraw-Hill, which also owns BusinessWeek magazine, said second-quarter net income was $277.08 million, or 79 cents a share, compared with $220.96 million, or 60 cents a share, in the second quarter last year. Revenue rose 12.5 percent to $1.7 billion. "A very strong performance by financial services was a key factor in our second quarter," Chief Executive Harold McGraw III said in a statement. Financial services revenue rose 21.2 percent to $821 million, compared with last year, while operating profit rose 27.9 percent. McGraw also said its education group performed well in large urban markets such as the science programs in New York City and Washington, D.C., math in Boston and New York City and music in St. Louis and Prince George's County, Maryland. McGraw-Hill said the education group expects to gain share in an elementary- to high-school market that will grow 5 percent to 7 percent in 2007. (Reporting by  Robert MacMillan )
