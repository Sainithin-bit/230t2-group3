 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Property and casualty insurer Chubb Corp ( CB.N ) said on Tuesday earnings rose in the second quarter, helped by lower payouts, and it raised its full-year guidance. 

 Net earnings were $709 million, or $1.75 per share, up from $598 million, or $1.41 per share, in the year-earlier quarter. Chubb, based in Warren, New Jersey, said operating earnings, which analysts use to measure performance because it excludes investments, rose to $648 million, or $1.60 per share. Analysts on average had expected the high-end property insurer to earn $1.39 a share, according to Reuters Estimates. In the year-ago quarter, Chubb had operating income of $571 million, or $1.35 per share. Chubb, which celebrated its 125th anniversary this year, raised its guidance for operating earnings for the full year to a range of $5.70 to $6.10 per share from its previous guidance of $5.00 to $5.40. "It was a 'top-line, bottom line' story," said Donald Light, an analyst with Celent LLC. "They had a very good quarter, earnings-wise, but revenue growth remains sluggish." While earnings rose, total net written premiums for the quarter declined 1 percent to $3.1 billion. However, payouts and expenses also dropped. The company's "combined ratio," a measure of premiums earned against payouts and expenses, improved by 2.5 percentage points to 82.7 percent, a record for the company, Chief Executive John Finnegan said in a statement. Property and casualty investment income increased 9 percent to $313 million. But some areas showed softness. Chubb's professional liability unit recorded a 1 percent decline in premiums, reflecting fierce competition to insure executives and boards. Commercial insurance renewal rates dropped 3 percent. Chubb shares closed down 2.34 percent $49.63 in regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange before rising slightly to $51.00 in after-hours trading. The stock is little changed from a year ago. In the same period, the Standard & Poor's insurance index .GSPINSC has risen about 13 percent. (Reporting by Ed Leefeldt)
