 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A hedge fund manager who was among more than a dozen people accused of participating in an insider trading ring on Wall Street pleaded guilty on Tuesday to profiting from inside tips allegedly leaked by a former UBS Securities ( UBSN.VX ) executive. 

 Mark Lenowitz, who had worked as a stock picker for hedge funds Chelsey Capital and Q Capital Investment Partners, admitted in U.S. District Court in New York to trading on nonpublic information he received about upcoming upgrades and downgrades by UBS stock analysts. Lenowitz pleaded guilty to one charge of conspiracy and one charge of securities fraud at a hearing before U.S. District Judge Sidney Stein. He faces a maximum prison sentence of 20 years when he is scheduled to be sentenced on January 18. "I understood my conduct was wrong," he said, and agreed to forfeit more than $337,000 as part of the plea deal. U.S. prosecutors filed criminal charges against 13 people, including Lenowitz, in March in what authorities said was one of the most pervasive insider-trading rings since the 1980s. Those charged in the case netted about $8 million in illicit profit, the government said. At the time, Manhattan U.S. Attorney Michael Garcia said part of the scheme involved ex-UBS executive Mitchel Guttenberg, who is accused of selling information about upcoming changes to analyst ratings to traders. Prosecutors said that Lenowitz obtained the ratings tips from Erik Franklin, a hedge fund colleague who bought the inside information from Guttenberg. Among the stocks he profited on was Tenet Healthcare Corp ( THC.N ). and Marsh & McLennan Cos Inc. ( MMC.N ), prosecutors said. Six other defendants, including Franklin have entered guilty pleas. Prosecutors said Lenowitz used the tips to buy and sell stocks for the accounts of Chelsey Capital and Q Capital. He would buy shares of companies that were about to be upgraded, then sell them for a profit after UBS publicly announced a revised rating, prosecutors said. When UBS was about to issue a downgrade, he would short the stock, according to the indictment. Lenowitz worked at Chelsey from 2001 to 2002. He later became a partner at Q Capital and worked there until about March 2005, the prosecutors said. (Reporting by  Christine Kearney  and  Martha Graybow )
