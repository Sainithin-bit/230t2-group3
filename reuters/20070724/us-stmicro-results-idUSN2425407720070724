 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - STMicroelectronics NV ( STM.PA )( STM.N ) reported a quarterly loss compared with a year ago profit on Tuesday, citing about $906 million in impairment and restructuring charges. 

 The Franco-Italian chip maker reported a second-quarter net loss of $758 million, or 84 cents per share, compared with a year-earlier profit of $168 million, or 18 cents per diluted share. Revenue fell to $2.41 billion from $2.49 billion. STMicroelectronics also on Tuesday said it teamed up with IBM ( IBM.N ) to develop semiconductor manufacturing technology. Excluding the $906 million in charges, the company reported adjusted second quarter income of $139 million or 15 cents per share. Analysts had expected a net profit of 15 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue, on average, was expected to dip 1.4 percent to $2.46 billion in the latest quarter, according to Reuters Estimates. Forecasts ranged between $2.41 billion and $2.67 billion. For most of this decade, the company has been trying to improve margins by opening new plants in Asia while maintaining investment in new products to help it retain market share. STMicro's gross margin -- a closely watched figure by investors -- reached 34.7 percent during the second quarter, compared with 35.4 percent in the year ago quarter. The company had forecast second-quarter revenues would rise sequentially between 4 percent and 10 percent and gross margin would remain in a range of 34 percent to 36 percent. STMicro announced earlier this month that it would shut two U.S. silicon wafer manufacturing plants and halt packaging and testing at a plant in Morocco. The company also recently hived off its flash memory business into a joint-venture with Intel Corp ( INTC.O ) as part of efforts to curtail capital spending. The agreement with IBM will include work on higher density and higher performance processors. Each company will set up a team at a facility belonging to the other. STMicro expects sequential sales growth continuing in the range of 2 percent to 7 percent in the third quarter and it expects the gross margin to expand to about 35.5 percent plus or minus one percentage point.
