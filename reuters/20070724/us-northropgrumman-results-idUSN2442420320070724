 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Northrop Grumman Corp. ( NOC.N ) said on Tuesday second-quarter profit rose a greater-than-expected 7 percent, helped by higher information technology sales and an insurance gain at its storm-hit shipbuilding unit. 

 The No. 3 Pentagon supplier also raised the lower end of its full-year profit forecast as it projected higher sales overall and better margins. Northrop, behind only Lockheed Martin Corp. ( LMT.N ) and Boeing Co. ( BA.N ) in U.S. defense sales, reported quarterly profit of $460 million, or $1.31 per share, compared with $430 million, or $1.23 per share, in the year-ago quarter. Revenue rose 4 percent to $7.9 billion. Results beat Wall Street's earnings forecast of $1.23 per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue was slightly short of analysts' average estimate of $8 billion. Profit for the quarter was helped by a $62 million pre-tax insurance payout to compensate for profits lost after its Gulf Coast shipyards were devastated by Hurricane Katrina two years ago. For the full year, Northrop raised the bottom end of its earnings forecast to $4.90 a share, up from its previous forecast of $4.80. It left the upper end of the forecast at $5.05 per share. Analysts are forecasting $4.99 per share, on average. (Reporting by  Bill Rigby )
