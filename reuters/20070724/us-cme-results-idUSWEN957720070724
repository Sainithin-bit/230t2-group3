 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - CME Group Inc. CME.N said on Tuesday that quarterly profit rose as the company focused on completing a merger between the two largest U.S. futures exchanges. 

 CME Group was formed by the purchase of the Chicago Board of Trade's parent by Chicago Mercantile Exchange Holdings, which closed earlier this month. Second-quarter net income for CME Holdings was $126 million or $3.57 per share against $109.5 million or $3.12 a year ago. Excluding expenses related to the merger, second-quarter earnings was $3.69 per share, up 18 percent. Analysts on average had expected net income of $3.66 per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenues were $329 million, up 17 percent from $282 million a year earlier but just shy of forecasts of $330.51 million. "We focused intensely on integration planning and new growth initiatives over the last few months," CME Group chief executive Craig Donohue said in a press release. Separately, CME said second-quarter net income at CBOT Holdings was $58 million or $1.10 per share, up from $43 million or 82 cents a year ago. Excluding $20 million in merger-related costs earnings would have been $1.35 per share, up 65 percent. CBOT revenue was $204 million, up 33 percent from $154 million a year earlier. CME results for the third quarter will include CBOT results from July 13 onward.
