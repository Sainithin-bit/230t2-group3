 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Stock futures pointed to a mixed start on Wall Street on Tuesday, with investors set to eye a flood of quarterly earnings updates. 

 By 1000 GMT, September S&P 500 futures and Dow Jones futures were virtually unchanged while Nasdaq 100 futures were 0.12 percent lower. The Indicative Dow Jones industrial average, which tracks the 30 index blue chips as they are traded on the Deutsche Boerse's electronic trading platform, XETRA, and translates the prices into dollars, was 0.19 percent lower. Earnings reports are due from companies including online retailer Amazon.com Inc. ( AMZN.O ), drugmaker Eli Lilly & Co. ( LLY.N ) and hamburger chain McDonald's Corp. ( MCD.N ). So far the quarter's earnings results have presented a mixed picture. "We've seen relatively good figures from the pharmaceutical sector but weak updates from others such as Texas Instruments," said Alexander Burger from German regional bank LBBW. Shares in Merck & Co. ( MRK.N ) rose on Monday after the drugmaker posted results that beat analysts' expectations, while Texas Instruments Inc. TXN.N slipped after it issued a third-quarter revenue outlook range with a midpoint that was below analysts' forecasts. "What has surprised so far are financials. Those that have reported were not so bad as feared, and so far the subprime crisis does not seem to have had such a strong effect as expected," said Burger. "The problem at the moment is that the market is waiting for more bad news to use as a reason for profit-taking now that we have reached these highs." Merger activity continues to underpin the market. On Monday, Transocean Inc. ( RIG.N ), the world's largest offshore driller, said it had agreed to buy drilling rig operator GlobalSantaFe Corp. ( GSF.N ) for $18 billion. The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 0.67 percent on Monday, at 13,943.42. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index ended up 0.49 percent at 1,541.57, while the Nasdaq Composite Index was up 0.11 percent at 2,690.58. The economic agenda is relatively thin on Tuesday with no major indicators due.
