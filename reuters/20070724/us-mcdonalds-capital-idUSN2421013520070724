 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - McDonald's Corp. ( MCD.N ) Chief Executive Jim Skinner on Tuesday said the company was reviewing its capital structure and would discuss alternatives with its board of directors. 

 "We're not wedded to our capital structure right at the moment," Skinner said on a conference call with analysts. "We're taking a close look at it." He added that any decision about changes to the capital structure would likely be made this fall. (Reporting by  Nichola Groom )
