 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Centex Corp. ( CTX.N ), the fourth-largest U.S. home builder, posted a fiscal first-quarter loss on Tuesday, as the U.S. housing market continued to decline. 

 For the quarter ended June 30, the company posted a net loss of $128.0 million, or $1.05 per share, versus a profit of  $160.3 million, or $1.27 per share. Centex posted a loss from continuing operations of $131 million, or $1.08 a share, compared with a profit of $172 million, or $1.37 per share, in the year-earlier quarter. The results included a $193 million, or 98 cents per share, pretax charge related to the declining value of building lots. First-quarter home-building sales fell 32 percent to $1.8 billion, as home sales declined 27 percent to 6,095. The average selling price of a home fell 5.5 percent to $291,179. Financial services revenue was off 20 percent to $98 million and total revenue was down 31 percent to $1.94 billion. Incentives and lower home prices helped sink gross margins to 8.1 percent from 25.6 percent a year earlier. New orders, which are not a factor in this quarter's earnings, fell 22 percent during the quarter to 6,474, with the Southeast and Central regions showing the greatest decline, Dallas-based Centex said. U.S. home builders have been struggling with a glut of homes on the market, lower prices and stalled demand. Many executives have called 2007 a washout and did not expect to see the market stabilize until well into 2008. During the day, the Dow Jones U.S. Home Construction Index .DJUSHB, a yardstick that measures home builder performance, reached its lowest since October 2003. Centex shares closed down nearly 4 percent, or $1.43 to $39.04 on Tuesday and the Dow Jones U.S. Home Construction Index .DJUSHB, fell 1.62 percent.
