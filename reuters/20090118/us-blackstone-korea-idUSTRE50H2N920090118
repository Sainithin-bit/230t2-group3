 SEOUL  (Reuters) - Private equity firm Blackstone Group ( BX.N ) will launch a unit in South Korea this month to buy companies and real estate assets for a combined $2 billion, the Maeil Business Newspaper reported on Monday. 

 The daily cited finance and economy ministries and the National Pension Service (NPS) as saying that Blackstone had finished paper work and was fine-tuning the timing of the launch. In October, South Korea's state-run pension fund NPS said it had signed a preliminary agreement with Blackstone to invest $2 billion each in South Korea.
