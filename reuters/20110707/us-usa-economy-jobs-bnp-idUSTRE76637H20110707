 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - BNP Paribas said on Thursday it was raising its forecast for U.S. nonfarm payroll growth in June to 125,000 from 75,000 in light of an unexpectedly strong report on private hiring from payrolls processor ADP. 

 "We are revising our total nonfarm payroll forecast for tomorrow to 125K from 75K with 150K in private hiring up from 100K. We continue to look for layoffs of 25K in the public sector," Julia Coronado, chief North America economist at BNP Paribas in New York, said in a research note. BNP Paribas said it still expected the government's employment report on Friday to show the unemployment rate held steady at 9.1 percent last month. The report from ADP on Thursday showed private-sector employment rose 157,000 in June. Economists polled by Reuters had expected an increase of only 68,000.
