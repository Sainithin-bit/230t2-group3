 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - President Barack Obama and House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner have discussed a broader deficit reduction deal that would include an overhaul of the tax code and changes to Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, a Republican aide said on Thursday. 

 The aide said Boehner has not offered to increase income tax rates by letting Bush era tax cuts expire. (Reporting by  Andy Sullivan ; Editing by  Vicki Allen )
