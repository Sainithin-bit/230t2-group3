 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Countries already being bailed out by the IMF and neighboring countries should not immediately seek to involve private bondholders in taking losses, European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet said on Thursday. 

 Asked to elaborate on the ECB's resistance to efforts by European Union politicians and officials to share the cost of Greece's bailout with private bondholders, Trichet said it did not fit with global conventions. "The presumption in the international community is that if you have a particular country problem, you do what you can to have a very strong conditionality, which is indeed a global doctrine, of course, negotiated by the IMF," he said, emphasizing instead the need for governments to cut spending and improve national competitiveness. "And then you are financing the adjustment with a view to going back to normal creditworthiness and normal market financing as soon as possible," Trichet told a news conference after the ECB raised interest rates for the second time this year, despite the euro zone's debt crisis. "What is ... not at all in the global doctrine, is the idea that you are asking as soon as, on top of the IMF loan, there is a loan ... supplied by a neighboring country ..., that you ask for restructuring ... That is not the international doctrine." The ECB is proving a major stumbling block in agreeing a second rescue plan for Greece, threatening to refuse to accept restructured Greek bonds as collateral in its lending operations in the event of a default or a "restricted default." Refusing to accept Greek bonds as collateral would deprive Greek banks of the funds on which they rely, crippling the Greek economy and risking contagion to other euro zone economies. By threatening to use this 'nuclear option', the ECB hopes to press the governments into avoiding a downgrade to default status, and the contagion it fears would follow. Trichet met Greek Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos in Frankfurt earlier on Thursday. National central banks can provide commercial lenders with liquidity via the Emergency Liquidity Assistance (ELA) facility -- a tool Ireland's central bank is already using to give its domestic banks back-door access to funds.
