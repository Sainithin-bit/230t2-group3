 (Reuters) - Brokerage Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, a joint venture between Morgan Stanley and Citigroup, said personal information of 34,000 investment clients stored on two CDs was lost in transit to a government office last month, the Wall Street Journal reported citing a company spokesman. 

 The CDs were protected by passwords but not encrypted and went missing after the company mailed them to the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance, the Journal reported on its website. The package appeared to be intact when it reached the department but the discs were gone by the time the package reached the intended recipient, the Journal cited the spokesman as saying. The information on the CDs included client names, addresses, account and tax identification numbers, the income earned on the investments in 2010 and some clients' Social Security numbers, the Journal reported. The state office told the company about the missing CDs on June 8th and the company informed clients of the lost CDs in a letter mailed June 24. The brokerage has not seen evidence of criminal intent or misuse of information and will offer a year of credit monitoring services by a third party for clients whose Social Security numbers were on the discs, the Journal reported. Morgan Stanley Smith Barney could not be immediately reached for comment. (Reporting by Abhishek Takle in Bangalore; Editing by  Bernard Orr )
