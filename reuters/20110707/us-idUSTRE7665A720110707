 LONDON  (Reuters) - All those responsible for wrongdoing at the News of the World newspaper should be brought to justice, a spokesman for British Prime Minister David Cameron said after Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation announced it would close the tabloid. 

 "What matters is that all wrongdoing is exposed and those responsible for these appalling acts are brought to justice," the spokesman said. "As the Prime Minister has made clear, he is committed to establishing rigorous public inquiries to make sure this never happens in our country again."
