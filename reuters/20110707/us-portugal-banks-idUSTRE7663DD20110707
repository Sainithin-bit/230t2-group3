 LISBON  (Reuters) - All Portuguese banks undergoing financial stress tests are likely to make the grade, the head of the Portuguese Banking Association (APB), Antonio de Sousa, said on Thursday. 

 He also hailed as "very important" the decision by the European Central Bank to waive its rules on minimum credit ratings for accepting Portuguese debt as collateral for its loans to banks. De Sousa expected "no practical impact" on the financing of Portuguese banks with the ECB from Portugal's rating downgrade to junk status by Moody's earlier this week. Euro zone sources told Reuters last week the European Banking Authority was set to announce within weeks that between 10 and 15 of the 91 banks being tested had failed the tests, with failures expected in Greece, Germany, Portugal and Spain. The EBA said later speculation was unfounded as the results were not yet ready. "I'd be very surprised if any of our banks failed the tests," de Sousa told Reuters. "Sincerely, I don't think so" (that any would fail), he said, adding that the country's banks had shown sufficient resilience to the crisis. "At this moment, almost all banks, if not all, have core-Tier 1 ratios next to nine percent," he said. Portuguese banks are required to reach the nine-percent capital ratio at the end of 2011 under Portugal's bailout agreement with the European Union and IMF. The Portuguese banks being tested are state-run Caixa Geral de Depositos (CGD), the country's largest-listed bank Millennium bcp, the holding company of Banco Espirito Santo (BES) and Banco BPI. Moody's Investors Service earlier on Thursday downgraded government-guaranteed debt issued by Portuguese banks following Tuesday's sovereign rating cut, but de Sousa expected no impact on the financing the banks get from the ECB, especially after the suspension of ratings requirements. "It's a very important and welcome measure, a correct step on behalf of the ECB," de Sousa said. The heads of BPI and BES on Wednesday called on the European Union to set up its own credit ratings criteria and stop using U.S.-based agencies such as Moody's. De Sousa said the rating cut represented "a judgment by Moody's meaning that they consider all the work done by the European institutions and the IMF as junk." (Writing by Andrei Khalip)
