 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - The European Central Bank could raise interest rates again this year, but it has not yet decided whether to do so, ECB Governing Council member Luc Coene said on Thursday. 

 "We will clearly look, based on the conditions to what degree we must go on," Coene, who is governor of Belgium's central bank, told Belgian public radio station Radio 1 when asked if a further rate hike would come this year. "But the European Central Bank never takes decisions in advance, always takes decisions on the basis of information available at each time and based on the developments it could indeed be that we go in that direction," he continued. Earlier on Thursday, the ECB raised interest rates for a second time in three months and signaled that a further hike was likely this year. (Reporting by  Philip Blenkinsop )
