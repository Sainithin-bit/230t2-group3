 DUBLIN  (Reuters) - The European Central Bank will not give Ireland the medium-term liquidity facility its government says it needs to boost confidence in its struggling banks, ECB president Jean-Claude Trichet said on Thursday. 

 Trichet also indicated that the ECB would not allow Ireland to impose haircuts on senior bondholders in two defunct lenders, saying that the government must adhere to an EU/IMF bailout deal that does allow for such a move. The comments are the latest rebuff to Irish lobbying to the ECB, the European Union and the International Monetary Fund to ease the terms of an 85 billion euros ($122 billion) bailout from the three organizations as Dublin bids to return to debt markets. The ECB last month extended over 100 billion euros of liquidity to Ireland's banking sector to plug a funding shortfall as part of an ad-hoc credit line. But the Irish government has repeatedly asked for a medium-term liquidity facility to boost confidence in the banks and the government, which guarantees their liabilities. Asked by Irish state broadcaster RTE whether there was a possibility that the ECB would offer a medium-term liquidity facility to replace the current ad-hoc system, Trichet said: "I do not think it is a possibility. It is not." The ECB was extending 102.3 billion euros of credit to Irish banks as of May 27. The Irish central bank is due to provide updated figures on Friday. Trichet indicated the ECB would not change its policy and allow Ireland to impose losses on senior bondholders in state-guaranteed banks. Asked if the ECB would allow Ireland to impose burden sharing on Irish Nationwide and Anglo Irish Bank, which are both being wound down, Trichet said Dublin must adhere to the bailout plan, which does not allow for such burden sharing. "We call for full respect for the plan. All the plan and nothing but the plan," Trichet said. "All this was said at the time." Trichet said the ECB's decision on Thursday to increase interest rates by 25 basis points was ultimately good for Ireland, even if it may hurt mortgage-holders in the short term. He also praised Ireland for its "remarkable efforts" to restructure and deleverage its banks and said the country was regaining its competitiveness.
