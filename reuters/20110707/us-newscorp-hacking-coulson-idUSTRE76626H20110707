 LONDON  (Reuters) - Scottish police were asked on Thursday to investigate evidence given in court by witnesses including former News of the World editor Andy Coulson following the latest developments in the phone hacking scandal engulfing the newspaper. 

 Coulson, who resigned as prime minister David Cameron's communications chief in January, appeared in December as a witness at the trial of Scottish politician Tommy Sheridan. During that case, Coulson repeated his statement that he had no knowledge of phone hacking during his time as editor of the newspaper, part of Rupert Murdoch's News Corp empire. "In light of emerging developments regarding the News of the World, the Crown has requested Strathclyde Police to enquire into the evidence given by certain witnesses in the trial of Tommy Sheridan," Scotland's Crown Office public prosecutor said in a statement. "Strathclyde Police have been asked to make a preliminary assessment and to report to the Area Procurator Fiscal at Glasgow for consideration of any further action," it added. Sheridan was jailed for three years in January after he was found guilty of lying in court during his previous successful defamation case against the News of the World. Coulson resigned from the News of the World in 2007 after a reporter and private detective were jailed for secretly listening to mobile phone messages of royal household staff. He quit as an aide to Cameron after fresh allegations of phone hacking surfaced. Critics of the prime minister have questioned his judgment in appointing Coulson. Cameron has promised a public inquiry after allegations that the newspaper listened in on voicemails sent to victims and relatives involved in some of the country's most notorious crimes.
