 LONDON  (Reuters) - Supermarket Sainsbury, cellphone operator O2 and a war veterans charity whose patron is Britain's Queen Elizabeth have joined a growing list of organizations to suspend ties with the News of the World as a scandal over hacking allegations deepens. 

 This Sunday's edition of the newspaper, part of Rupert Murdoch's stable of British titles, will look very different as advertisers bow to pressure from consumers, politicians and celebrities to boycott the News of the World. Following are comments from advertisers and campaign partners, many responding to a barrage of messages on Twitter: Bourne Leisure (Butlins, Haven Holidays, Warner Leisure) - "We review all our sources of advertising regularly and we will not be advertising in NoW (News of the World)." Coca-Cola - "We have no advertising currently running with the News of the World and none scheduled for the future. We are shocked by the new allegations that have been made." The Co-operative Group - "The Co-operative Group has taken the decision to suspend temporarily any further advertising and promotional activity with the News of the World until the outcome of the investigation is known. The Group is a consumer-owned business which adheres to strong ethical standards. These allegations have been met with revulsion by the vast majority of members who have contacted us." Dixons (Currys and PC World): "There are a number of factors that determine our media planning and we constantly review all the media we use. However, we do not comment on specific cases." easyJet - "EasyJet understands the concerns raised by the public, including many of our own staff and passengers, about these serious and shocking claims. Although we have advertised in the News of the World in the past we have no current plans to do so. We will actively monitor the situation and await the outcome of any investigation." Ford - "We are awaiting an outcome from the News of the World investigation and expect a speedy and decisive response. Pending this response we will be using alternative media within and outside News International Group instead of placing Ford advertising in the News of the World." Halifax (Lloyds Banking Group) - "In recognizing and responding to consumer reaction, Halifax has canceled an advertisement in this Sunday's News of the World. This was a tactical decision in the short term whilst we carefully consider our longer term position and its implications." Marks & Spencer - "M&S does not advertise with the NOTW. We do advertise with other News International titles, such as The Sun, The Times and The Sunday Times and will be monitoring the situation closely to see how it develops." McDonald's - Says it has not advertised in the News of the World since 2010 and has no plans to do so. It will continue to advertise in The Sun. Mitsubishi Motors Corp - "Mitsubishi Motors in the UK considers this type of activity- especially in such a distressing case- to be unbelievable, unspeakable and despicable. This is where we draw the line. It has therefore been necessary for us to pull all of our media advertising with the News of the World with immediate effect." Morrisons - Says it is monitoring the situation, has no plans to advertise in the News of the World this weekend and has not made any long term decisions. NPower - "We can confirm that we are suspending current advertising with the News of the World. We will continue to review our options going forward."

We'll continue to monitor the situation closely." Procter & Gamble - "We are very aware of the situation and share the growing concern amongst the public. We are monitoring it closely and will be reviewing our options. We will wait for the outcome of official investigations before commenting further." Renault - "Renault acknowledges the concerns raised regarding the allegations of phone hacking by the News of the World. We can confirm that we have no media advertising planned with the News of the World." Royal Bank of Scotland - The lender and owner of insurer Direct Line declines to comment. The Royal British Legion - The armed forces charity drops the News of the World as its campaigning partner and says its advertising budget with the wider News International group is under review: "We can't with any conscience campaign alongside News of the World on behalf of Armed Forces families while it stands accused of preying on these same families in the lowest depths of their misery. The hacking allegations have shocked us to the core." J Sainsbury - "Due to the rising concerns of our customers we are suspending any advertising in the News of the World until the outcome of the investigation."
