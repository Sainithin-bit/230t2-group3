 SUN VALLEY, Idaho  (Reuters) - Rupert Murdoch kept a low profile and managed to miss the press pack at Sun Valley on Wednesday, avoiding questions on the phone-hacking scandal at his company's UK tabloid paper and how it might hit its plan to take over satellite TV company BSkyB. 

 Murdoch, his wife Wendi, son Lachlan and several other senior News Corp executives are attending this year's Allen & Co gathering of some of the biggest names in media, technology and deal financing at a luxurious hideaway in the Sawtooth mountains of Idaho. Murdoch, who usually has a lively presence at the exclusive event, has been elusive so far to reporters and photographers, who typically wait around the fringes of the event for interview opportunities. His presence at this year's conference has been confirmed to Reuters by two sources who have seen him at private events. It was revealed this week that the News of the World Sunday tabloid had hacked into the voicemail of missing teenager Milly Dowler in 2002. She was later found murdered. There have been calls in the UK for News Corp to fire Murdoch's top UK executive, Rebekah Brooks, who was editor of the News of the World at the time of hacking incident. Murdoch came out in support of Brooks in a statement on Wednesday but described the allegations as "deplorable and unacceptable." He has recently appointed News Corp executive Joel Klein to oversee the investigation. Klein is one of the News Corp executives currently in Sun Valley. The years-long scandal has become a major distraction for Murdoch's UK operations just as it received UK government approval to buy the 61 percent of BSkyB it doesn't already own. News Corp has kick-started a process to decide how much it will pay for BSkyB. It is now expected to have to pay a significant premium above its original offer of 700p per share made in June 2010. Analysts now expect it will have to pay as much 1,000p as BSkyB's profits and cash flow have risen in the last year.
