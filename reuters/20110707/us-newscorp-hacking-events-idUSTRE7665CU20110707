 (Reuters) - Here are the main events in the long-running phone-hacking scandal which brought down the 168-year old News of the World tabloid on Thursday.

September 2010 - MPs ask parliament's standards watchdog to begin a new investigation into the hacking allegations at the Sunday tabloid and its former editor Andy Coulson. -- Pressure for a new investigation grew after the New York Times suggested News of the World reporters "routinely" sought to hack phones.
