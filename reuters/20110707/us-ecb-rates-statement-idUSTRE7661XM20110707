 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - The European Central Bank is expected to raise euro zone interest rates to 1.50 percent at its monthly policy meeting on Thursday. 

 Below are key points from the ECB's most recent policy statement compared with previous months'. Capitals have been added by Reuters for emphasis. OPENING PARAGRAPH: -- JUNE 9 -- "Continued UPWARD PRESSURE on overall INFLATION, mainly owing to energy and commodity prices. The underlying pace of MONETARY EXPANSION is GRADUALLY RECOVERING. Monetary liquidity remains ample, with the potential to ACCOMMODATE PRICE PRESSURES in the euro area. "The most recent data confirm the POSITIVE UNDERLYING MOMENTUM of economic activity in the euro area, while uncertainty remains elevated. Overall, our monetary policy stance remains ACCOMMODATIVE." "On balance, RISKS to the outlook for price stability are on the UPSIDE. Accordingly, STRONG VIGILANCE is warranted." -- MAY 5 -- "We continue to see UPWARD PRESSURE on overall inflation, mainly owing to energy and commodity prices. While the monetary analysis indicates that the underlying pace of monetary expansion is STILL MODERATE, monetary liquidity remains AMPLE and MAY FACILITATE THE ACCOMMODATION OF PRICE PRESSURES." "Recent economic data confirm the POSITIVE UNDERLYING MOMENTUM of economic activity in the euro area, with UNCERTAINTY CONTINUING TO BE ELEVATED." "With interest rates across the entire maturity spectrum remaining LOW and the monetary policy stance STILL ACCOMMODATIVE, we will continue to MONITOR VERY CLOSELY all developments with respect to upside risks to price stability." -- APRIL 7 -- "The adjustment of the current very accommodative monetary policy stance is warranted in the light of upside risks to price stability that we have identified in our economic analysis." "While our monetary analysis indicates that the underlying pace of MONETARY EXPANSION is still MODERATE, monetary LIQUIDITY remains ample and MAY FACILITATE THE ACCOMMODATION OF PRICE PRESSURES. All in all, it is essential that the recent price developments do not give rise to broad-based inflationary pressures over the medium term. "The stance of monetary policy remains ACCOMMODATIVE." "We will continue to MONITOR VERY CLOSELY all developments with respect to upside risks to price stability." ECONOMIC ANALYSIS: GDP -- JUNE 9 -- "Euro area exports should be supported by the ongoing expansion in the world economy." "The risks to this economic outlook remain BROADLY BALANCED in an environment of ELEVATED UNCERTAINTY." -- MAY 5 -- "Euro area exports should be supported by the ongoing expansion in the world economy." "In the Governing Council's assessment, the risks to this economic outlook remain BROADLY BALANCED in an environment of ELEVATED UNCERTAINTY." -- APRIL 7 -- "Euro area exports should be supported by the ONGOING RECOVERY IN THE WORLD ECONOMY." "The RISKS to this economic outlook remain BROADLY BALANCED in an environment of elevated uncertainty." INFLATION -- JUNE 9 -- "Inflation rates are likely to stay CLEARLY ABOVE 2 percent over the coming months. UPWARD PRESSURE on inflation, mainly from energy and commodity prices, is also DISCERNIBLE IN THE EARLIER STAGES OF THE PRODUCTION PROCESS." -- MAY 5 -- "Inflation rates are likely to stay CLEARLY ABOVE 2 percent over the coming months. UPWARD PRESSURE on inflation, mainly from energy and commodity prices, is also DISCERNIBLE IN THE EARLIER STAGES OF THE PRODUCTION PROCESS." "Risks to the medium-term outlook for price developments remain ON THE UPSIDE." -- APRIL 7 -- "Pressure stemming from the sharp increases in energy and food prices is also DISCERNIBLE IN THE EARLIER STAGES OF THE PRODUCTION PROCESS." "It is of PARAMOUNT IMPORTANCE that the rise in HICP inflation does NOT lead to SECOND-ROUND EFFECTS." "RISKS to the medium-term outlook for price developments remain on the UPSIDE." MONETARY ANALYSIS -- JUNE 9 -- "The underlying pace of monetary expansion is GRADUALLY RECOVERING." "Monetary liquidity accumulated prior to the period of financial market tensions remains ample, with THE POTENTIAL TO ACCOMMODATE PRICE PRESSURES in the euro area." -- MAY 5 -- "The underlying pace of monetary expansion is GRADUALLY PICKING UP, but remains MODERATE." "Monetary liquidity accumulated prior to the period of financial market tensions remains ample and MAY FACILITATE the ACCOMMODATION OF PRICE PRESSURES in the euro area." -- APRIL 7 -- "The underlying pace of monetary expansion is GRADUALLY PICKING UP, but remains MODERATE." "At the same time, MONETARY LIQUIDITY accumulated prior to the period of financial market tensions remains ample and MAY FACILITATE the accommodation of PRICE PRESSURES in the euro area." FISCAL POLICIES -- JUNE 9 -- "Need for many countries to underpin their budget targets with CONCRETE CONSOLIDATION measures in order to correct their excessive deficits by the commonly agreed deadlines." "The IMPLEMENTATION of credible fiscal adjustment strategies is CRUCIAL in view of ongoing financial market pressures." -- MAY 5 -- "Current information points to UNEVEN DEVELOPMENTS in countries' adherence to the agreed fiscal consolidation plans. There is a risk that, in some countries, FISCAL BALANCES MAY FALL BEHIND THE TARGETS agreed by the ECOFIN Council for the necessary and timely correction of excessive deficits." "It is ESSENTIAL THAT ALL GOVERNMENTS MEET THE FISCAL BALANCE TARGETS for 2011 that they have announced. WHERE NECESSARY, ADDITIONAL CORRECTIVE MEASURES MUST BE IMPLEMENTED SWIFTLY." -- APRIL 7 -- "Essential that all governments achieve the consolidation targets for 2011 that they have announced. Moreover, the announcement of fully specified consolidation measures for 2012 and beyond would help to CONVINCE the general public and market participants that the CORRECTIVE POLICIES WILL BE SUSTAINED."
