The dates are as follows: -- September 4 - Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. -- September 18 - Berlin. -- As early as September, Germany's center-right coalition is then due to discuss concrete proposals to cut billions of euros in income taxes to relieve lower and middle-income households starting in 2013, the year of the national election. -- In October the government will present updated economic forecasts that will then serve as the basis for semi-annual tax estimates published by a government panel the following month. Based on the amount of fiscal leeway, Merkel plans to unveil the size of her tax cut plan in November before the lower house approves the budget for 2012. -- Since even center-right state governments like Thueringia have signaled their opposition to cuts in income tax, any measures could easily be blocked by the Bundesrat. This could result in either a successful arbitration between the two houses, possibly involving the financing of cuts through a hike in the wealth tax. Merkel's coalition is alternately considering resorting to cuts in the "solidarity charge," which would benefit all taxpayers, including the rich. CONSTITUTIONAL COURT: -- Germany's constitutional court in Karlsruhe is due to give a ruling this year on the aid package for Greece and euro zone rescue package agreed last year. A hearing was held on July 5, but there is no firm date for a judgment. G7/G8/G20 MEETINGS: ------------------- -- September 9-10 - G7 finance ministers meet in Marseille. -- September 26-27 - G20 labor ministers meeting in Paris. -- October 14-15 - G20 finance ministers meeting in Paris. -- November 3-4 - G20 Annual Summit in Cannes, France.
