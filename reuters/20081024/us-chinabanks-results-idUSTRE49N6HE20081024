 HONG KONG  (Reuters) - Two of China's biggest banks posted quarterly profits on Friday, and while that is no small feat given the turmoil in global financial markets, their earnings growth saw a significant slow down. 

 Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Ltd, the world's largest bank by market value, said quarterly profit rose 25.5 percent on higher interest and fee income. China Construction Bank (CCB), the country's third-largest bank, said earnings rose by 12 percent on the quarter. But when compared with the same quarter last year, or the first half of this year, profit growth was noticeably sluggish. CCB's first-half earnings grew nearly 72 percent. During last year's third quarter, ICBC posted a 76-percent jump in profit thanks in part to fatter interest margins. China's banks, some of the largest in the world, have so far been spared much of the impact of a global markets meltdown because of their lower level of exposure to international securities. But analysts say a slowing Chinese economy, a trend of falling interest rates, and a potential sharp correction in the domestic property market that the banks have heavy exposure to could hurt the sector in 2009. Though signs of strain are starting to show, China's biggest financial groups are still in the black. "It was always going to slow down. You're at unsustainably high rates of growth. You've got margins which are coming off, and loan growth is healthy but fees are coming off, plus provisioning is going up," said Fox-Pitt Kelton analyst Warren Blight. "When you net them all together, it's inevitable that you're going to get a quarterly slowdown." CCB, which is about 11 percent owned by Bank of America, reported a July-September earnings increase of 12 percent at 25.6 billion yuan ($3.74 billion). ICBC reported earnings up 25.5 percent to 28.2 billion yuan ($4.12 billion). UBS expected July-September net profit to rise 17 percent from a year earlier to 26.36 billion yuan ($3.86 billion) under international accounting rules. Construction Bank's third-quarter earnings was expected to rise 3.6 percent to 23.86 billion yuan, according to UBS. Both banks subprime mortgage holdings and exposure to U.S. institutions such as Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and bankrupt Lehman Brothers was small compared to their overall assets. "You're now in a higher base with a number of drivers working against you," Blight said. "There really shouldn't be any surprises about that. You're still talking about fairly healthy profits. Sure the growth is slowing down but they're making real money." CCB and ICBC face challenges from a cooling economy, cuts in lending rates and rising defaults from Chinese companies and home owners. Interest earned on loans still comprises the vast majority of Chinese banks' operating income, making credit risk the chief worry among analysts and investors. But that has yet to really hurt the big banks. CCB's nonperforming loan ratio was 2.17 percent, down by 0.43 percentage points, while its core capital adequacy ratio was down slightly to 10.20 percent compared to the end of last year. ICBC's nonperforming loan ratio dipped slightly to 2.37 percent from the end of last year and said its core capital adequacy ratio was 10.51 percent, with both figures meeting regulatory requirements. Despite sitting in a relatively strong position, the lending climate has taken a bite out of both banks share price. Construction Bank's Hong Kong shares have slumped 56 percent so far this year, in line with a sharp drop in the benchmark Hang Seng Index. ICBC's Hong Kong shares are down around 43 percent.
