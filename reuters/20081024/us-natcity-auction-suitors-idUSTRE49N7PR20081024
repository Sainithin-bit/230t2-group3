 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - National City Corp NCC.N drew interest from more than one party, with US Bancorp ( USB.N ) and Bank of Nova Scotia ( BNS.TO ) also looking at buying the U.S. regional bank, sources familiar with the matter said on Friday. 

 But PNC Financial Services Group Inc ( PNC.N ) won the deal, agreeing to buy the Ohio-based lender in a government-supported $5.6 billion transaction to create the No. 5 U.S. bank by deposits. (Reporting by  Paritosh Bansal )
