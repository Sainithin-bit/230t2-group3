 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - While OPEC may be poised to reign in output after a sharp drop in oil over the past three months, lower prices could actually serve the interest of some of the group's members, including Saudi Arabia, Edward Morse, chief economist for LCM Commodities, said on Thursday. 

 The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries is widely expected to cut production when it holds an emergency meeting on Friday in Vienna after U.S. oil prices dropped from a record $147 a barrel in July to below $69. "It is clearly the case that OPEC is going to cut, it's a question of by how much," Morse told Reuters in an interview. "I suspect that OPEC will be cutting less in reality than is required to balance the market." Price hawk Iran said cuts of 2 million barrels per day (bpd) could be necessary, while OPEC's core Gulf producers favor a reduction of about one million bpd. Crude prices have tumbled as demand in the United States and other large consumers slows due to the growing financial crisis, lowering revenues to oil exporting states. While many members coming out in favor of a supply reduction, some members have said they do not wish to add to the problems facing the global economy. Ali al-Naimi, oil minister for OPEC kingpin Saudi Arabia, said on Thursday that the market would determine the price of crude. Morse said some OPEC members, including U.S. ally Saudi Arabia as well as other Gulf countries, may see lower prices in their interest for a while despite the economic hit their oil-reliant economies might take. "It is quite clear that the high prices are providing money to oil producing countries like Venezuela, Iran and (non-OPEC) Russia, to give you three examples where money is being put to uses that relate to the promotion of (their) national interests abroad," said Morse. "The international interest abroad of Iran and Russia, in particular, strikes me as being against the Saudi interest," he added. Tensions between Russia -- a large, independent oil producer which has sought closer ties with OPEC -- and the West have mounted after Russia sent troops and tanks into Georgia in August to repel an offensive by the Georgian military to retake pro-Russian South Ossetia. Problems between Washington and the governments of Venezuela and Iran have escalated over the years, with Venezuela's left-wing President Hugo Chavez accusing the Bush administration of plotting against him. Washington and other western governments are concerned that Iran could use its nuclear program to develop weapons. Record high oil prices also sparked increased investment of alternative fuels in consumer nations. (Editing by Marguerita Choy)
