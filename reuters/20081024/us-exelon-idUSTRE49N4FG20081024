 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Power company Exelon Corp which has launched an unsolicited bid for NRG Energy Inc, posted lower third-quarter earnings on Friday, hurt by increased costs and weather-related problems. 

 The company also said it increased its quarterly dividend by 5 percent. Net income fell to $700 million, or $1.06 a share, from $780 million, or $1.15 a share, a year ago. Excluding items, quarterly earnings decreased to $706 million, or $1.07 a share, from $823 million, or $1.21 a share. Exelon ( EXC.N ), the largest nuclear power plant operator in the nation and the owner of the Commonwealth Edison and PECO utilities, launched its bid for NRG Energy ( NRG.N ) earlier this week in a move to create the largest U.S. power producer. NRG Energy has not responded to Exelon's bid, which was valued at about $5.7 billion, or $24.19 per NRG Energy share, as of Thursday's close. The fourth-quarter dividend was raised to 52.5 cents a share and is payable on December 10. (Reporting by  Euan Rocha  and  Matt Daily ; editing by Jeffrey Benkoe)
