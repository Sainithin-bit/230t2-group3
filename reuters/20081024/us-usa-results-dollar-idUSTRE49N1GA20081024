 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - If money makes the world go round, corporate leaders must feel like their heads are spinning. 

 Simultaneously facing a credit crisis, a global collapse in demand and plunging stock prices, U.S. multinationals must also manage through the most volatile foreign exchange environment in a generation. Partway through the earnings reporting season, scores of companies have said foreign exchange (FX) would hurt fourth-quarter results, even in cases where it was a benefit as recently as the third quarter. In a few cases, companies have held off commenting about 2009 because of currency volatility. For investors, a rapid rise in the U.S. dollar this month means earnings estimates for many multinational companies will have to come down further. "I don't think people have caught on to the FX effect," said Jeff Markunas, lead manager of the RidgeWorth Large Cap Core Equity Fund. "The fourth quarter is likely to be so bad it will force analysts to accelerate their estimate cutting. I think the currency headwind gets progressively worse until this time next year." A stampede into dollars has lifted the world's reserve currency to a two-year high versus the euro and a five-year high on the pound. The dollar is up some 18 percent since July on a trade-weighted basis against a basket of currencies. Some emerging market currencies -- such as the Mexican peso, the Polish zloty and the Hungarian forint -- have lost a quarter of their value since Lehman Brothers' bankruptcy a month ago, as investors flee risk. 'BIGGEST HEADWINDS' Corporate leaders are taking notice. "Apart from the obvious worries about the U.S., the biggest headwinds that we see for now are a reversal of currency gains and slowing economies in Western Europe, Canada and Japan," George Buckley, 3M's chief executive, said on Tuesday. Dow component 3M Co gets some two-thirds of its revenue from outside its home market. The benefit to sales from a weak dollar in the most recent quarter was half of what it was three months earlier, and the dollar's reversal could cut fourth-quarter sales by up to 4 percentage points. Tom Falk, Kimberly-Clark's CEO, told analysts: "Given the significant change in foreign currency exchange rates over the last month, we would expect that currency will be a drag on our comparisons instead of the benefit (it has been) over the past several years." One positive is that a stronger dollar helps cut the cost of commodities: steel, copper and oil are much cheaper than just a few weeks ago. But since that retreat reflects expectations of weakness, it is not unalloyed good news. Global employment services provider Manpower Inc, dependent on foreign sales, warned about fourth-quarter profits amid weakening world economies. Analysts slashed 2009 estimates. A Merrill Lynch analysis estimated the dollar, at current levels, will cut 2009 profit by 43 cents a share, more than reversing the 40-cent benefit Manpower got in 2008. At Tupperware Brands Corp, another company that gets the lion's share of its profit outside the United States, said a 1 percentage point move in the dollar affects earnings by about 3 cents a share. For a company forecast to earn $2.60 per share this year, that single factor could make a huge difference. PAIN A'PLENTY A strong dollar also hurts U.S. companies by making U.S. exports less attractive, potentially giving European or Asian rivals a competitive edge. A recent survey by the Manufacturers Alliance found a large majority of exporters improved their competitive position when the dollar was falling. That may now reverse: 80 percent said their exports to Europe are affected by the exchange rate. As large U.S. companies globalized in recent years, many made an effort to produce close to where they sell. As a result, a stronger dollar can reduce foreign expenses for companies that manufacture overseas, or have foreign debts. Caterpillar, for example, recorded a gain last quarter as the strengthening dollar reduced its liabilities in Europe. That is a point stressed by Philip Morris International Inc, which sells tobacco products in 160 world markets. Its chief financial officer, Hermann Waldemer, cautioned analysts not to overestimate the impact of euro weakness, considering the company exports from the EU to Asia and runs a research center in Switzerland whose costs are in Swiss francs. Companies that generate revenue overseas but have minor expenses there, such as Google Inc and Yahoo Inc, don't enjoy such benefits, said Kathy Lien director of currency research at Global Forex Trading in New York. Lien, who predicts the dollar could gain another 5 percent in the near term, added that volatile forex markets will make more companies think about setting up local operations, and more will be aggressively hedging. Google said the strong dollar reduced its quarterly revenue by $59 million, partly offset by a hedging program. It called hedging an insurance policy, and plans to hedge more over the coming year. PLAYING THE GAME Besides locking in exchange rates through hedging -- a tactic that can prove costly, as some Latin American companies have discovered -- options are limited. Shifting sourcing from one country to another does not happen overnight; cutting production or jobs is costly and poses the risk of being hit by an unexpected upturn. Many companies do not try to guess exchange rates. Volatile currencies and commodities kept Caterpillar from making a preliminary 2009 profit forecast, which it normally provides for the coming year in October. Merck & Co CFO Peter Kellogg told Reuters he was not greatly concerned about exchange rates turning against the company, which gets more than 40 percent of its sales abroad. "If forex helps us, that's a good thing, if it hurts us a little bit, so be it," Kellogg said. Still, the full impact of the dollar rally has yet to hit, said Brian Langenberg, principal of asset management and research firm Langenberg & Co. For U.S. industrials -- among the most global of American names -- earnings estimates are still too high by as much as 25 percent, he said. Currency is certainly an annoyance, but the real problem is plunging demand, Langenberg said. "The bad news is the economy is in the toilet globally, and nobody wants to buy anything."
