 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - California cities are cutting services, freezing payrolls and even considering paring spending on public safety as the housing crisis and Wall Street turmoil puts a financial squeeze on city halls across the state. 

 A number of cash-strapped cities are also issuing pink slips, starting with those employed in nonessential services. But in San Diego, the most populous U.S. state's second largest city, officials are mulling the once unthinkable in the face of a $43 million budget gap. "We're even looking at public safety cuts, which we've never done," said Jay Goldstone, the city's chief operating officer. "We thought we were going to be OK getting through the fiscal year," he added. "In April and May, we thought we were putting a fairly conservative budget together, but things went from bad to worse." California is often a political trendsetter so how its high-profile mayors, including those of  San Francisco and Los Angeles, make the case for spending cuts as property tax collections weaken may be imitated elsewhere, especially where housing markets are in a funk and reducing property tax revenues. California's housing downturn has worsened this year as mortgage lenders tightened credit needed to buy homes in the state's pricier local markets. Meanwhile, home prices in the state's more affordable local markets have tumbled amid a glut of foreclosures. San Francisco is also bracing for its financial services industry to shrink amid the turmoil on Wall Street, one reason the city's controller said on Tuesday the city's best case scenario entails cuts of $70 million to $80 million from its current fiscal year spending to maintain a balanced budget. In Los Angeles, California's biggest city, Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa this week ordered limits on city hiring, overtime and purchasing in the face of shortfall that may hit $400 million for the city's fiscal year beginning next July. Villaraigosa in a memorandum to city officials stressed it would be imperative for all city departments to "comply with belt-tightening measures." FACING UP TO DOWNTURNS San Jose Mayor Chuck Reed told Reuters on Wednesday his city, the third largest in California, cannot avoid spending cuts because its sales tax revenues are down 3 percent instead of an expected drop of 1 percent. "At midyear, we will undoubtedly have to make some reductions to get ready for next year," Reed said. Sales tax revenues are also down in San Diego as consumers rein in spending and tourism-related tax revenues are slowing, but those are less worrisome than shrinking property tax revenues amid the prolonged housing slump, San Diego's Goldstone said. "What we're seeing is a decline in property tax revenues with a majority of that coming in delinquencies," he said. While California cities are beset by falling revenues, they are moving quickly to address that, which is reassuring to credit ratings agencies. "Seeing these cutbacks or these budget measures and contingencies are good responses from a bondholders' standpoint," said Amy Doppelt, a managing director at Fitch Ratings. "The other option would be looking at ways to raise revenues, but that would be much slower to occur." Standard & Poor's director Ian Carroll likewise expects an aggressive push to cut or contain costs. "You're going to see vacant positions unfilled, hiring freezes, delayed capital spending and perhaps even tapping cash reserves," he said. Tax increases would require winning over voters next year. To raise revenue quickly local officials may instead turn to increasing fees and fines, said Eric Hoffman, a public finance analyst at Moody's Investors Service. "They're going to nip and tuck and tighten up wherever they can," Hoffman said. "It appears cities have jumped on this," he added. "That gives us comfort that credit quality can be maintained."
