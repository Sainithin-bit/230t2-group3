 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Shares of U.S. banks tumbled before the bell on Friday as global markets sold off on fears the global economy is in the throes of recession. 

 Among the losers, shares of Citigroup ( C.N ) tumbled 9 percent to $11.95 before the bell, while those of Goldman Sachs ( GS.N ) slid more than 8 percent to $99.48. The Financial Select Sector SPDR XLF.A , an exchange-traded fund which tracks the performance of stocks in the Standard & Poor's 500 financials group, slid 6.1 percent to $13.60.
