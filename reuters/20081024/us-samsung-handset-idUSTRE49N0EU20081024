 SEOUL  (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics Co Ltd ( 005930.KS ), the world's second-biggest mobile phone maker, said on Friday it sold 51.8 million mobile phones in the third quarter, compared with 45.7 million units in the second. 

 Profit margins at its telecom division nearly halved to 7 percent in July-September from 13 percent in the previous quarter. "Despite seasonal strength expected in the fourth quarter, growth of global mobile phone markets will slow down...but we expect to achieve our sales target of 200 million units," Samsung said in a results statement. Samsung, also the world's largest maker of liquid crystal display (LCD) screens, said profit margins at its LCD business fell to 8 percent from 21 percent in the second quarter.
