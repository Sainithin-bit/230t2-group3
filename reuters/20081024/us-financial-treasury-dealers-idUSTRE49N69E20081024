 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury said on Friday it is asking primary dealers of Treasury securities how a series of government interventions to prevent financial market meltdown is impacting credit markets. 

 The Treasury, as part of events surrounding its November quarterly refunding announcement, asked firms that directly buy and sell government debt securities whether Treasury should make any changes to its auction calendar or offerings given the Treasury's financing needs and trends in the fiscal outlook. The Treasury is holding quarterly meetings with primary dealers October 30. (Reporting by  Mark Felsenthal ; Editing by Tom Hals)
