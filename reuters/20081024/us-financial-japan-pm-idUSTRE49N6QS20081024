 BEIJING  (Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Taro Aso said on Friday he was worried that the global economic downturn and rapid moves in foreign exchange and stock markets could hurt the real economy, particularly the export sector. 

 As Japan's Nikkei average slid 9.6 percent and the dollar tumbled to a 13-year trough against the yen, Aso stepped up his warning to markets, saying rapid fluctuations in the currency and share prices were "most undesirable." "I don't think the Japanese economy is in bad shape, but the global economic slump could push down our exports," Aso told reporters ahead of the two-day Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) of 27 EU member states and 16 Asian countries in Beijing. Whenever currencies fluctuate wildly, Tokyo usually has various code words to warn financial markets. Japanese policymakers usually start sending a message to markets by saying they are watching their moves carefully, and if moves continue, they add stronger warnings by saying those moves are rapid and undesirable, holding out the ultimate option of intervening directly in the market. Still, since early 2004, Japan has stayed away from its old habit of intervening in the currency market to prevent a rising yen from crippling the nation's export-led growth. In a possible sign that Aso may not be keen to act on currencies, at least for now, the premier later in the day said the yen's rise was not always a bad thing as the country has benefited from it, notably in the fall in crude oil costs. Aso also repeated he would not fret over daily market moves. BIG PROBLEM Aso, who used to head a cement company and tries to talk about the economy from a businessman's point of view, seems to be more concerned about rapid moves in Tokyo share prices. He called them a "big problem" and "troublesome," adding that the global financial crisis is partly caused by a lack of trust between investors and governments. The Nikkei slid to a 5-year closing low on Friday, bringing the fall for the year to 50 percent, hit by the double punch of a Sony Corp profit warning and a surge in the yen. The Japanese currency hit 13-year highs against the dollar at 90.95 yen, while the euro at one point fell more than 10 percent against the yen to hit a low of 113.82 yen. Japan's exports showed anemic growth in September, data showed on Thursday, as the spreading global financial crisis ate into U.S. and European demand for Japanese goods. "Some foreign investors are beginning to worry about what the Japanese government will do," said Koji Fukaya, senior currency strategist at Deutsche Securities in Tokyo. "They will need a good cause to intervene in the currency market, but after the G7 meeting, it seems as if any step is allowed as long as it will help stop the market turmoil," he added, referring to the meeting of finance ministers and central bank governors from Group of Seven rich nations this month. The government is expected to compile a second economic stimulus package in the next week, with proposals widely expected to include tax cuts, a bank bailout scheme and small business relief measures. Speculation of an interest rate cut has grown and some analysts say that could be a way of halting the yen's rapid advance and saving the world's No. 2 economy, which shrank at the sharpest rate in seven years in the second quarter. "The probability of a rate cut is getting higher. The yen's rise across the board has not had clear impact on the real economy yet, but an early attempt to prevent adverse effects may be needed," said Hideo Kumano, chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute. The Bank of Japan has unveiled a raft of measures to ease money market strains in recent weeks, joining other major central banks. But it has so far ruled out cutting its key interest rates from the current 0.5 percent, maintaining a distinction between steps to help markets and decisions on interest rate policy.
