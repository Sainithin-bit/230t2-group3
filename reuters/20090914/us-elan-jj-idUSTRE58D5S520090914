 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Elan Corp Plc ( ELN.I ) has resolved a disputed partnership agreement with Biogen Idec Inc ( BIIB.O ), lowering the price Johnson & Johnson ( JNJ.N ) will pay for a minority stake in the Irish drugmaker. 

 Elan said in a statement on Monday it has "cured an unintended breach of its Tysabri collaboration agreement with Biogen." The company said J&J will invest $885 million in Elan in exchange for 18.4 percent of Elan's outstanding shares. The deal had previously called for a $1 billion payment. Elan said J&J will still pay $500 million to acquire a major stake in Elan's portfolio of experimental Alzheimer's drugs. A U.S. District Court ruled earlier this month that Elan's pending deal with J&J violated Elan's 50-50 partnership to sell multiple sclerosis drug Tysabri with Biogen, a Cambridge, Massachusetts-based biotech company whose shareholders include billionaire investor Carl Icahn.
