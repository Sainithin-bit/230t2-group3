 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The United States is certain President Barack Obama's decision to curb tire imports from China can withstand legal scrutiny by the World Trade Organization, a U.S. trade official said on Monday. 

 "In this case, the United States is confident that our action is fully WTO consistent," the trade official said on condition of anonymity. Beijing has reacted angrily to Obama's decision to impose a 35 percent tariff on Chinese-made tires after the United Steelworkers union complained that imports tripled between 2004 and 2008 to about 46 million tires. China has asked for talks on the issue at the WTO and said it has launched a pair of anti-dumping investigations against U.S. poultry and autos. The United States welcomes the opportunity to explain to China why it believes the tire action is consistent with an anti-surge provision that China accepted when it joined the WTO in 2001, the trade official said. "It's important to remember the U.S. has a broad and deep relationship with China, and we continue to look forward to working with China constructively." "Working through issues like this, as we have with the EU and other major trading partners, is a normal component of a robust economic relationship," the official said. The United States imposed the curbs only after "an unprecedented effort" to reach a negotiated solution with China failed, the official said. The U.S. Trade Representative's office is seeking information on China's statement it would begin anti-dumping investigations on U.S. poultry and auto products. "At this time, we have no information on these dumping cases, but we'll be inquiring closely in coming days to understand whether there is basis for (China) acting," the trade official said.
