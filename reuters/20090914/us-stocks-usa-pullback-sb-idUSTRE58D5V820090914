 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Wall Street strategists expect to see U.S. stocks pull back in the near term but eventually to end the year higher following their 50 percent rebound since March's lows. 

 "As we began the week, we suspected that the capital markets reached an inflection point ... We believe that the window for a correction is open," Barry Knapp, analyst at Barclays Capital, said in a research note to clients on Sunday. Knapp said the slowing of Fed liquidity into asset classes indirectly impacted by quantitative easing and a significant increase in bank Real Estate Owned (REO) are potential catalysts for a pullback. However, despite the tactical view of a near-term pullback in stocks, credit is no longer as attractive relative to equities as previously. High-quality sectors of the credit market seem fully priced and will have less incremental leverage as the economy improves, Knapp said. He also said in addition to early signs of fundamental improvement in the industrials sector, the technology sector continues to show strong performance. Tobias Levkovich, Citigroup's chief U.S. equity strategist, said it is difficult for the market to ignore a 54 percent move in the S&P 500 off the March 2009 lows. "Markets may be due for a modest correction," Levkovich wrote in a research note. "Especially when one recalls that equity markets, on average, have rebounded 40 percent one year after hitting recession-related troughs and 47 percent two years after such lows." Levkovich downgraded diversified financials sector to "market weight" from "overweight," saying the cut reflects expectations for no meaningful incremental return for the S&P 500 into year-end 2009 and only modest gains from here into year-end 2010. As of Monday's close, the Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  was at 1,049.23, up 53.2 percent from its close on March 9. (Reporting by  Angela Moon , Editing by Kenneth Barry)
