 BEIJING  (Reuters) - China has requested WTO-sanctioned consultations with the United States over Washington's new duties on Chinese-made tires, a spokesman for China's Commerce Ministry said. 

 The spokesman, Yao Jian, said the tire duties announced by Washington on Friday were in "violation of WTO rules". "China has requested consultations with the United States, which is a legitimate use of its rights as a member of the WTO," Yao said in a statement on the Ministry's website (www.mofcom.gov.cn). Under World Trade Organization rules, member nations can request such talks as a prelude to seeking a ruling from the organization. (Reporting by Chris Buckley; Editing by Chris Lewis)
