 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - President Barack Obama wants the U.S. Congress to pass financial regulatory reform this year and will be personally involved in helping it advance, top economic adviser Larry Summers said on Friday. 

 Obama will make a speech on Monday in New York to mark the fall of Lehman Brothers a year ago, using that event to push for changes he has long championed as necessary to put the economy on a sound footing going forward. Summers laid out a broad case for the measures Obama has proposed. Financial institutions should not be able to choose their regulators, he said, and they must face supervision if their failure would disrupt the financial system. Summers told reporters he believed Senate committees could move forward on the legislation despite the ongoing debate over healthcare reform and said the president was concerned about the measures being watered down by lobbyists. Summers also said the United States was shifting focus to sustained economic recovery rather than rescue and noted that unemployment levels -- which the administration expects to peak at 10 percent -- would remain "unacceptably high" for a number of years.
