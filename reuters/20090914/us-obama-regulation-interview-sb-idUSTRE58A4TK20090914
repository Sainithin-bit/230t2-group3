 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The Obama administration still sees passing financial regulatory reform legislation as a top priority this year, White House adviser Christina Romer told Reuters in an interview on Friday. 

 "It is absolutely a top priority," Romer told Reuters Television. She said the administration did not want to lose this window of opportunity to pass reform to avoid another major financial crisis in the future. President Barack Obama will discuss the issue on the anniversary of Lehman Brothers' collapse on Monday. "The most important thing we can do to make sure that we never find ourselves in this situation again is to put in place the comprehensive set of reforms that were announced last spring and that we are now working (on) with Congress," Romer said.
