 PARIS  (Reuters) - French economy minister Christine Lagarde on Saturday welcomed the adoption of a U.S. bank rescue plan and hoped it would be implemented soon. 

 "The Paulson plan brings confidence back, now it needs to be put in place," she said during a visit to the Paris Auto Show. "We have said that the economic situation is difficult, growth has slowed down sharply and we will end the year with growth around 1 percent," she said.
