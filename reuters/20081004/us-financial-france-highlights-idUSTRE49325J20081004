 (Reuters) - French President Nicolas Sarkozy on Saturday hosted a meeting to discuss the financial crisis. 

 British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet, European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso and Eurogroup Chairman Jean-Claude Juncker were all at the meeting. Below are some highlights of their comments on the way into the meeting. MERKEL "The politicians have to take responsibility in this very difficult situation, but those who have caused the damage must contribute to the solution." SARKOZY "Take Angela Merkel's words and translate them into French and that's exactly what I think. "We have a global problem, we need a global response and in the world today, Europe must show its determination to present a solution. That will reassure everybody." BROWN "I want the message to go out of this meeting today that no sound, solvent bank should be allowed to fail for lack of liquidity." "The signal will be very clear that every country represented here today will want to do whatever is necessary to secure the stability of the system and to ensure the safety of their hardworking families and businesses in each of our countries."
