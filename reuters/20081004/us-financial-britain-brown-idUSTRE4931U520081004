 PARIS  (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Gordon Brown said on Saturday he wanted European Union leaders meeting in Paris to make clear that they will not let major banks in their respective countries fail. 

 "I want the message to go out of this meeting today that no sound, sovereign bank should be allowed to fail for lack of liquidity," Brown said as he arrived for the meeting with the leaders of France, Italy, Germany and Luxembourg. "The signal will be very clear that every country represented here today will want to do whatever is necessary to secure the stability of the system and to ensure the safety of their hardworking families and businesses in each of our countries," he added.
