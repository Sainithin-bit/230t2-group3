 PARIS  (Reuters) - Those responsible for the financial crisis must contribute to the solution, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Saturday. 

 "The politicians have to take responsibility in this very difficult situation, but those who have caused the damage must contribute to the solution," she said on the way into a meeting with French President Nicolas Sarkozy and other EU leaders to try and find a common response to the crisis.
