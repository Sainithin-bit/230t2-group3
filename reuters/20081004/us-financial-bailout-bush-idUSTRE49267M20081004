 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - President George W. Bush is expected to speak after the House of Representatives votes on Friday on legislation aimed at rescuing the U.S. financial system, White House spokesman Tony Fratto said. 

 "You can expect to hear from the president at some point after the vote," he said. He said Bush had continued to talk to lawmakers and that the White House was optimistic that the legislation had a chance of passing the House. Fratto also said he expected the president to sign it as quickly as possible once it passed Congress but declined to be more specific on timing.
