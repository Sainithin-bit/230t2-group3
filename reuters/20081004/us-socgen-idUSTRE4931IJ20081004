 PARIS  (Reuters) - French bank Societe Generale ( SOGN.PA ), hit by a massive rogue trading scandal this year, is solid and is ready to look at acquisitions, chief executive Frederic Oudea told Le Parisien newspaper. 

 "Societe Generale is the tenth (biggest) company on the CAC 40 and the sixth bank in the euro zone. It has the means to develop on its own," Oudea said. "If there are possibilities for acquisitions at accessible prices, we will study them. We will also develop partnerships such as we have with La Poste (postal service) and Groupama (insurance firm)," he said. He said a tie-up with BNP Paribas was not on the cards. "A merger with BNP Paribas would destroy value for the two banks and also for the entire French economy" he said. "Societe Generale is solid, profitable and has a comfortable cushion of capital," he said. (Reporting by  Marcel Michelson ; Editing by Ruth Pitchford)
