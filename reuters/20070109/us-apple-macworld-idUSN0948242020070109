 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Apple Computer Inc. on Tuesday unveiled an iPod mobile phone featuring a large, smooth color screen, sending its shares up 8 percent as the company attempts to parlay its dominance in digital music players into new areas of growth. 

 Shaped like a thin deck of cards without the normal buttons or flip top on a mobile phone, Apple's device features a 3.5 inch touch screen for navigating phone calls and playing songs and videos. The gadget, which will be available only to Cingular Wireless subscribers, is thinner than some of the cell phone industry's most svelte devices, including Motorola Inc.'s sleek RAZR line. The iPod phone will cost $499 to $599 when it debuts in the United States in June. Apple Chief Executive Steve Jobs predicted that in 2008 Apple could sell 10 million iPhones, representing roughly 1 percent of the current annual mobile phone market of 1 billion units a year. Mobile phones represent the biggest major consumer electronics market in the world. "It's definitely a compelling product," said Josh Martin, an analyst at Yankee Group. "The functionality of the device seems like it's far beyond anything that's available today," he said, although he questioned whether the memory in the Apple phones was sufficient. The iPhone, with both 4 gigabyte and 8 gigabyte models, combines features of the company's wildly popular iPod -- viewing digital content such as movies, music and pictures -- with the ability to make phone calls, send e-mail and surf the Internet. MACWORLD DEBUT Jobs made the announcement at the company's annual Macworld conference and predicted the iPhone would boost the company's fortunes with the same impact as two former blockbusters -- the Mac computer and iPod. "Apple has been very fortunate that it has been able to introduce a few of these" hits, he said, referring to the introduction of the Mac in 1984 and the iPod in 2001. "We are advancing the state of the art in every aspect." Apple, which also announced it would drop "Computer" from its name, said the iPhone battery lasts for five hours for talking and browsing - comparable to rival smart phones on the market -- and 15 hours for playing music. Cingular Wireless, the No. 1 U.S. wireless network and a unit of AT&T Inc., has a multiyear and exclusive agreement to provide U.S. service for the iPhone, Cingular Chief Executive Stan Sigman said. There were about 900 million mobile phones sold worldwide last year, a figure that is expected to rise to more than 1 billion in 2007, according to industry analysts. Analysts treated the new device as a potentially huge source of growth for Apple as it looks for new sources of revenue and ways to build on its more than 70-percent share of the U.S. market for MP3 digital music players. They cautioned, however, that the high price would keep the iPhone from becoming a mass market hit soon. "This (iPhone) does have the potential to shake up the competitive landscape even if it's not a device that's targeted to mass consumers," said Stanford Group analyst Michael Nelson. "It's clearly targeted toward the highest value subscribers and they are the most profitable subscribers." The 11.6 millimeter (0.46 inch) phone includes the 3.5-inch wide touchscreen display and a 2 megapixel camera. The phone runs Apple's OS X operating system, has the Safari browser for Internet searching and e-mail functions that can handle graphics and work with external services. The iPhone can also connect to the Internet using Wi-Fi wireless technology, and has Bluetooth, the short-range wireless technology used to support wireless headsets or link to other devices such as printers. APPLETV TO SHIP IN FEBRUARY Jobs also said that AppleTV, the newly renamed device that allows users to stream movies, music, photos, podcasts and TV shows to their home entertainment systems, would ship in February. The 40-gigabyte machine will cost $299, the same price Jobs forecast back in September. Sam Rahman, a portfolio manager at Baring Asset Management Inc., which owns Apple shares, said the iPhone and AppleTV, could prove to be big boosts for the company. "Right now the stock is trading on product announcements," he said. "It could drive additional growth for Apple at a time when they need to find another hit beyond the iPod." Jobs also said Apple's online music store iTunes would expand its movie offerings to include selections from Paramount films in addition to titles from Disney. Apple has sold more than 70 million iPods since they were introduced and consumers have bought more than 2 billion songs for about 99 cents each on iTunes. More than 220 television shows are also available on iTunes. Apple shares rose $7.10 to $92.57, having touched $92.98 earlier in the session.
