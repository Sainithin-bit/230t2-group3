 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Shock jock Howard Stern filed with U.S. regulators on Tuesday to register for sale up to 22.1 million shares of Sirius Satellite Radio Inc., his bonus payment after the company ended 2006 with more than 6 million subscribers. 

 Sirius said in the filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that the shares, valued at about $82.9 million, will be sold periodically by Stern's investment vehicle, One Twelve Inc., and by Chipombe LLC, a company whose sole member is Don Buchwald, Stern's agent. Stern joined the satellite radio company one year ago after frequent disputes over government indecency regulations on FM radio.
