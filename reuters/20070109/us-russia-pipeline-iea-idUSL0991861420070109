 MOSCOW  (Reuters) - The International Energy Agency said on Tuesday that European oil markets would cope with the halt to Russian oil exports via Belarus, which has shut down supplies to Poland and Germany. 

 "There is apparently no immediate impact to any of the refineries in the countries involved, as they all have working stocks of several days. So there is no threat that product supplies to the end users will be disrupted," the IEA said in a statement. Russia has accused Belarus of stealing oil from Druzhba, a major pipeline, and has shut off crude exports to its western neighbor, halting supplies to Poland and Germany and threatening wider disruptions in central Europe. Russia's pipeline monopoly Transneft ( TRNF_p.RTS ) said on Monday it was forced to act because Minsk had been siphoning off oil illegally from the Druzhba ('Friendship') pipeline system. "Should disruption from the Druzhba pipeline prove more prolonged, each of the refineries could source crude supplies from alternative routes and some of them are already organizing alternative supplies, be it through ports at the Baltic Sea or through pipelines coming from other sources," the IEA said. The affected member countries of the IEA -- Germany, Hungary and the Czech Republic -- and its two applicant countries in the region -- Poland and Slovakia -- each have strategic reserves which could be drawn upon if the situation warrants, it said. "But reports from the different countries and companies currently indicate that the market is quite capable of handling this situation." The IEA said it wanted a quick and clear resolution to the disruption.
