Verizon (might have to) look out and all the other manufacturers may have some problems. Some of this is already done with phones that link into your computer. It will be interesting to see what the bells and whistles will be." "Shares are where they were when he started talking so it remains to be seen how successful this is. I don't think it will have an affect short-term (revenue) but mid to long term." SHANNON CROSS, ANALYST, SOLEIL-CROSS RESEARCH: The "iPhone should be very compelling." It will cause consumers to "upgrade some of the existing ipods but more importantly, (it will be) compelling competition for smart phones that are out there." "AppleTV video quality looks good at 720p which is HD resolution. At $299, (it's at a) very attractive price point." (Reporting by  Chris Sanders ,  Jim Finkle  and  Michele Gershberg )
