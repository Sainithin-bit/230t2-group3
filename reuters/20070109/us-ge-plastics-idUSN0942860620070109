 NEW YORK/BOSTON  (Reuters) - General Electric Co. ( GE.N ) is at an early stage of discussing options for its plastics business with selected parties which could potentially lead to a sale of the unit, a source familiar with the situation said on Tuesday. 

 Analysts valued the unit at up to $10 billion and said buyers could be private equity players or rivals. GE is the world's second-largest company, with a market value of about $387 billion. Citigroup analyst Jeffrey Sprague named German chemical firm BASF AG BASF.DE, U.S. chemical supplier Dow Chemical Co. ( DOW.N ) and Saudi Arabia's Saudi Basic Industries Corp. 2010.SE, also known as SABIC, as possible buyers. Several analysts said other buyers could include U.S. firms such as Dupont Co. ( DD.N ), Huntsman Corp. ( HUN.N ), Lyondell Chemical Co. LYO.N, Rohm and Haas Co. ROH.N. Foreign purchasers could include Chinese oil and gas producer PetroChina ( 0857.HK ), and India's Reliance Industries  ( RELI.BO ). Private equity firms, which buy and sell companies, have been attracted to the chemical sector in the last few years. Chemical companies have been shedding units, which has played into the hands of cash-rich buyout firms looking to spend money on underperforming or growing businesses. They also generate cash, which buyout firms need to pay down debt borrowed to acquire the companies. Private equity bidders for GE's unit could include Apollo Management, Blackstone Group and Bain Capital, analysts said. All three were involved in the auction for Tyco International Ltd's ( TYC.N ) plastic's division. Apollo agreed to buy that unit for $975 million in cash in December 2005. Blackstone and Apollo are also in the hunt to acquire a similar business from Lyondell. To read this story please click on <ID:nN08378239>. The Wall Street Journal reported that GE has told private-equity firms that they face restrictions on their ability to team up with other private-equity bidders, citing people familiar with the sale effort, and that Goldman Sachs is acting on GE's behalf for the sale. GE and Goldman declined comment. PRICE TAG $10 BLN? The plastics unit, along with NBC Universal media, has been a thorn in GE's side for the past year, posting weak financial performance. While the diversified conglomerate expects NBC to turn the corner this year, GE has warned investors that conditions for the plastics business will remain tough. The business, which makes plastics for automotive parts, computer enclosures, compact disks, telecoms equipment and construction materials, faced margin pressure in 2006 as a result of the rising price of benzene, a key raw material. The unit recorded revenues of $5 billion for the first nine months of 2006 and profits of $560 million, or about 4 percent of the total figures for the company as a whole. Analysts differed in opinion on the price tag. Nigel Coe, equity analyst with Deutsche Bank, wrote that a possible $10 billion price tag would be at the "high end" of possible valuations. But Sprague wrote that he "would not be surprised to see the sale price rise above this level." GE shares slipped 9 cents to $37.46 by early afternoon on the New York Stock Exchange.
