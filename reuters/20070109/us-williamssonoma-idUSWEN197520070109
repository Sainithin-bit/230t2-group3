 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Williams-Sonoma Inc. ( WSM.N ), which operates kitchenware stores and the Pottery Barn home decor stores, on Tuesday affirmed fourth-quarter and full-year earnings forecasts and said sales in the eight weeks that ended December 24 at stores open at least a year rose 1.1 percent. 

 Although the company gave a "cautious" outlook for 2007, and said competitive pressure and the "home-related macroeconomic environment" may keep a lid on profit and revenue growth, shares rose 3.7 percent in early trading. Goldman Sachs analyst Adrianne Shapira said Williams-Sonoma appeared to have set a more "realistic" earnings bar for its next fiscal year. If demand recovers in the second half of the year as Shapira is expecting, "We believe the company would then be in a strong position to reverse trends, posting earnings gains in the back half," she wrote in a research note. Williams-Sonoma's Pottery Barn stores have struggled as less-expensive chains like Restoration Hardware Inc. RSTO.O, Target Corp. ( TGT.N ) and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ( WMT.N ) edge in on its territory, offering similar merchandise at lower prices. While it works to revive Pottery Barn's business, it is also facing pressure from the slowing housing market, which has dampened consumer demand for high-ticket items like furniture. Williams-Sonoma, which lowered its full-year forecast in November, said it expects profit of $1 to $1.06 per share on revenue of $1.23 billion to $1.26 billion for its fiscal fourth quarter that ends in January, and profit of $1.74 to $1.80 per share on revenue of $3.71 billion to $3.74 billion for the full year. Analysts polled by Reuters Estimates on average forecast profit of $1.03 per share on revenue of $1.25 billion for the fourth quarter, and profit of $1.75 per share on revenue of $3.73 billion for the full year. "William-Sonoma's holiday results were at the high end of previously (and dramatically) lowered expectations, implying that the company was able to execute reasonably well in a challenging environment," Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. analyst Colin McGranahan said in a research note. But he said the  "very weak" forecast for its next fiscal year was a concern and could imply that historical margin levels may not be achievable in the changing competitive environment. Chief Executive Howard Lester said the San Francisco-based company overcame a "difficult and highly promotional retail environment" during the holiday season. He expects the markdowns to continue as retailers clear through excess merchandise, and he said margin pressures will remain, particularly in the first half of the year, as it tries to revitalize the Pottery Barn brand. Lester said that in its next fiscal year, Williams-Sonoma expects an unchanged to mid-single-digit percentage increase in earnings per share, and a mid- to high-single-digit increase in net revenue. Williams-Sonoma shares rose $1.17 to $32.45 on the New York Stock Exchange. They have fallen 28 percent in the last year.
