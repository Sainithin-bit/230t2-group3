 LONDON  (Reuters) - The London Stock Exchange stepped up its fight against a hostile bid from Nasdaq Stock Markets Inc. on Tuesday, saying a big jump in earnings and confidence in the future justified its rejection of the bid. 

 The London Stock Exchange, Europe's largest share market, posted a 53 percent rise in adjusted third-quarter earnings, boosted by a rise in trading volumes and the number of companies listing on its markets. Adjusted basic earnings per share were 15 pence in the three months to December 31. Nine-month basic adjusted earnings were also up 53 percent at 39.1 pence a share. "We are confident of an excellent outcome for the current financial year and continuing strong business fundamentals should ensure a strong performance for the next financial year ending March 31, 2008," LSE said in a trading update. "This excellent performance supports the board's rejection of Nasdaq's offer which significantly undervalues the business and the Exchange's unique strategic position," it said. The bid from Nasdaq, which owns just under 30 percent of the LSE, values the London exchange at 2.7 billion pounds ($5.2 billion). Nasdaq said in a statement it urged LSE shareholders to accept its "full and fair" offer. By 1032 GMT shares were unchanged at 1,281 pence a share, above Nasdaq's 1,243 pence offer, reflecting expectations of a raised offer. U.S. investor Samuel Heyman said late on Monday he had increased his stake in the LSE to 9.96 percent. His investment vehicle, Heyman Investment Associates and Vesper Holdings, own derivatives such as options and contracts for difference (CFDs) through which he is exposed to LSE's shares. Nasdaq said on Monday that strong third-quarter figures from LSE would not change its view on the value of the business and that the London exchange faced growing pressure to cut fees as well as competition from a group of investment banks which agreed last year to create a rival trading platform. "The LSE's Q3 trading statement confirms the continuation of strong profit growth across the business but contains no fuel for further upgrades since the earnings guidance provided in the defense document issued on December 19," Bridgewell Securities analysts wrote in a research note. LSE shares have more than trebled over the past two years as it has attracted -- and rejected -- a procession of suitors. The world's stock exchanges are under pressure to consolidate as customers push for global services and lower fees.
