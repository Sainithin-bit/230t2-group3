 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. GT.N said 
on Tuesday that it expects the impact from the nearly 
three-month long United Steelworkers strike in North America to 
linger into the first half of 2007. 

  Goodyear, the largest U.S. tire maker, said lower 
production volume and lost sales cut operating income by about 
$30 million to $35 million per week in the fourth quarter. In 
November Goodyear had used the same rate to describe the impact 
on earnings from the first few weeks of the strike.  About 15,000 hourly workers went on strike October 5 and 
began returning to work January 2 after ratifying a new 
agreement with Goodyear.  Goodyear has said it expects cumulative savings of $610 
million from its new contract with the union over the life of 
the contract and $300 million per year thereafter.  The Akron, Ohio-based tire maker said it would release 
fourth-quarter results and a 2007 outlook in February.  The agreement with the steelworkers allows Goodyear to 
close a unionized tire plant in Texas early in 2008 and 
establishes a trust for union retiree health care that will 
remove that from a negotiating point in future talks.  "Surely we recognize that there were short-term negatives 
from the strike, however on balance the improvements in our 
system far outweigh those negatives," Goodyear Chief Executive 
Robert Keegan told analysts on a conference call.  Goodyear plans at some point to do an equity offering, but 
would look to sell its engineered products business and resolve 
salaried retiree benefits issues and a couple of other things 
first, CFO Rich Kramer said.  The tire maker expects to continue to reduce the number of 
workers it has in North America, but does not plan to offer 
expansive buyouts like the ones seen in the U.S. auto industry, 
Kramer said.  Goodyear shares were up 29 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $24.33 
in early trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
