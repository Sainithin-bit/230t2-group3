 MEXICO CITY  (Reuters) - Latin American stocks tumbled on Tuesday, hit by falling oil and metals prices as well as plans by leftist Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez to nationalize telecom CANTV and major utilities. 

 A drop in oil to its lowest level in 18 months clipped energy stocks in Brazil and Argentina and sent Mexico's peso MEX01  MXN=  to a five-week low of 11.025 per dollar. A 2.34 percent drop in energy giant Petrobras ( PETR4.SA ) helped pull Brazil's Bovespa stock index  .BVSP  down 1.97 percent. Falling copper prices added to a sell-off of more than 12 percent in the metal so far this year, prompting equity investors to take money off the table in resource-rich Latin America. "It's a general reduction in risk, starting with commodities and spilling over into emerging markets. It's oil and metals," said one equities salesman in New York. Chile's Madeco MAD.SN, which produces copper cable, was down 1.08 percent, contributing to a 0.3 percent drop in the country's IPSA .IPSA stock market measure. Plans announced on Monday by Chavez to nationalize Venezuela's largest telecom firm CANTV TDVd.CR VNT.N and unspecified power companies also plagued stock prices in the region. New York-traded shares of CANTV, which is almost 30 percent owned by U.S. telephone giant Verizon ( VZ.N ), plummeted 34 percent. In Caracas, the IBC .IBC benchmark stock index suffered a 19 percent nose-dive as investors bolted for the door. America Movil ( AMXL.MX ), a leading Latin American cellphone operator that had planned to buy a stake in CANTV, slumped 2.53 percent to 23.89 pesos, helping send Mexico's IPC stock index down 1.61 percent. Mexico-based America Movil's New York-traded stock ( AMX.N ) declined 3.11 percent to $43.36. Argentina's Merval stock benchmark  .MERV  lost 2.57 percent. "The Merval's drop is in reaction to Venezuela," Buenos Aires stock trader Dionisio Corneille said, adding that cheaper oil was also taking a toll on some firms. STEPPING IT UP Buoyed by a landslide re-election last month, Chavez said on Monday said he would mold the country into a socialist republic, frightening critics who say the former paratrooper wants to forge a centralized, Cuban-style economy. Venezuela's benchmark dollar-denominated global bond due in 2027 VENGLB27=RR fell 1.625 percentage points to bid 123.375 in price, a six-week low, to yield 7.079 percent. Balmy temperatures in the U.S. Northeast have sharply reduced heating oil demand in the top consuming region, overshadowing other energy news that might have boosted prices. On the London Metal Exchange, three-month copper futures edged lower and some analysts were expecting further falls due to concerns over slowing economic growth, especially in the United States, and rising supply. Latin American resource companies have boomed in recent years thanks in part to heavy demand from fast-growing China for building and manufacturing materials.
