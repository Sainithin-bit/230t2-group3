 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - THQ Inc. THQI.O said an independent 
investigation of its stock options granting practices found no 
evidence of fraud, but the video game maker will record an $11 
million non-cash charge for incorrect measurement dates. 

  A special committee appointed by the board found "no 
evidence of fraud or misconduct," the company said on Tuesday.  It identified instances in which the company "misapplied 
GAAP by using incorrect measurement dates for financial 
accounting and reporting purposes on a number of occasions."  The $11 million after-tax charge covers the period of 
January 1, 1996 to March 31, 2006, THQ said in a statement.  The adjustments, after-tax for fiscal 2007, were immaterial 
and will be reflected in the company's quarterly report for the 
period ended September 30, 2006, THQ said.  For each of the 2006, 2005 and 2004 fiscal years, the 
adjustments were about $2 million and will be reflected in the 
company's amended annual report for the fiscal year ended March 
31, 2006, THQ said.  The information in the reports for the fiscal years 2002 to 
2006 and the quarters in fiscal 2006 and 2005 should no longer 
be relied upon, the company also said.  The committee recommended ways to improve the company's 
procedures for granting and administering stock options, which 
the board adopted and the company is implementing, THQ said.  It also said the company informed the U.S. Securities and 
Exchange Commission of the committee's findings and is 
continuing to work with the SEC.  THQ expects to file its March 31, 2006 10-K/A and its 
September 30, 2006 10-Q with the SEC by January 19. Once it 
makes those filings, it believes it will regain compliance with 
the Nasdaq stock market's listing requirements, the company 
said.
