  (Adds analyst comment, Citigroup stock price) 

  By Jonathan Stempel and  Edwina Gibbs WASHINGTON/TOKYO  Jan 9 (Reuters) - Citigroup Inc. ( C.N )
will close most of its Japanese consumer finance branches and
suffer a $370 million fourth-quarter loss in that unit, hit by
law changes that cut the maximum interest rates on loans.  The largest U.S. bank will take a $40 million
fourth-quarter charge, including costs to close 270 out of 320
branches and 100 of 800 automated loan machines.  Citigroup will also increase reserves by $375 million, as
Japanese personal-loan firms face a flood of demands to repay
interest charges that courts have deemed illegal. The bank's
shares fell as much as 1.1 percent on Tuesday.  "We were surprised by the magnitude of the branch closings
and negative impact on 2007 earnings," wrote Jeff Harte, a
Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP analyst.  The expected fourth-quarter net loss for the unit is equal
to 7 cents per share, Citigroup said. It expects the Japanese
consumer finance unit to roughly break even in 2007 and
thereafter be profitable as costs decline.  Amid a public and political backlash against the industry,
changes in Japanese law have cut the maximum allowable interest
charge on loans to 15 percent to 20 percent, depending on the
type of loan, from 29.2 percent.  The industry was also battered by a Supreme Court ruling
that said charges on loans with rates between 20 percent and 29
percent, a gray zone between two conflicting usury laws, are
illegal. The ruling forced many lenders to beef up reserves.  "The likelihood of Citigroup selling its consumer finance
business has increased, though that will depend on how well
they restructure the business," said Nomura Securities analyst
Shinichi Iimura.  Citigroup Chief Executive Charles Prince has been under
pressure from many investors and analysts to lower Citigroup's
expenses and to increase revenue faster than costs.  LOWER PROFITS  The Citigroup business, which operates under the brand name
DIC, ranks around fifth or sixth in Japanese consumer finance.  It started closing branches in the second half of 2006 and
plans to finish in the next few months, spokeswoman Atsuko
Yoshitsugu said.  Profit from the consumer finance business tumbled 70
percent to $37 million in the third quarter, while revenue
slipped 4 percent to $587 million.  Japan's top four money lenders -- Acom Co. Ltd. ( 8572.T ),
Takefuji Corp. 8564.T, Promise Co. 8574.T and Aiful Corp.
( 8515.T ) -- posted a combined 765 billion yen loss for the
first half and see full-year losses at 706 billion yen.  Customers at lower-ranked companies have often been turned
down at the top three firms. This puts those lower-ranked
companies, which include General Electric Co.'s ( GE.N ) Lake
business, under even more pressure than rivals to restructure.  "GE could do the same thing as Citigroup, though its home
loan and other retail finance business is now growing," Iimura
said.  In 2004, Japanese regulators revoked Citigroup's private
banking license, citing a breakdown in internal controls.  The bank is scheduled to report fourth-quarter results on
Jan. 19. Analysts polled by Reuters Estimates had projected
profit of $1.07 per share.  Citigroup shares were down 44 cents to $54.61 in morning
trading on the New York Stock Exchange, after earlier falling
to $54.43.  Shares in Japanese consumer firms rose on Tuesday, with
Acom ending up 2.5 percent at 4,500 yen, Takefuji rising 3.5
percent to 5,270 yen and Aiful climbing 2.7 percent to 3,820
yen.  Market participants said bargain hunters may have been
behind the rise. The sector was the worst performer in 2006,
sliding 30.4 percent.
