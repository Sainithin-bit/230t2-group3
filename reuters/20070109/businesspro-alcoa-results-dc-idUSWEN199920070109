 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Alcoa Inc. ( AA.N ) said on Tuesday that 
fourth-quarter profit rose as a result of high metal prices and 
strong demand from aerospace, commercial transportation and 
building markets. 

  Net earnings were $359 million, or 41 cents per share, 
compared with $224 million, or 26 cents per share in the same 
quarter of 2005, the Pittsburgh-based company said.  Income from continuing operations was $644 million, or 74 
cents per share, excluding restructuring and impairment 
charges.  Alcoa, the world's largest aluminum producer, said revenue 
in the quarter rose 20 percent to $7.8 billion.
