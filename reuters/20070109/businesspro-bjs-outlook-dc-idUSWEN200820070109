 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - BJ's Wholesale Club Inc. BJ.N, 
the No. 3 warehouse club operator, said on Tuesday it would 
close its 46 in-store pharmacies and two ProFoods restaurant 
supply clubs as part of a broader restructuring. 

  Those operations will be closed by the end of the quarter 
ending February 3, the company said.  The company estimated that reserves related to the closures 
will be about $41 million, before taxes.
