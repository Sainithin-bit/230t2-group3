 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The U.S. Congress should repeal a law authorizing the Internal Revenue Service to use private debt collectors to bring in delinquent federal tax debts because the practice is inefficient, the agency's internal taxpayer advocacy group said on Tuesday. 

 In her annual report to Congress, IRS National Taxpayer Advocate Nina Olson said that after two years of monitoring the IRS' private debt collection initiative, "the IRS now acknowledges that it can collect these delinquent accounts more efficiently than PCAs (private collection agencies)". The Taxpayer Advocate Service has observed a significant amount of complexity in cases assigned to private collectors for which their employees are not adequately trained. "Unlike other federal agencies, the IRS has a nearly $2 billion collection budget with thousands of collection employees," the report said. "In contrast, PCAs ... are using 75 employees to collect on these accounts, and the IRS is using 65 employees to monitor them. The IRS with its vast resources can do what 75 PCA employees can do." The group said the IRS initiative carries hidden costs that can harm IRS transparency and consistent treatment for similarly situated taxpayers and the IRS' goal of long-term tax compliance. These include poor customer service for multilingual taxpayers, collection agency plans being withheld from public disclosure and collection agency telephone scripts "through which PCA employees attempt to manipulate taxpayers." "The impact to tax compliance is uncertain. However, the National Taxpayer Advocate believes the IRS has risked much for a small return, if any, on its investment," the report said.
