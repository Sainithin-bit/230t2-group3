 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The Nasdaq rose on Tuesday as Apple Computer Inc. ( AAPL.O ) unveiled a hotly anticipated mobile phone and boosted optimism about the tech sector, while blue-chip stocks slipped as lower oil prices hit energy shares. 

 Apple unveiled a mobile phone with a touch-screen that combines features from its iPod music player, sending its shares up 8.3 percent. "There is a lot of enthusiasm over Apple," said Tim Woolston, portfolio manager at Boston Advisors Inc. in Boston. Also, "you've got a lot of folks suggesting that '07 will be a good year for tech earnings because of capital expenditure budgets." After the close, shares of aluminum producer Alcoa Inc. ( AA.N ) jumped 4.4 percent as it reported earnings that beat expectations.  The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  fell 6.89 points, or 0.06 percent, to end at 12,416.60. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  was down 0.72 points, or 0.05 percent, at 1,412.12. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  was up 5.63 points, or 0.23 percent, at 2,443.83. Alcoa, the first Dow component to report fourth-quarter results, rose to $29.77 in electronic trade from a close of $28.52 in regular New York Stock Exchange trade. During the regular session, shares of major energy companies including ConocoPhillips ( COP.N ) and Exxon Mobil Corp. ( XOM.N ) declined after oil prices fell to their lowest in 18 months. A profit warning by Sprint Nextel Corp. ( S.N ), which sparked concern about the outlook for earnings gains just as the quarterly reporting season gets under way, also kept a lid on the broader market. Shares of Sprint, the top drag on the S&P 500 index, tumbled 11.2 percent, or $2.19, to $17.45. The No. 3 U.S. mobile service provider said late on Monday that profit in 2007 will remain under pressure due to lower margins and revenue will be flat or slightly higher. Apple's stock, which rose $7.10 to $92.57, was the biggest positive influence on the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 index. Shares of AT&T ( T.N ), whose Cingular Wireless unit is Apple's U.S. cellular partner for the new iPhone, also rose, gaining 0.4 percent, or 13 cents, to $33.94. Shares of U.S. power company AES Corp. ( AES.N ) dropped 4.1 percent, or 86 cents, to $20.16 after Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez said he would seek to nationalize utilities and telecommunication companies. The announcement also created a sell-off in Latin American shares. Although Chavez did not specify which electricity companies would be nationalized, AES's Electricidad de Caracas EDC.CR, or EDC, is the largest privately owned utility in Venezuela.  On the New York Mercantile Exchange, February crude CLG7 fell 45 cents, or 0.8 percent, to settle at $55.64 a barrel, after trading as low as $53.88 earlier. A warm winter in the U.S. Northeast, the key heating oil market, pressured oil prices along with ample crude and fuel supplies. The day's low was the weakest front-month crude price since $53.05 was hit on June 13, 2005. Shares of Exxon Mobil fell 0.8 percent, or 56 cents, to $72.09, while shares of ConocoPhillips declined 2.6 percent, or $1.79, to $66.51. Trading was active on the NYSE, with about 1.71 billion shares changing hands, below last year's estimated daily average of 1.84 billion, while on Nasdaq, about 2.19 billion shares traded, above last year's daily average of 2.02 billion. Advancing stocks outnumbered declining ones by a ratio of about 9 to 7 on the NYSE, while decliners outnumbers advancers by 15 to 14 on Nasdaq.
