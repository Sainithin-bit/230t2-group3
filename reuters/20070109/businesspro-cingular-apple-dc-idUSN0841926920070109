 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - AT&T's ( T.N ) mobile phone unit, 
Cingular Wireless, is expected to provide a service for a phone 
from Apple Computer Inc.( AAPL.O ), the Wall Street Journal 
reported on Monday, citing people familiar with the matter. 

  An announcement could come as soon as Tuesday, the 
newspaper said on its Web site.  Apple Chief Executive Steve Jobs speaks on Tuesday at the 
Macworld expo, the company's main annual showcase for new 
products, and this year's Macworld address has long been seen 
as a likely kick-off for a phone based on Apple's iPod music 
player.  Apple watchers had seen Cingular as a top candidate for an 
iPod phone deal. Some Cingular phones already work with Apple's 
iTunes music service.  An Apple spokesman declined to comment and a Cingular 
spokesman was not immediately available.
