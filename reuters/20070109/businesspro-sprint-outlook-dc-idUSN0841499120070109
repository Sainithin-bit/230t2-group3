 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Sprint Nextel Corp. said on Monday 
revenue will be flat or slightly higher in 2007 and profit will 
remain under pressure due to lower margins, sending its shares 
down 8 percent. 

  The No. 3 U.S. mobile service provider also said it would 
cut 5,000 jobs, or nearly 8 percent of its work force, to 
reduce costs and further integrate Nextel, which it bought in 
August 2005.  Sprint said it added 742,000 total net subscribers in the 
fourth quarter, ending 2006 with a customer base of 53.1 
million. It lost 306,000 post-paid customers in the quarter, 
with its churn rate, or cancellation rate, at 2.3 percent.  Stanford Group analyst Michael Nelson said the 
fourth-quarter numbers were disappointing and that while 
management's admission of its problems was positive, investors 
likely wanted to see results.  "Guidance was disappointing. And at this point, Sprint has 
become a 'show me' story," he said.  Sprint shares, which have fallen about 17 percent in the 
past 12 months amid investor concerns over falling market share 
and network problems, tumbled to $18 in after-hours trading 
from the New York Stock Exchange close of $19.64.  "In the near term, a lower margin revenue mix, investment 
of an additional $1.1 billion in our business operations and 
start-up costs associated with the build-out of our fourth 
generation WiMAX wireless network will pressure profitability," 
said Sprint Chairman and CEO Gary Forsee said in a statement.  "We will continue to adjust our cost structure, which will 
include a work force reduction, as we meet the changing demands 
of the business."  Sprint forecast consolidated operating revenues of around 
$41 billion to $42 billion for 2007. That compared with Wall 
Street analysts' average forecast of $41.8 billion, according 
to Reuters Estimates.  The company also reiterated its 2006 consolidated operating 
revenue of about $41 billion and forecast annual capital 
expenditure of about $7.0 billion to $7.3 billion.  For 2007, the company forecast capital spending of around 
$8.5 billion, consisting of $7.1 billion for core wireless 
networks and spectrum rebanding efforts, adding that it aimed 
to add network coverage and capacity.  Sprint suffered from network problems in 2006, and Forsee 
acknowledged that issues with its iDEN network had hurt demand 
and increased churn.  The company said its full-time head count reduction would 
be applied across the company, from a base of 64,600 at the end 
of 2006, with a majority of the cuts planned in the first 
quarter.  It forecast a total of around $700 million in merger 
integration and severance costs in 2007, with the bulk of those 
costs in the first half of the year.  Sprint also said it was on course to achieve $14.5 billion 
in net merger synergies.  Chief Financial Officer Paul Saleh said the cost synergies, 
as well as its stricter policy to attract more higher-credit 
customers, would eventually pay off and lead to stronger 
results in 2008.  "We're guiding for positive trends in 2008. We expect 
positive subscriber growth in 2007, with an acceleration into 
2008," he said in a phone interview.  Sprint said revenue growth in 2007 would be offset by lower 
average revenue per subscriber and lower wireline revenue.  It expects to continue with its share buyback program, but 
the amount and timing of its purchases will vary as the program 
proceeds.  Since the start of the program in August 2006, the company 
has repurchased 98 million shares for about $1.6 billion.
