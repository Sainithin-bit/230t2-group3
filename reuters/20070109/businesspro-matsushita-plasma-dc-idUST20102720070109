 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. Ltd. 
( 6752.T ) will spend about 280 billion yen ($2.36 billion) to 
build the world's largest plasma display factory in western 
Japan, the Nikkei newspaper reported on Wednesday. 

  Matsushita, the world's largest maker of plasma display 
televisions, will aim to begin production at the factory in the 
summer of 2008 and eventually ramp up to an annual output 
capacity of 10 million units, the newspaper said.  The maker of Panasonic products will announce plans for the 
plant as early as Wednesday, Nikkei said, without quoting 
sources.  Matsushita is scheduled to hold a news conference in Tokyo 
in the afternoon to unveil a new three-year business plan.  Matsushita currently has four plasma display factories in 
operation with a fifth due to come on line this summer, 
boosting its overall annual production capacity to the 
equivalent of 11.5 million 42-inch panels.  It will likely close two older factories in Osaka as the 
new factory in Hyogo comes on-line, eliminating about 3 million 
units of capacity. With the new factory, its overall capacity 
should therefore come to about 18 million units a year, the 
Nikkei said.  Matsushita could not immediately be reached for comment.  Matsushita's competitors in the plasma TV market include 
Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd. ( 005930.KS ), LG Electronics Inc. 
( 066570.KS ), and Pioneer Corp. ( 6773.T )
