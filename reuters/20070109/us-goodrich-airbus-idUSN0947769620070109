 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. aerospace component company Goodrich Corp. GR.N said on Tuesday it won a contract to sell nacelle and thrust reverser systems to EADS ( EAD.PA ) unit Airbus for all variants of the European planemaker's recently launched A350 XWB aircraft. 

 Goodrich, the leading U.S. maker of landing gear, brakes and engine control systems, said the contract will generate about $10 billion in equipment, service and spare part revenues over 20 years. The Charlotte, North Carolina-based company is expected to report $5.8 billion revenue for 2006. Its shares rose 22 cents, or 0.5 percent, to $46.07 on the New York Stock Exchange. The U.S. company is also making nacelles -- the structure surrounding the jet engine -- for Boeing Co.'s ( BA.N ) 787 Dreamliner, the main competitor for Airbus' new A350. Goodrich is also making the landing gear for Airbus' A380 superjumbo. Goodrich's main competitor in this market is Aircelle, part of French group Safran ( SAF.PA ), which is Europe's leading nacelle manufacturer. The U.S. company is one of the first major suppliers to be named to the A350 XWB (extra wide body) program. Airbus' long-awaited mid-sized jet got final management approval in December after an earlier version flopped in competition with Boeing's 787. (Additional reporting by  Jason Neely  in London)
