 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Lockheed Martin Corp. ( LMT.N ) won a 
$655 million modification to a previously awarded contract for 
production of Trident II (D5) missiles and for support for 
already deployed Trident I and II missiles, the U.S. Navy said 
on Tuesday. 

  It said work on the contract would run through September 
2010.  The weapons are ballistic missiles armed with nuclear 
warheads and launched from nuclear-powered submarines.
