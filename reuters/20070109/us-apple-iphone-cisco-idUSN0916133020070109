 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Cisco Systems Inc. said on Tuesday it expected to reach an agreement with Apple Computer Inc. later Tuesday on its "iPhone" trademark after Apple unveiled a mobile phone with the same name. 

 Cisco spokeswoman Penny Bruce said the two companies had been in discussions, and it believed that Apple intends to agree to a final document and public statement concerning the trademark. "We expect to receive a signed agreement today," she said. Linksys, a division of Cisco, has launched several wireless products with the iPhone name.
