 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Bankrupt Northwest Airlines Corp. 
NWACQ.PK intends to file its plan of reorganization with a 
U.S. bankruptcy court by early next week, a Northwest spokesman 
said on Tuesday. 

  The airline, which has been operating under bankruptcy 
protection since September 2005, has until January 16 to 
exclusively file a plan of reorganization (POR) with the court.  "We plan to file our POR by January 16," Northwest 
spokesman Bill Mellon said.  The No. 5 U.S. carrier has said it plans to come out of 
bankruptcy in the first half of this year. The carrier entered 
bankruptcy with plans to slash costs by $2.5 billion a year.  Northwest has suffered along with the rest of the industry 
under the weight of soaring fuel costs and low-fare 
competition.  Northwest declined to comment on objections filed in 
bankruptcy court to Northwest's proposed buyout of bankrupt 
regional carrier Mesaba Airlines, a unit of MAIR Holdings  MAIR.O.  Two MAIR shareholders -- Riley Investment Partners Master 
Fund and Thales Fund Management -- on Monday filed objections 
with Mesaba's bankruptcy court in Minneapolis, claiming 
Northwest's bid is below fair market value.  The shareholders said Mesaba was not marketed to other 
potential bidders and that Northwest "now seeks to fast-track 
an insider buyout of Mesaba at a bargain basement price."  A Mesaba spokeswoman was not immediately available for 
comment.
