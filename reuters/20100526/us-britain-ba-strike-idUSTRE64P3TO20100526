 LONDON  (Reuters) - British Airways said it would resume talks with the union of striking cabin crew later on Wednesday in an attempt to avert further industrial action. 

 Cabin attendants are in the third day of a five-day strike, protesting over staffing levels and cuts to benefits. The stoppage follows seven days of walkouts in March. Previous negotiations in the long-running dispute have been acrimonious. The last round of talks ended in chaos over the weekend when left-wing protesters stormed the negotiations. "I really hope we can pick up the momentum of the talks from where we were on Saturday before we were invaded," Tony Woodley, joint general secretary of the Unite union, told the BBC. He said Saturday's meeting was the first time that he felt that was a genuine will to work toward a settlement. Unite, which represents the bulk of the airline's cabin crew, has threatened another 10 days of strikes if the dispute is not resolved. BA said it was upping the number of flights it plans to run during the next wave of strikes, from May 30 to June 3, after more staff than expected decided to work during this week's industrial action. The airline said its Heathrow longhaul schedule would be increased to more than 70 percent of flights, from 60 percent this week, while the shorthaul schedule would rise to 55 percent of flights, from 50 percent. Woodley repeated his offer to postpone the strikes if travel allowances for cabin crew, which have become a major sticking point in the conflict, are reinstated. "Put the travel back as a gesture, and we will postpone the strike to finalize any other discussion," he said. (Reporting by  Avril Ormsby  and  Kylie MacLellan ; Editing by David Cowell)
