 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Apple Inc ( AAPL.O ) briefly became the largest tech company in the world by market capitalization on Wednesday, after surpassing Microsoft Corp's ( MSFT.O ) market value, according to Reuters data. 

 Apple's live market cap rose above $227 billion to overtake Microsoft's and made it the second-largest company on the S&P 500 index. The top spot is held by energy behemoth Exxon Mobil Corp ( XOM.N ). (Editing by Theodore d'Afflisio)
