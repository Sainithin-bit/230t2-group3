 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Standard & Poor's 500 index futures opened the week on a slightly firmer footing after Wall Street's latest drubbing on Friday, edging about 2 points higher as trading got underway in Asia's Monday morning session. 

 It marked a relatively subdued start to the trading week, particularly with the drama surrounding the end of last week when U.S. stock futures trading was halted as benchmark contracts fell to their "limit down" thresholds. The S&P 500's front-month contract dipped in the first moments of trading but has since bounced back to just above break-even. Wall Street indexes ended Friday at 5-1/2 year lows.
