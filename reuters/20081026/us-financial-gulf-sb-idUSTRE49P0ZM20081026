 KUWAIT  (Reuters) - Kuwait moved to prop up one of its banks and Saudi Arabia extended $2.7 billion in credit to needy citizens on Sunday as the global financial crisis spread to the Gulf Arab region, sending stocks into a tailspin. 

 The Kuwait central bank was forced to step in to support Gulf Bank, which was hit by derivatives trading losses, prompting the government to announce it would guarantee deposits at local banks. Saudi Arabia unveiled plans to deposit 10 billion riyals ($2.67 billion) into the Saudi Credit Bank, which was established to extend interest-free loans to low-income citizens to help them overcome financial difficulties. The actions lit a fuse to simmering investor concerns about the impact of the global credit crunch on the region. Gulf markets tumbled to multi-month lows on Sunday. Both the Qatar and Oman indices fell more than 8 percent, while Dubai sank 5.53 percent and Saudi Arabia's index slipped 1.83 percent after an 8.7 percent slide on Saturday. The losses followed those on global markets on Friday as investors dumped risky assets. "WORRIED ABOUT MONEY" The latest moves by Kuwait and Saudi Arabia come after an emergency meeting of Gulf finance ministers and central bankers in the Saudi capital on Saturday, which was aimed at better coordinating the region's response to the global downturn. Gulf Arab nations have so far adopted separate policy responses to the crisis, which has frozen interbank lending and panicked investors. Some Gulf states have guaranteed bank deposits, eased lending restrictions and invested in ailing stocks. "People are worried about their money," Mohammed Yasin, managing director of Dubai-based Shuaa Securities, said. "A lot of investors had exposure to U.S. markets through investment funds and those got wiped out. You need to give them security that their money is safe in the banks. "The whole GCC should guarantee deposits. That is the basis from which investors can move forward and start investing." The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) consists of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain and Oman. Adding to the negative sentiment, oil prices dropped nearly $4 a barrel in New York on Friday, despite an OPEC agreement to cut output by 1.5 million barrels a day, amid concerns about a global recession and slowing fuel demand. In the oil-rich Gulf, investors fretted that falling crude prices and an economic downturn would take a heavy toll on growth in the region, which has been booming on the back of a five-fold increase in oil prices since 2002. "Sentiment is so negative that fundamentals are totally being ignored," said Shakeel Sarwar, head of asset management at Bahraini investment bank SICO. "The focus is purely on what's happening on the international markets. "The fundamentals of the region have deteriorated over the past two to three months as oil prices decreased. But oil prices above $50 are still comfortable for the region to finance infrastructure projects." GULF BANK PROBLEMS Gulf Bank had suffered two straight quarters of falling profit due to bad debt charges and the impact of weak markets on its investment portfolio. On Sunday, the central bank halted trading in the lender's shares and appointed a supervisor to oversee its treasury, foreign exchange and financial markets trading operations. The central bank, which also launched an investigation into the bank, said its stock would remain suspended until the probe is completed. Gulf Bank declined to comment on Sunday but National Bank of Kuwait, the country's largest lender, said the losses were widely estimated to amount to up to $743 million. "I think the regional banking sector is in reasonably good shape," SICO's Sarwar said. "They have some exposures here and there to toxic securities but the overall health of the financial sector is intact." (Additional reporting by Lin Noueihed and Daliah Merzaban in Dubai)
