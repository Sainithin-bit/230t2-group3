 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The more than $4 trillion that governments have thrown at the financial crisis pales in comparison with the wealth destroyed in falling stock markets, and conditions may get worse as economic reality sets in. 

 While there are some encouraging signs that efforts to revive credit markets are beginning to gain traction and lending is slowly resuming, companies are sounding the alarm over the damage already done to their profits. Japan's Sony ( 6758.T ) is finding fewer buyers for its cameras and televisions. French carmaker PSA Peugeot Citroen ( PEUP.PA ) is planning "massive" production cuts as demand fades. Online retailer Amazon.com ( AMZN.O ) is warning that holiday sales won't be as strong as expected. The sheer volume of companies reporting disappointing earnings is as distressing as the breadth of industries and countries affected. "We are now in the midst of a full-blown global financial crisis," said Citigroup analyst Robert Buckland. "Policy-makers have been unable to calm the storm, although the increasingly aggressive response offers some hope. The earnings downturn looks to have much further to go." In the five weeks since investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed, stock markets have fallen so sharply that they have wiped out $12 trillion in wealth, according to Citigroup. Consumer and business confidence has also nose-dived since then, and spending has fallen sharply. That will no doubt weigh heavily in the Federal Reserve's decision on Wednesday on whether to cut short-term borrowing costs. Investors widely expect another half-point reduction, which would take the benchmark federal funds rate to 1 percent. When the credit crisis first spiked in August 2007, the rate stood at 5.25 percent. MARKETS THAW; PROFITS FREEZE There is some evidence that the Fed and its fellow central bankers are having some success in easing the credit market strains that drove up borrowing costs and effectively barred many healthy borrowers from accessing cash. Interbank lending rates have begun to ease and bank borrowings from the Fed slipped last week for the first time since Lehman's collapse. If those trends continue, it would go a long way toward fostering a quicker economic recovery. However, the short-term damage is already done. A report due on Thursday is expected to show that the U.S. economy contracted at a 0.5 percent annual pace in the third quarter, according to a Reuters poll. JPMorgan economist Bruce Kasman thinks things may get much worse from there. He is predicting that GDP will decline at a 4 percent clip in the fourth quarter, which would be the worst since 1982. Wall Street analysts have yet to reflect the gloomy outlook in their fourth-quarter corporate earnings forecasts. They are still looking for companies in the Standard & Poor's 500 index to turn in 35 percent profit growth in the current period, according to Thomson Reuters research. While that forecast has come down considerably since April, when analysts were predicting a 64 percent jump, it still seems wildly optimistic considering that earnings have fallen for five straight quarters through September and economic prospects have dimmed considerably since then. That points to more earnings disappointments to come, particularly if the world economy continues to wobble. Analysts have somewhat more realistic expectations for 2009, with earnings growth for the S&P 500 estimated at 19 percent as of Friday. That was already down sharply since October 1, when the growth forecast was 29 percent. CHICKEN LEGS As the earnings picture darkens, companies are responding by cutting spending and jobs, which deepens consumer gloom and creates a vicious circle that is difficult to break. Those circles are now circumnavigating the globe. Consider U.S.-based poultry producer Sanderson Farms ( SAFM.O ). Its best customer for chicken legs is Russia, but sales are falling because Russia is getting a lower price for its oil and its access to credit is drying up. That could translate into weaker profits at Sanderson, which would exacerbate the U.S. economic slowdown and in turn drive oil prices lower and weaken exporters like Russia. With the United States and Europe in or near recession, Russia and its fellow emerging market heavyweights are even more critical to the health of the global economy. "For the past few decades, U.S. consumers have driven global growth, but they are tapped out and likely to stay in balance sheet repair mode," said Benjamin Reitzes, an economist with BMO Capital Markets. "The story is similar in the U.K. and Europe. The next cycle of growth must come from emerging markets, as many have vast pools of untapped consumers." Until that next cycle starts, corporate profits may hold quite a few more unpleasant shocks for stock markets. (Additional reporting by  Bob Burgdorfer  in Chicago; Editing by Dan Grebler)
