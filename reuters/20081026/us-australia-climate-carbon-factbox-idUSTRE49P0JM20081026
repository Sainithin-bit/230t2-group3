 (Reuters) - Australia is in the final stages of putting together a carbon Emissions Trading System expected to be among the world's most comprehensive. It is already the world's fourth largest carbon polluter per capita. 

 The government says around 1,000 of Australia's biggest polluters will need to buy permits under an ETS, to be introduced by 2010, but it has not yet listed the names of these firms. Here is a sector-by-sector list of some of the blue-chip companies that may be affected by the new scheme.* -- Coca-Cola Amatil -- Foster's Group -- Goodman Fielder -- Lion Nathan ENERGY: -- Caltex Australia -- Contact Energy -- Origin Energy (electricity, LPG, natural gas, appliances) -- Orica -- Santos (oil and gas exploration) -- Woodside Petroleum (petroleum exploration and production) MINING: -- Alumina -- BHP Billiton -- Oxiana -- Newcrest Mining -- Rio Tinto OTHER: -- AGL Energy (utilities, gas, electricity) -- Amcor (packaging) -- Boral (building materials) -- Orica (mining, consumer products, chemicals) -- Leighton Holdings (engineering development, contracting group) -- Qantas Airways -- Wesfarmers (retail conglomerate) -- Woolworths (supermarkets) STEEL/Aluminum/BUILDING: -- BlueScope Steel -- OneSteel -- Alumina -- Boral * These companies' exact carbon emissions are not known, but they all volunteered emissions data to the Carbon Disclosure Project. Several were also named by Citigroup as at risk because they have the highest operational exposure to carbon pricing.
