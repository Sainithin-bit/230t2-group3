 LONDON  (Reuters) - The infrastructure fund of Citigroup ( C.N ) and the Vancouver Airports Authority are planning a joint 2 billion pounds ($3.2 billion) bid for Gatwick Airport, The Sunday Times reported without citing sources. 

 Operator BAA put the London airport up for sale after Britain's Competition Commission said in a provisional ruling in August that the unit of Spain's Ferrovial ( FER.MC ) must sell three of its seven UK airports. A string of potential bidders, including airline Virgin Atlantic VA.UL, German builder Hochtief ( HOTG.DE ), Frankfurt airport operator Fraport ( FRAG.DE ), Deutsche Bank's ( DBKGn.DE ) infrastructure arm RREEF and Manchester Airports Group, have already expressed an interest. BAA declined to comment on the report. Citigroup was not available for comment. (Reporting by  Paul Sandle ; editing by Sue Thomas)
