 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp results beat forecasts as business demand for its Office software held up well. 

 Commentary: COLIN GILLIS, ANALYST, BGC FINANCIAL "It's an excellent end to a record year for the company. This is a year full of all kinds of records, with Windows 7 being the best-selling windows ever and the Kinect being the fastest-selling consumer electronics device. "What you're really seeing is excellent cost controls. These are great results given a slower PC environment and it highlights how the company has multiple revenue streams. The $17 billion unearned revenue, which is a forward indicator of business, shows they signed a lot of deals this quarter."
