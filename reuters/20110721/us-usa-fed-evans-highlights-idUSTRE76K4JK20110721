 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - The following are highlights of Chicago Federal Reserve Bank President Charles Evans' comments on the economy and monetary policy on Thursday. 

 ON NEED FOR MORE EASING: "If the funds rate were positive, I would clearly be thinking that more policy accommodation would be appropriate. If we had standard, traditional monetary policy tools available to us, if it were possible to cut the funds rate by a substantial amount, I would be seriously advocating for more accommodating on that basis. "There continues to be considerable scope for the strong accommodation we have in place. That's what we have in place. Like I say, if it were easy to do, if we had a very effective policy tool like a positive funds rate, if we could cut that by 100 basis points, then I would almost surely be advocating something like that. But in the absence of that, I think we have to think about the other tools." ON THE FED'S EASING TOOLS "We've used our best tools first. Not surprisingly, the tools that you use afterward are not quite as good." "I think we have options which are somewhat less attractive. I think in the current environment, one of the options that the Chairman mentioned in his testimony is that there could more forward guidance on how long the policy accommodation could be put in place... "I think there's an added benefit to the economy when you reduce the uncertainty, policy uncertainty, and risk-takers actually know that is the most likely event. "One would be to set a date, you set a date in the future, and you sort of tie your hands to that. Another would be to sort of indicate a date, but also some other alternative objective measures which when you hit that would be a signal that you would be contemplating exiting from that particular specification. Price level targeting, of the form that I was talking about, would be one way to do that "In the situation where I think that it is appropriate and possible to embark on more appropriate monetary policies, I would be willing to support most any policy that arguably was going to be effective and more accommodative." ON THE IMPORTANCE OF DATA THIS QUARTER: "If we continue to have weakness in the third quarter, it's going to be harder to plausibly sustain this idea that, 'oh well, the next six months, it's going to get better. We've been saying this for quite some time. "If anything, I think inflationary pressures are a little below our objective. And on the real side of the economy, we are not performing as well as we could . "I think the third quarter is going to be really key." ON RECENT RISE IN INFLATION "That is a doubling of the inflation rate, but if the target is two percent, it's still underperforming. When the gas tank is empty and you are on a long trip and you stop and you only fill it up half way, you've really increased the amount of gas substantially, but you are going to have to stop again because you didn't put enough gas in the tank." "Inflationary pressures are stronger than what they were last year, and the policy tradeoffs are in fact less attractive than they were a year ago. "However I feel very strongly that when we say 'our inflation objective' - you name a number but I'll say 2 percent - that should be an average. It's not a ceiling. And the idea that as soon as I get to 1.9 percent, that's really a problem I need to do something about that... We have to become comfortable with the idea that we ought to average 2 percent, because if 2 percent is ceiling, that number is too low." (Reporting by  Ann Saphir , Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)
