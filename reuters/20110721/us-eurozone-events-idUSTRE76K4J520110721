The dates are as follows: -- September 4 - Mecklenburg-Vorpommern -- September 18 - Berlin -- Leaders of Merkel's ruling coalition have reached a political agreement to cut taxes from 2013. -- In October the government will present updated economic forecasts that will serve as the basis for semi-annual tax estimates published by a government panel the following month. Based on the amount of fiscal leeway, Merkel plans to unveil the size of her tax cut plan in November before the lower house approves the budget for 2012. -- Since even center-right state governments like Thueringia have signaled their opposition to cuts in income tax and polls show that Germans are overwhelmingly opposed to cuts, any measures could easily be blocked by the Bundesrat. This could result in either a successful arbitration between the two houses, possibly involving the financing of cuts through a new wealth tax. Merkel's coalition could also resort to cuts in the "solidarity charge," set up to improve life in the former East Germany, which would benefit all taxpayers, including the rich. CONSTITUTIONAL COURT: -- Germany's constitutional court in Karlsruhe is due to give a ruling this year on the aid package for Greece and the euro zone rescue mechanism agreed last year. A hearing was held on July 5 and there is no date for a ruling but Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble says it should come by end-September.
