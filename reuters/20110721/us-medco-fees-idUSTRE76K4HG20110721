 PHILADELPHIA  (Reuters) - The financial advisers on Express Scripts Inc's $29.1 billion acquisition of Medco Health Solutions Inc are poised for a rich payday of up to $120 million in total fees. 

 Medco's lead financial advisers, JPMorgan Chase & Co and Lazard Ltd, are likely to split $55 million to $65 million in fees, according to Thomson Reuters and Freeman Consulting. JPMorgan's team included Kevin Willsey, Ravi Sachdev, Jim Woolery and Tom Monaghan, the bank said. Lazard's team included Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Jacobs and David Gluckman. Meanwhile, Express Scripts' financial advisers, Credit Suisse and Citigroup Inc, are likely to split $50 million to $55 million in fees. Credit Suisse's advisory team included Global Head of M&A Boon Sim, as well as Stuart Smith, Michael Muntner, and David Kostel, the firm said. Citigroup's team included global head of M&A Mark Shafir, as well as Christopher Hite, Barry Blake and Ray Cooper, the bank said. The deal would create a U.S. powerhouse in managing prescription drug benefits, giving Express Scripts even more leverage for negotiating drug prices for its corporate clients, which have made it a priority to reduce their exposure to spiraling healthcare costs. The deal would give them greater clout against drugstore chains like Walgreen Co and increase competition with the likes of CVS Caremark Corp. Express Scripts' legal adviser was Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP. Skadden partners on the deal included Lou Kling, Howard Ellin, Kenneth Wolff and Clifford Aronson, the law firm said. Medco's legal adviser was Sullivan & Cromwell LLP. Partners on the deal included James Morphy, Matthew Hurd, Matthew Friestedt, Neal McKnight and Ron Creamer. Medco's regulatory counsel was Dechert LLP. (Reporting by  Jessica Hall , additional reporting by Paritosh Bansal; editing by Gerald E. McCormick,  Tim Dobbyn  and Lisa Von Ahn)
