-- One more reason to fix euro crisis: it's holiday time

 PARIS  (Reuters) - Europe's leaders had more reason to find a fix to the euro zone's debt crisis at a summit on Thursday than to calm nervous financial markets -- failure could spoil their summer holiday plans. 

 German Chancellor Angela Merkel, a pivotal player in efforts to rescue debt-ridden Greece and stem broader market turmoil in the region, is due to head off on a two-week hiking holiday in the mountains of northern Italy. French President Nicolas Sarkozy has been traveling back and forth to his French Riviera residence to be with pregnant wife Carla Bruni in recent weeks, and hopes to do so with less frequent interruptions in August. In addition to the leaders of the 17 countries that use the euro, an army of civil servants, central bankers and support staff also risk having their holidays canceled if no solution is found to the euro zone crisis and more talks are needed. At the executive European Commission's headquarters in Brussels, thousands of civil servants are obliged to take summer leave in August to ensure the European machine works at full speed the rest of the year. This year is no exception for the bulk of those working to resolve the debt crisis. "It's crazy if you think about it," said a senior European Commission official involved in working on solutions for Greece and the wider euro zone economy. "I'm here if needed, but there are plenty of support staff and economic staff who are taking holidays as normal." German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble, like Merkel, is about to head off from the end of next week and plans to be away until early September, a spokesman said. Merkel's break starts at the end of this week and she has no intention to alter her plans, her spokesman said. CALL FROM THE BEACH? Not everyone is so lucky. Officials from the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund go to Greece in late August to inspect the finances of the country where the crisis began and whose continuing problems triggered Thursday's talks on a further rescue package. Rental costs often double or even triple in Europe in this peak holiday period, and there are family commitments, advance bookings and non-refundable payments to think of. Finnish Prime Minister Jyrki Katainen interrupted his summer break to attend the summit in Brussels, but planned to resume it once the meeting finished, a government spokesman said. His foreign trade and European affairs minister, Alexander Stubb, advertised a solution which some, if not all, may be able to fall back on in the age of smart phones. "There are many ways to begin your second day of holidays," he told followers on the Twitter micro-blogging network earlier this week. "One of them is to participate in a gvt mtg (government meeting) through a conf(erence) call on the beach." That may be the only option for some, including some of the busiest members of Sarkozy's government. He told them this month: "Ministers are on duty all the time, 365 days a year. They can rest up but they are not on vacation."
