 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Whirlpool Corp ( WHR.N ) missed Wall Street expectations and issued a disappointing 2011 forecast as the world's largest appliance maker grapples with rising costs and weak consumer demand in North America, its biggest market. 

 In a worrying sign, demand slowed in previously strong markets such as India as well. The news came just days after Swedish rival Electrolux ( ELUXb.ST ) posted disappointing results and issued a gloomy forecast for the rest of the year citing weak demand in mature markets such as the United States, Spain and Italy. "The U.S. market remains challenging," Raymond James analyst Sam Darkatsh said earlier this week. "We are concerned that a 'day of reckoning' ultimately looms should production-based U.S. energy tax credits expire at the end of this year as expected." The federal government has been offering tax incentives to encourage shoppers to turn in their old inefficient appliances and buy slightly more expensive but energy-efficient models. Those credits are still being offered but have been trimmed back from last year. Even Philips ( PHG.AS ), Europe's largest maker of consumer electronics, reported a surprise loss and gave a bleak outlook for the next two quarters. Shoppers on both sides of the Atlantic are spending less on washers, dryers and other expensive items as they cope with rising food and fuel prices. Global consumer confidence fell in the second quarter to its lowest level in 18 months as an uncertain economic outlook, a deepening euro zone debt crisis and rising inflation made people cautious, a Nielsen survey showed. In addition to weak demand, appliance makers are fighting high costs of materials such as steel, copper and oil as well. Whirlpool, the maker of Maytag and KitchenAid appliances, said on Thursday its second-quarter net loss was $161 million, or $2.10 a share, compared with year-earlier net earnings of $205 million, or $2.64 a share. Excluding items, it earned $2.76 a share, missing the analysts' average estimate of $2.83, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Sales rose 4 percent to $4.73 billion, but missed the analysts' average estimate of $4.74 billion. The company expects 2011 U.S. industry unit shipments to fall by 1 percent to 2 percent. North America is its largest market. Whirlpool's Asia unit sales fell 2 percent to $257 million mainly on slowing industry demand in India. Excluding the currency impact, sales fell about 5 percent. "We expect global economic volatility to continue in the near term," CEO Jeff Fettig said. "We are rapidly adjusting to a much more challenging global economic environment." The company expects 2011 operating earnings per share at the low end of its prior outlook of $12 to $13 a share. Its shares were off 2 percent at $74.20 in light premarket trading.
