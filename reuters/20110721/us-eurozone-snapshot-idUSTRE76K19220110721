 LONDON, Jul  (Reuters) - It's decision day. 

 Merkel and Sarkozy have reached a common position, crucially after talking with Trichet who has ruled out any form of Greek default, but they won't say what it is (perhaps they have heeded anger of their euro zone peers at previous Franco-German "stitch-ups"). For the markets, it will have to be a significant package. Riskier assets have rallied this week on a wave of optimism so they are set for a fall if the euro zone leaders fall short. The sherpas meet this morning to thrash out the details and the leaders gather at lunchtime in Brussels. One safe bet is that talks will run late. One way or another, Greece should get another bailout of similar size to the 110 billion euros it got last year. The big imponderable remains the extent of private creditor involvement in a second Greek bailout, which the Germans, Dutch and others insist upon. Given Trichet's involvement in the Merkel/Sarkozy seven hour talks marathon, a key area to watch is any last minute wobbling by the ECB on its opposition to any sort of default. A Nowotny-style admission that a quick default may be no disaster would open all sorts of doors - to Germany's bond swap scheme or a bond rollover which the French favored. The ratings agencies have said both would probably be viewed as defaults. The proposed levy on banks may not be a default but the banks are howling about that, and even threatening legal action (its certainly true that it would take time for national governments to legislate on this). The banks will put a single proposal to the summit, though it could include a number of options. Bank sources say a levy may be the policy of last resort for euro zone leaders if nothing else flies -- a "sticking plaster deal" as one senior euro zone official put it. Alternatively, it could be a stick with which to beat the banks toward a bond swap or rollover. Latest from our sources is that there will be no bank tax in the Greek package. Another live option is that the EFSF rescue fund could be reconfigured to buy back bonds on the secondary market but this poses problems too. Changes to the EFSF's mandate would probably require parliamentary ratification in all euro zone countries. At the very least, that would be time consuming and time is the most precious commodity. The parliamentary process could be swerved by getting the EFSF to lend money to Greece to buy its own bonds back. Further out, we shouldn't rule anything out. (Most) policymakers' minds have been focused since markets turned their fire on Italy, far too big a bailout pill for the EU to swallow. So, dramatic policy prescriptions, previously ruled out, are back in the melting pot. Interestingly, the French have begun expressing frustration at Germany's opposition to a common euro zone bond - another device which could have a profound impact but which would potentially raise Germany's borrowing costs toward a mean common denominator. Today is too soon for that but its day may well yet come. You know things are serious when the arch eurosceptic UK finance minister, George Osborne, presses for further euro zone integration (not including Britain of course). He too advocated the euro zone bond. Britain's fears crystallize the big fear of contagion. British banks have little exposure to Greece but they do to French banks (which are loaded with Greek debt) and, of course, Ireland. So if confidence in banks falters, everybody will succumb, a la 2007. Our contagion test today comes courtesy of a Spanish bond auction. The irony of Osborne pressing for the fundamental changes the euro zone probably needs to survive and thrive will not be lost by those in Brussels but in the long-term they would probably not disagree.
