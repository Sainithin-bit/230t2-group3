 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Morgan Stanley's commodities trading risk fell in the second quarter from the first, lagging Wall Street rivals such as Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan, which raised risks in the same period for trading raw materials derivatives. 

 While Morgan Stanley outperformed its peers with better overall results in the second quarter, its Value-at-Risk (VaR) for commodities fell to $30 million per day on the average from $33 million in the first quarter, quarterly results from the investment bank showed on Thursday. VaR is an industry measure for how much of a bank's money is at risk on a day for trading a particular asset class. Goldman Sachs' raised its commodities VaR to $39 million in the second quarter from $37 million on the average in the first. JPMorgan hiked its risk in the asset class to $16 million from $13 million. (Reporting by Barani Krishnan; Editing by  Alden Bentley )
