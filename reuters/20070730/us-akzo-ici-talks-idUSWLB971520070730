 LONDON  (Reuters) - Britain's Imperial Chemical Industries ICI.L said on Monday it was still in talks with Akzo Nobel ( AKZO.AS ) after rejecting a 7.8 billion pound ($15.9 billion) bid from its Dutch rival, but had not opened its books. 

 "The board of ICI considered this revised proposal (of 650 pence a share from Akzo Nobel) and unanimously rejected it on the grounds that it failed to recognize the full strategic value of ICI," the British firm said in a statement. "Subsequently, ICI met with Akzo to advise that the proposal was rejected and to explore whether it could be increased. This meeting did not result in an improved proposal. Discussions are continuing, however, ICI has not granted Akzo access to due diligence information."
