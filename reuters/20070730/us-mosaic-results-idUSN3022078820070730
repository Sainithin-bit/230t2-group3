 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Agricultural chemicals maker The Mosaic Co. ( MOS.N ) posted a quarterly profit on Monday after a year-ago loss, as sales increased 27 percent on demand for fertilizers. 

 Net income for the fiscal fourth quarter was $202.6 million, or 46 cents per share, compared with a year-ago loss of $180.9 million, or 48 cents per share, the Plymouth, Minnesota-based company said. Net sales rose 27 percent to $1.68 billion. Analysts on average were expecting 40 cents per share in earnings and revenue of $1.689 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. Non-cash foreign currency transaction losses were $53.5 million for the quarter compared with losses of $34.1 million for the same period a year ago, the company said. This charge was mainly the effect of a stronger Canadian dollar on significant U.S. dollar-denominated intercompany receivables held by Mosaic's Canadian affiliates. With prices of major crops hovering at historically high levels, demand for fertilizers to help boost yields has grown and last week, Mosaic's rival Potash Corp. ( POT.TO ) ( POT.N ) posted a 63 percent jump in profits. In March, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said that U.S. farmers were going to plant 90.5 million acres of corn, the largest domestic corn acreage in 63 years. President and Chief Executive Officer Jim Prokopanko said the strong cash flow allowed the company to repay more than $450 million of long-term debt since the beginning of the fourth quarter. "We expect to repay additional debt during fiscal 2008 if these strong markets continue." Mosaic said the phosphate and potash markets show strong fundamentals and global demand growth of 3 percent to 4 percent over the next year is expected to exceed increases in capacity, resulting in continuing tight market balances. Sales volumes for the phosphates business are anticipated to range from 8.6 million tons to 9.1 million tons during fiscal 2008. Potash sales volumes for fiscal 2008 are anticipated to increase to 8.5 million to 9.0 million tons, the company said. Mosaic anticipates capital spending ranging between $360 million and $400 million during fiscal 2008 compared with $292.1 million in fiscal 2007.
