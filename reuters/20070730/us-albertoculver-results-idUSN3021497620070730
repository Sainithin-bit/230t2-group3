 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Alberto-Culver Co. Inc. ACV.N posted a 17.8 percent drop in quarterly profit on Monday after special items and discontinued operations but earnings from continuing operations improved. 

 The company, which makes such products as Alberto VO5 shampoo, is still looking for acquisitions, particularly in skin care and possibly beauty care, Chief Executive V. James Marino told Reuters. Alberto-Culver is a smaller company focused on consumer products after spinning off Sally Beauty Holdings Inc. ( SBH.N ), its retail arm and the larger of its two businesses, in November. The company announced a restructuring plan in December. Profit fell to $25.1 million, or 25 cents per share, in the third quarter ended June 30 from $30.5 million, or 33 cents per share, a year earlier. Earnings from continuing operations rose 18.2 percent to $24.2 million, or 24 cents per share. Analysts on average expected a profit of 24 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Sales rose 9.2 percent to $385.5 million, topping analysts' average forecast of $378.24 million. Bear Stearns analyst Justin Hott, who has an "outperform" rating on the shares, said the results were "good, but in line with expectations." FUTURE DEALS? Acquisitions are the first priority for Alberto-Culver's $330 million in cash, Chief Financial Officer Ralph Nicoletti said during a conference call. During an interview, he also said the company is looking at ways to create infrastructure in markets where it doesn't already operate. CEO Marino declined to say whether Alberto-Culver took a look at Hawaiian Tropic, which Playtex Products Inc. PYX.N bought in April, or comment on other deals it may have eyed. One of the reasons Playtex bought that brand was for its international reach. "We're trying to be very aggressive in terms of the landscape and not leaving any stone unturned here with respect to brands and/or companies that offer us an opportunity and not just here in the United State," CEO Marino told Reuters. "Having said that, acquisitions are not easy in today's environment and we're also discriminating." Smaller consumer products companies are in the spotlight since Playtex agreed to be bought by Energizer Holdings Inc. ( ENR.N ) earlier this month. Hott called Alberto "an attractive M&A target." Still, he pointed out that the shares remain highly valued for the sector. Alberto-Culver's 2008 price-to-earnings ratio, at 20.7 times expected earnings, exceeds most of its rivals including Procter & Gamble Co. ( PG.N ), which trades at 18.1 times its expected 2008 profit, according to Reuters data. The TRESemme and Nexxus hair-care brands did well during the quarter. TRESemme has been promoted on Bravo's "Project Runway" fashion design television show, while Nexxus sponsors the channel's "Shear Genius" hairdresser competition show. Meanwhile, the St. Ives lotion business has been challenging and the company is taking steps to improve that brand, Marino said. Alberto-Culver would also like to find a more premium skin-care brand to compliment St. Ives, he said. Shares of Melrose Park, Illinois-based Alberto-Culver were down 6 cents at $24.39 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
