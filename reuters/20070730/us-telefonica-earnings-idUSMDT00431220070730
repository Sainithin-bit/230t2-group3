 MADRID  (Reuters) - Spain's Telefonica ( TEF.MC ) posted a forecast-beating 66 percent rise in first half net profit to 3.83 billion euros ($5.23 billion) on Monday, backed by strength in its domestic and mobile businesses. 

 Telefonica upgraded full year group earnings guidance as many analysts had expected. Operating income before depreciation and amortization (OIBDA) rose 21.9 percent to 11.27 billion euros. A Reuters poll of 10 analysts expected Europe's number two telecoms group to post a 57.5 percent increase in first half profit to 3.63 billion euros on revenues of 27.68 billion euros and core earnings (OIBDA) of 11.31 billion euros. The company holds a conference call at 1400 GMT at which analysts are looking out for news of how its efforts to buy control of Brazilian joint venture Vivo VIVO4.SA are going.
