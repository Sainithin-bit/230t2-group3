 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - U.S. shares looked set to open firmer on Monday, recovering from the worst week for the S&P 500 index  .SPX  in nearly five years, with little on the agenda for the first day of another busy earnings week. 

 By 0933 GMT, Dow futures, S&P futures and Nasdaq futures were all up between 0.3 and 0.4 percent. "This isn't a turnaround of the downward trend. This is just a small technical market reaction, which is not based on economic fundamentals," said Lutz Roehmeyer, a fund manager at LBB Invest. U.S. stocks plunged for a second day on Friday as tightening credit conditions led to concerns that takeovers would slow. The low levels may now attract buyers again, Roehmeyer said. Companies due to report quarterly earnings on Monday include Loews LTR.N, Sun Microsystems SUNW.O and Verizon Communications ( VZ.N ). The U.S. earning season is going well so far, Roehmeyer said, pointing out that so far about 65 percent of the S&P 500 companies that have already reported beat market expectations. However, upbeat earnings were overshadowed by problems in the U.S. subprime sector, Roehmeyer added. On Friday, the Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  fell 1.54 percent, the Standard & Poor's 500 Index was down 1.60 percent and the Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  ended 1.43 percent lower. Also in focus may be the takeover battle surrounding news organization Dow Jones DJ.N. Members of the family that controls Dow Jones have been asked to decide by the end of the day whether they will support News Corp.'s NWSa.N $5 billion bid, a source familiar with the situation said Sunday.
