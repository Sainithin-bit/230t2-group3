 DETROIT  (Reuters) - General Motors Corp. ( GM.N ) is expected to report a swing to profit for the second quarter as the automaker benefited from a better mix of products and strong growth in emerging markets. 

 Still, analysts remained cautious about the weakness in the U.S. housing market, which could weigh on GM's results through the remainder of the year, and about sustainable profitability in its North American operations. Analysts, on average, expect GM to post on Tuesday a second-quarter net profit of $1.10 a share, compared with a net loss of $5.98 a share a year earlier. The per-share profit estimates range from $1.00 to $1.28. Excluding one-time items, GM is expected to post a narrower profit, with analyst estimates averaging $1.08 a share compared with a profit of $2.03 a share a year earlier. GM, which has lost more than $12 billion in the past two years, is in the middle of a sweeping restructuring that includes slashing more than 34,000 jobs and closing 12 plants in North America. Despite shrinking market share at home, the company has been growing sales overseas, which accounted for 58 percent of its total second-quarter sales. But GM executives have said it is important to succeed in the United States -- the company's largest and historically most profitable market. GM's North American sales fell 7 percent in the second quarter, but rose 8.2 percent in the Asia-Pacific region, 4.7 percent in Europe and 20 percent in Latin America, Africa and the Middle East. Still, GM is on track to be overtaken by Japanese rival Toyota Motor Corp. ( 7203.T ) as the world's largest automaker this year. "International sales are positive, the company has made progress in cost-cutting and reducing overheads," Standard & Poor's equities analyst Efraim Levy said. "But their U.S. market share continues to shrink and June sales were disappointing, which could lead to lower production in the second half of the year," Levy added. Analysts have cautioned that GM might have to increase incentive spending to compete with aggressive rivals and clear showroom floors. GM's U.S. sales fell 21 percent in June. In fact, GM said on Monday it had begun offering zero-percent financing for up to 60 months on the extended and crew cab versions of its 2007 pickup trucks to respond to discounting by rivals. GMAC EARNINGS Analysts have also raised concern over GM's remaining exposure to the riskiest segment of the U.S. mortgage market through ResCap, the housing finance unit at GMAC. ResCap posted on Monday a loss of $254 million in the second quarter, after the U.S. subprime mortgage crisis pushed it to a loss of $910 million in the first quarter. Even though the finance unit has tightened underwriting standards, and slowed subprime loan volume at ResCap, provisioning for subprime mortgage losses at ResCap "could eat up all of GMAC's earnings for a while and then some," said Glenn Reynolds, analyst for fixed-income research service CreditSights. There is also the potential knock-on effect on GM sales as housing troubles worry consumers. Mike Jackson, chief executive of the largest U.S. dealership chain, AutoNation Inc. ( AN.N ), last week said he expected weak housing starts to weigh on auto sales for the remainder of the year. In May, GM estimated its cost of helping bankrupt supplier Delphi Corp. DPHIQ.PK cut labor expenses under an agreement with the United Auto Workers union to be $7 billion, up from a previous estimate of $6 billion. The automaker said it would report costs related to Delphi in the second quarter.
