 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury said on Monday it will have to borrow more during the third quarter than it previously thought it would, and that it did not pay off as much debt as it expected in the second quarter. 

 In its quarterly estimate of borrowing needs, Treasury said it will need to borrow $73 billion of net marketable debt in the July-September third quarter, some $31 billion more than it thought in April. "The increase in borrowing is primarily the result of higher outlays, lower net issuance of state and local government series securities and adjustments in quarterly cash balances," Treasury said in an announcement of its anticipated borrowing needs. During the April-June second quarter, Treasury said it paid down $139 billion, finishing on June 30 with a cash balance of $25 billion. That was $6 billion less than Treasury estimated in April that it would pay down -- a difference it said was "primarily the result of slightly lower receipts." Treasury said that, in the October-December fourth quarter, it expects to borrow $74 billion of net marketable debt and to have a cash balance of $30 billion on hand on December 31. On Wednesday, the Treasury will announce the amounts of particular securities that it intends to sell during the third quarter to raise the money it forecasts it will need. One of Treasury's principal functions is to help manage the nation's finances by selling debt securities to raise the money needed for the day-to-day operations of government, from maintaining national defense to paying pensions. In a statement, Treasury's assistant secretary for economic policy, Phillip Swagel, said most economic sectors were healthy and that low unemployment and steady wage gains should bring a rebound in consumer spending. "Although the housing sector continues to be weak, and may remain a drag on GDP (gross domestic product) for the next several quarters, fundamentals provide a firm foundation for solid performance by the other sectors of the economy through the rest of the year," Swagel said. He added that inflation pressures seemed "broadly contained" but described energy prices as "volatile."
