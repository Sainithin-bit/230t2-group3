 LONDON  (Reuters) - HSBC Holdings ( HSBA.L ), Europe's biggest bank, said a 63 percent jump in bad debts in the first half of the year had been in line with its expectations and it was pleased with how it is dealing with its exposure to U.S. housing market problems. 

 "We're very pleased with progress in mortgage services, although clearly there's a long way to go," Douglas Flint, HSBC finance director, told reporters on a conference call. "The important thing from our perspective is the charges were in line with our expectations ... the deterioration is as expected and therefore is as priced for." HSBC's impairments were $3.89 billion in the first half after it wrote off $10.6 billion in 2006, largely due to cover bad loans made to U.S. home owners. The rest of the year is likely to remain tough, Flint said, however, due to an expected rise in the number of homeowners on 2-year fixed rate mortgages adjusting to higher rates. Flint estimated HSBC will see "just over $5 billion" of mortgage resets in the second half, but he said at the start of the year it had expected $10 billion of resets in 2007, including $7 billion in the second half.
