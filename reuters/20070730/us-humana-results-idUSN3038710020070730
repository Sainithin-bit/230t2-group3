 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Health insurer Humana Inc. ( HUM.N ) on Monday posted a 19 percent in revenue as membership in its Medicare health plans for seniors grew and the company projected its full-year profit margin for its Medicare products would reach the high end of its previous forecast. 

 Shares of Humana, one of the largest providers of Medicare plans, rose 1.2 percent in early trading. Second-quarter revenue increased to $6.43 billion from $5.41 billion. Net income rose to $216.8 million, or $1.28 per share, compared with $89.5 million, or 53 cents a share, a year earlier. The Louisville, Kentucky-based company announced the same earnings-per-share figures on July 18, but did not provide aggregate net income and revenue numbers. At that time, Humana attributed the better-than-expected profit to strong performance in both its Medicare business and the commercial segment that serves employers. It also raised its full-year outlook. An aggressive bid by the company to expand its Medicare business, taking advantage of federal laws allowing a greater role for the private sector, has paid off for shareholders this year. Shares of Humana, the fifth-largest U.S. health insurer by market value, were up 17 percent in 2007 before Monday's trading, outpacing rivals. They rose 15 cents to $64.96 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange. ENROLLMENT Enrollment in Humana's Medicare Advantage full-service plans was 1.13 million members at June 30, 18 percent higher than a year earlier. Membership in its Medicare plans covering prescription drugs fell slightly from a year ago to 3.44 million at June 30. The company's medical expense ratio -- the percentage of premiums it spends on medical costs -- improved to 83.4 percent from 85.1 percent a year earlier. Humana cited both its government and commercial businesses for the improvement. Humana said its 2007 pretax profit margin for its Medicare plans would be about 5 percent, compared with its prior projection of 4 percent to 5 percent. CEO Michael McCallister said on a conference call with analysts that 5 percent will remain the company's profit margin target for its overall Medicare business. "We think that's a reasonable amount to be paid to do this business," McCallister said. "Our future in Medicare is not so much margin expansion, it's on taking advantage of the huge opportunity to move people into private-sector plans." He noted that about 8 million people are in Medicare Advantage plans out of a total Medicare population of 47 million. McCallister also expressed confidence in his company's ability to weather any changes that may emerge to Medicare on Capitol Hill, where lawmakers are weighing reimbursement cuts. "We feel pretty confident in our ability to manage this regardless of what happens in Washington over the next six months," McCallister said. (Reporting by  Lewis Krauskopf  and  Franklin Paul )
