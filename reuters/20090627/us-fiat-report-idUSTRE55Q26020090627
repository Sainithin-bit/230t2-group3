 MILAN  (Reuters) - Italian automaker Fiat ( FIA.MI ) is open to issuing a bond for institutional or retail investors, or both, Chief Executive Sergio Marchionne said on Saturday, according to news agency Ansa. 

 On Friday, Marchionne had said that reports Fiat might launch a bond of around 1 billion euros were "rumors" adding, "We will announce it when we announce it." Asked at an event in Venice on Saturday whether Fiat would be willing to issue a bond for the retail or institutional market, Marchionne said: "We are open to doing either, or a mix." "With the interest rates that are around at the moment, it could be a big deal for everyone," he added. Italian oil company ENI ( ENI.MI ) said on Friday offers for its retail bond topped 5.8 billion euros compared with a maximum offer amount of 2 billion euros. Marchionne also said it was premature to discuss any plans regarding production at its joint venture plant near Valenciennes in France with PSA Peugeot Citroen ( PEUP.PA ). Fiat has taken a 20 percent stake in U.S. car maker Chrysler CBS.UL and Marchionne is working to put together a plan for the U.S. car maker's product offer. Daily Il Giornale had cited rumors the Fiat-Chrysler plan could see the platform for Chrysler's Voyager model extended to the Phedra, affecting a collaboration Fiat has with PSA. "The Voyager platform will continue to be American because it was born there," Ansa quoted Marchionne saying. "It is premature to talk about convergence (until) we have decided with the French what Valenciennes will do," he said.
