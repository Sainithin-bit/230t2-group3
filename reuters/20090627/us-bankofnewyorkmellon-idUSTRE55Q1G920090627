 ZURICH  (Reuters) - Bank of New York Mellon Corp will have further writedowns as a result of the securitized mortgages it still has on its books, the bank's chief executive was quoted as saying on Saturday. 

 "Yes, we will book further writedowns but we will be able to handle them. The securitized mortgages on our books amount to $3 to $4 billion, which corresponds to only 2 percent of our balance sheet," CEO Robert Kelly told Switzerland's Finanz und Wirtschaft. Kelly said the bank, which saw first-quarter profit fall more than expected in April, would be profitable in 2009. "BNY Mellon has posted a profit in all quarters of the crisis. We will also be profitable in 2009," he said. Bank of New York Mellon, which is working on expanding its presence in China, would like to grow in continental Europe and Asia, Kelly said.
