 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Bank regulators closed Mirae Bank, of Los Angeles, on Friday, the 45th U.S. bank to fail this year as the struggling economy and falling home prices take their toll on financial institutions. 

 The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp said Mirae Bank had $456 million in assets and $362 million in deposits, as of May 29. The failure is expected to cost the FDIC deposit insurance fund an estimated $50 million. Wilshire State Bank, of Los Angeles, agreed to assume the insured deposits and $449 of the assets of Mirae Bank, whose five offices branches will reopen on Monday as branches of Wilshire State Bank.
