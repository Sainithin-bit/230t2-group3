 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Shares of Biomet Inc. BMET.O rose about 4 percent on Monday following weekend reports that European rival Smith & Nephew ( SN.L ) would make an $11 billion bid for the company. 

 Biomet was trading $1.59 higher at $41.49 in morning trading on Nasdaq. Sources familiar with the situation told Reuters on Sunday that Smith & Nephew, Europe's biggest medical device maker, is in preliminary talks with Biomet over a potential tie-up. The move is seen as an effort to gain scale to compete against rivals like Johnson & Johnson ( JNJ.N ), Zimmer Holdings ( ZMH.N ) and Stryker Corp. ( SYK.N ) in the artificial hip and knee market. Biomet in April said it hired Morgan Stanley to explore strategic options, a week after longtime chief executive officer and company founder Dane Miller abruptly resigned. One of the sources told Reuters bids were due by Tuesday and that other companies would likely submit offers. "It probably isn't the last we're going to hear of who is going to bid for this," Raj Denhoy, an analyst at Piper Jaffray, said. A spokeswoman for Biomet was not available for comment. Stryker rose 1.1 percent and Zimmer was up 0.7 percent on the New York Stock Exchange.
