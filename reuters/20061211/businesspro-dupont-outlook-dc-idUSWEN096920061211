 HOUSTON  (Reuters) - Chemicals group DuPont Co. ( DD.N ) said 
on Monday it would close or streamline 10 plants and cut 1,500 
jobs - 2.5 percent of its overall workforce - as part of a plan 
to restructure its nutrition and crop protection business. 

  The company plans to boost its investments in plant 
genetics and biotechnology while cutting back spending on its 
crop protection and nutrition businesses. it plans to take a 
$200 million charge in the fourth quarter for the 
restructuring.  Despite that charge, the company raised its outlook for 
2006 net earnings per share to $3.25 because of higher net 
one-time gains of 39 cents per share, or $370 million, expected 
in the fourth quarter.  Previously DuPont had estimated its earnings would total 
$2.86 per share, including 1 cent of one-time gains.  Under the largest of the one-time items, the company will 
record a $500 million after-tax gain related to tax settlements 
and interest for its repatriation of foreign earnings.  DuPont expects to save about $100 million per year by 
reducing operating costs at the nutrition and crop protection 
operations, and would invest that money in its seed business.
