 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson warned on Monday that the top-level delegation he leads to Beijing this week may not produce immediate results and said the focus on opening China's markets must be long-term. 

 "There is a tendency in Washington to want immediate answers, but a relationship this important will have consequences for our economy and for our nation over generations," Paulson said in prepared remarks for delivery to a housing forum sponsored by the Office of Thrift Supervision. Paulson is leading a delegation of six other cabinet officers, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and dozens of staff members to China for talks that he said will discuss "the importance of a sustainable growth in China which improves the balance of trade." He said the talks on Thursday and Friday under the auspices of a "strategic economic dialogue" announced in September are to lay a basis for future progress. "Our outlook with China has to be long-term," Paulson said.
