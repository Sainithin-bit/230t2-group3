 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Film company The Weinstein Co., and 
distributor Genius Products LLC are to co-produce and 
co-finance a slate of television productions in an alliance 
with RHI Entertainment, the companies said on Monday. 

  The Weinstein Company, founded by industry veteran brothers 
Bob and Harvey Weinstein, majority owns Genius. RHI 
Entertainment is a miniseries and movies-for-television 
company.  Weinstein Co. and Genius said they had entered into a 
strategic alliance with RHI under which they will co-produce 
and co-finance an extensive slate of television productions, 
including series, miniseries and movies-of-the-week.  Bob and Harvey Weinstein, Co-Chairmen of The Weinstein 
Company, founded and ran Miramax Films. They sold the company 
to Walt Disney Co. ( DIS.N ) in the early 1990s, then left 
Miramax more than a year ago.
