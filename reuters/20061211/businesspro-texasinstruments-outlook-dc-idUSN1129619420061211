 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Texas Instruments Inc TXN.N, the 
biggest maker of chips for mobile phones, on Monday reduced its 
fourth-quarter earnings outlook on lower-than-expected chip 
revenue. 

  The company, which makes everything from calculators to 
chips for flat-screen televisions, said it now expects earnings 
from continuing operations of 37 cents to 40 cents a share 
compared with its earlier target of 40 cents to 46 cents.  TI said it now expects revenue of $3.35 billion to $3.5 
billion for the quarter. In October it had forecast 
fourth-quarter revenue of $3.46 billion to $3.75 billion.  On average analysts had expected earnings of 43 cents a 
share on revenue of $3.58 billion, according to Reuters 
Estimates.  TI cut its forecast for revenue from chip sales to a range 
of $3.28 billion to $3.42 billion, versus its earlier view of 
$3.39 to $3.66 billion.  It said it now expects revenue from its calculator unit of 
$70 million to $80 million, compared with its earlier view of 
$70 million to $90 million.  The company's shares fell slightly in after hours trade 
after closing down 10 cents at $29.30 on the New York Stock 
Exchange on Monday.
