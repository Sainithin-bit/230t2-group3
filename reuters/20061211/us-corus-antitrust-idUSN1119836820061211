 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. antitrust authorities said on Monday they approved a proposal by India's Tata Steel ( TISC.BO ) to acquire Anglo-Dutch steelmaker Corus Group 

  CS.L. Officials have completed their investigation of Tata's offer without taking any action, the Federal Trade Commission said in a notice. Brazilian steelmaker Companhia Siderurgica Nacional or CSN ( CSNA3.SA ) ( SID.N ) on Monday it offered to buy Corus for 4.9 billion pounds ($9.6 billion) in cash, topping an offer made earlier by Tata. A takeover of Corus by either CSN or Tata Steel would create the world's fifth-biggest steelmaker, producing around 24 million tonnes of steel a year.
