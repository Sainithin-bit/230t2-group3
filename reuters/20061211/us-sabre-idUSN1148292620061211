 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Multiple firms including Silver Lake Partners and Texas Pacific Group have bid for Sabre Holdings TSG.N, owner of the Travelocity Web site, according to a source familiar with the situation. 

 Shares in Sabre, which has a market capitalization of about $4 billion, rose about 7 percent in early trading after the New York Times first reported a deal could take place for more than the company's market capitalization. A Sabre spokesman declined to comment, saying the company does not comment on rumors and speculation. A spokesman for Texas Pacific declined to comment. A Silver Lake spokesman was not immediately available. Bids for the company were due at the end of last week with private equity firms seen as the most interested, the source said. Two investor groups are vying for Southlake, Texas-based Sabre and a third is considering a bid, according to the Times. One group includes Texas Pacific and Silver Lake, the source said. A successful bid would mean that two of the top four online travel agencies would be private. Earlier this year, an affiliate of the Blackstone Group bought Travelport, operator of the Orbitz travel site. The chief executives of online travel agencies Expedia Inc. ( EXPE.O ) and Priceline ( PCLN.O ) each predicted last month that travel sites would attract more private equity. Sabre ad a market capitalization of about $3.7 billion based on Friday's closing share price of $28.32, before the report was published. Private equity buyers are rife with cash and estimated to raise a record $300 billion this year for their investment funds. Many are looking to put the money to work quickly and have turned to cash-rich industries where they can find an open door, from technology to casinos to health care. In addition to operating Travelocity, Sabre also provides reservation systems for travel agents and has recently concluded a series of multiyear deals with major U.S. airlines. Sabre shares rose $1.83, or 6.5 percent, to $30.15 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange, after reaching as much as $31.21 -- its highest level since July 2002 -- shortly after the market opened.
