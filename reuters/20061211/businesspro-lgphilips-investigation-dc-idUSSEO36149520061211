 SEOUL  (Reuters) - South Korean flat screen maker LG.Philips 
LCD Co. Ltd. ( 034220.KS ) ( LPL.N ) on Monday said it was being 
investigated by fair trade watchdogs from Korea and Japan and 
had received a subpoena from the U.S. Department of Justice. 

  The company, a joint venture between LG Electronics Inc. 
( 066570.KS ) and Philips Electronics ( PHG.AS ), said it would 
cooperate fully with authorities.  "Last Friday, as part of an investigation of possible 
anticompetitive conduct in the LCD industry, officials from the 
Korean Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) visited the offices of 
LG.Philips LCD in Seoul, Korea," LG.Philips said in statement.  "In addition, the Japanese Fair Trade Commission (JFTC) 
issued a notice to our offices in Tokyo, Japan and the United 
States Department of Justice (DOJ) issued a subpoena to our 
offices in San Jose, California."  "LG.Philips LCD takes this matter very seriously and will 
cooperate fully with regulatory authorities," the company 
added.  A spokesman at the KFTC declined to comment on the 
investigation but said the investigation was being conducted by 
the Cartel Investigation Group.  LG.Philips was the world's biggest maker of the large LCD 
panels used in flat-screen TVs and PC monitors last year.  But in 2006, the loss-making company has been overtaken by 
rival Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd. ( 005930.KS ), which teamed up 
with Japan's Sony Corp. ( 6758.T ).  The company is struggling with weak prices and high costs 
for its mainstay TV panels. Analysts point to its lack of a 
diversified client base as one of the reasons behind its weak 
pricing power.  Before the company's announcement, shares in LG.Philips 
ended down 1.1 percent at 27,000 won, against the benchmark 
stock index's  .KS11  0.02 percent rise.
