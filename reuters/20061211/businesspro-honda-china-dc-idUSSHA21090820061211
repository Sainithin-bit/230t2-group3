 SHANGHAI  (Reuters) - Honda Motor's ( 7267.T ) China vehicle 
sales rose 23.2 percent from a year earlier in the first 11 
months of 2006, lagging the growth of the overall market. 

  Honda, maker of the Accord, Civic and Odyssey models, sold 
287,730 vehicles in China in January-November, up from 233,520 
units in the same period of 2005, it said on Monday.  Sales at its Guangzhou Honda venture climbed 10.7 percent 
to 233,033 vehicles, while sales at its venture in central 
China gained 36.8 percent to 54,697 units. The vast majority of 
vehicles sold were cars.  China's overall car sales surged 30.91 percent to 4.61 
million units during the period, according to figures provided 
by the national auto association.  In November Honda, which competes with Toyota Motor Corp. 
( 7203.T ), Ford Motor Co. ( F.N ) and others in the world's second 
largest auto market, moved 33,881 vehicles in China, up 45.3 
percent from a year earlier, it said.  Honda has targeted sales of 350,000 cars in China this 
year, up 36 percent from 2005 but lagging growth at many of its 
competitors, including Toyota and Ford.  It aims to boost its share of the Chinese car market to at 
least 10 percent by the end of this decade from around 7.5 
percent estimated for this year, Atsuyoshi Hyogo, senior 
managing director and chief operating officer of Honda's China 
operations, said last month.
