 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Inventories at U.S. wholesalers rose a larger-than-expected 0.8 percent in October led by autos, machinery and computer equipment, while sales fell 0.5 percent, the government said on Monday. 

 Analysts polled by Reuters had projected a 0.5 percent gain in wholesale inventories in October. The inventory-to-sales ratio, a gauge of how many months it would take to deplete existing stocks at the current sales pace, rose to 1.20 in October, its highest since 1.20 in June 2005, from 1.18 in September. Wholesale inventories gained a revised 0.7 percent in September, previously reported at up 0.9 percent. Auto inventories in October rose 0.9 percent, machinery gained 1 percent, and computer equipment was up 2.3 percent. All told, durable goods inventories were up 0.7 percent while nondurable goods were up 0.9 percent. The sales decline was led by machinery, hardware and electrical equipment. Auto sales reported by wholesalers rose 2.5 percent, which caused the inventory-to-sales ratio to fall 1.39 months from 1.41 in September. Paper, drugs and apparel also gained in October.
