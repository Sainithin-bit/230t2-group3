 BEIJING  (Reuters) - China promised on Monday to respond positively to the United States in high-level economic talks this week but drew a line in the sand by telling Washington that its exchange rate is a matter of national sovereignty. 

 Underscoring the economic imbalances that will be at the heart of the discussions, China on Monday reported a trade surplus for November of $22.9 billion, just shy of October's record $23.8 billion and more than double that of November 2005. The surplus handed fresh ammunition to U.S. critics who say China is unfairly holding down the value of its currency to give its exporters an edge in global markets. U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, who leads a high-level delegation to China this week, warned Beijing on Friday that the world was growing impatient for economic and currency reforms. Following up on Monday in an article he wrote in the Washington Post, Paulson added: "The United States believes China can do more to reduce its trade surplus. We are encouraging China to introduce greater flexibility for its currency." In response, central bank governor Zhou Xiaochuan stressed the importance of the talks for coordinating policy and for tackling the two-way trade imbalance and other issues. "I think that Hank Paulson raised the requirement to have an economic dialogue. We are prepared to give a very positive and active response to that," Zhou told a financial forum. A report in the New York Times on Friday quoted an unnamed Chinese official as saying there would be a package of "deliverables" to show this week's so-called "strategic economic dialogue" can produce results. One of Zhou's assistant governors, Yi Gang, reaffirmed Beijing's determination to let market forces play a greater role in determining the yuan's exchange rate. But currency adjustments alone could not iron out trade imbalances, Yi told reporters at the forum. "The exchange rate issue is A) a sovereign issue and this is our principle. B) We will take internal and external balances into account when making decisions on the yuan," he said. China has let the yuan rise by around 3.45 percent since it revalued the currency by 2.1 percent in July 2005, but U.S. lawmakers and business groups say the currency remains grossly undervalued given China's bulging balance-of-payments surplus. WORKSHOP OF THE WORLD Deng Xianhong, vice-head of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, the currency regulator, reaffirmed China's intention to gradually promote capital account convertibility so that the yuan will one day be freely tradable for purely financial purposes. Deng also said that China was particularly keen for its industrial companies to pursue mergers and acquisitions abroad. That could foreshadow further friction with the United States, where political opposition last year forced a Chinese oil company to abandon efforts to buy Californian rival Unocal. November's trade surplus, which exceeded economists' forecasts of $20.1 billion, took the running total for the latest 12 months to $167.5 billion from $155.1 billion in October. In all of 2005, the surplus tripled to $102 billion. Exports soared 32.8 percent from a year earlier, while imports grew 18.3 percent, the customs administration said. "This is very strong. It highlights China's competitiveness and strength as the world's factory," said Dong Tao, a senior economist with Credit Suisse in Hong Kong. He said China would probably let the yuan rise a little faster even though that would not tackle the root cause of the trade friction with the United States. "If Americans keep spending as they have been doing, a stronger Chinese currency won't necessarily correct the trade imbalance. The bottom line is Americans need to spend less and Chinese need to spend more," he said. (Additional reporting by  Tamora Vidaillet  and Susan Fenton)
