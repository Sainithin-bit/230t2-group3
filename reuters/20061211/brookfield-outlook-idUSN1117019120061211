 TORONTO  Dec 11 (Reuters) - Shares of Brookfield Properties
Corp. ( BPO.TO ) fell on Monday as news the company plans to sell
30 million shares more than offset its forecast that its 2007
funds from operations will top analysts' expectations.  Brookfield shares fell as much as C$1.24, or 2.7 percent,
to C$44.71 shortly after the open on the Toronto Stock Exchange
before recovering slightly to C$44.95, or a loss of 2 percent.
In New York, the shares fell 89 cents to $39.13.  The Canadian company has property holdings across North
America and is one of Manhattan's biggest office landlords. It
said before the markets opened that it expects FFO of $2.10 to
$2.20 a share for 2007, up about 17 percent from the midpoint
of its forecast for 2006 FFO, and also above analysts' average
forecast of $2.02, according to Reuters Estimates.  Funds from operations is a measure that removes distorting
effects of depreciation from the operating performance of real
estate companies.  Brookfield also said it had filed with regulators to sell
30 million shares, and that news weighed on its share price.
The sale would be worth $120 million, based on the company's
closing stock price of $40.01 in New York on Friday.  "You've got got 30 million common shares being issued and
the pricing has yet to be determined, so any time that happens
you automatically get the (arbitrage) traders coming in and
shorting it just on the expectation that you're getting a whack
of new equity," said Karine MacIndoe, an analyst at BMO Nesbitt
Burns.  "That said, once this is all settled you've got very
positive news...they've introduced 2007 guidance much higher
than the consensus gain is at."  Brookfield said its revised estimate assumes commercial net
operating income growth on a same-property basis of 4 percent
to 5 percent, continued strength in the energy-driven economy
in Alberta, Canada, and completion of the planned stock
offering.  Brookfield Asset Management ( BAMa.TO ) ( BAM.N ), which owns
about 51 percent of Brookfield Properties' outstanding shares,
will buy about 11.25 million of the 30 million shares in the
offering, Brookfield said.  Proceeds from the offering will be used to reduce debt,
repay lines of credit, and for general corporate purposes,
Brookfield said in a statement.   (Additional reporting by  Lilla Zuill  in New York)  ($1=$1.15 Canadian)
