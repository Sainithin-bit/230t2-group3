 BOSTON  (Reuters) - Computer and printer maker Hewlett-Packard Co. ( HPQ.N ) said on Monday that Chief Financial Officer Bob Wayman will retire as CFO at the end of the month, ending a 37-year career with the company. 

 Wayman, 61, will be succeeded by HP's treasurer, Cathie Lesjak, 47. Lesjak, a 20-year HP veteran, has been senior vice president and treasurer since 2003.

She will be promoted to executive vice president at an initial annual salary of $550,000 and a target bonus of $550,000. Palo Alto, California-based HP said that Wayman will retain his current seat on its board of directors through March but not stand for re-election. He will also remain a company employee through the end of March.
