 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Monsanto Co.'s ( MON.N ) attempt to buy 
southern seed giant Delta & Pine Land Co. DLP.N could be 
running into trouble as an unusual backlash against the 
proposed combination is taking root across the U.S. Farm Belt, 
the Wall Street Journal reported on its Web site on Monday. 

  Monsanto, the world's leading developer of biotech crops, 
said in August that it would buy Delta and Pine Land Co., the 
top U.S. seller of cotton seeds, for $1.5 billion in a deal 
that would give Monsanto a dominant position in the $40 billion 
cotton seed market.  The deal would give Monsanto more control over a major crop 
by a biotechnology company than ever before allowed, a prospect 
that upsets anti-biotechnology activists, the WSJ reported.  Some biotech-industry leaders are prodding the attorneys 
general of several states to look into the combination as an 
antitrust review by the Justice Department extends into its 
fourth month, the paper said.  Monsanto was not immediately available for comment.
