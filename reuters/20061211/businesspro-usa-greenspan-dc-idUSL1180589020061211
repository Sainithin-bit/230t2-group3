 TEL AVIV  (Reuters) - Former U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman 
Alan Greenspan said on Monday he expected the dollar to stay 
weak for the next few years and will continue to drift down, 
weighed by the U.S. balance of payments deficit. 

  "I expect that the dollar will continue to drift downwards 
until there will be a change in the U.S. balance of payments," 
Greenspan told a business conference here via video-link from 
the United States.  "There has been some evidence that OPEC nations are 
beginning to switch their reserves out of dollars and into euro 
and yen," Greenspan said.  "It is imprudent to hold everything in one currency," he 
said, adding that at some point the dollar will be moving 
lower.  "That will be the experience of the next few years," 
Greenspan said.  Greenspan said markets were so sophisticated it was very 
difficult to forecast the short term direction of the dollar.
