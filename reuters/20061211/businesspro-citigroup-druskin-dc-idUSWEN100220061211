 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Citigroup, ( C.N ) under pressure to cut 
costs and boost revenues, named investment banking head Robert 
Druskin as chief operating officer. 

  Druskin, previously president and chief executive officer 
of Citigroup's corporate and investment banking unit, will 
first focus on reviewing the company's expenses, Citi's Chief 
Executive Chuck Prince said in a statement.  Druskin, 59, will join Prince and Robert Rubin as members 
of the office of the chairman. All changes are effective 
January 1.  Citigroup, the largest U.S. bank by market capitalization, 
is facing investor pressure to improve its operating 
performance. In the first nine months of 2006, the company's 
income from continuing operations rose 9 percent, but operating 
expenses rose 13 percent, and revenue rose just 5 percent.  Druskin will be succeeded as president of the commercial 
and investment bank by Michael Klein and Thomas Maheras.
