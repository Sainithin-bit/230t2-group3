 TOKYO  (Reuters) - The Nikkei average rose 0.67 percent on Monday as Honda Motor Co. ( 7267.T ) and other exporters advanced on a weaker yen, while shares of Japanese seafood suppliers jumped after Maruha Group Inc. ( 1334.T ) said it plans to merge its operations with smaller rival Nichiro Corp. 1331.T. 

 Maruha said the combined company, to be founded on October 1, 2007, aims for an operating profit of 30 billion yen ($260 million) on sales of 1 trillion yen in 2010. <ID:nTKV002839> The latest move followed news last week that Japan Tobacco Inc. ( 2914.T ) may make a bid for British tobacco firm Gallaher Plc GLH.L, fuelling market expectations that industry consolidation will further accelerate next year. Investors also bought shares of firms with a high dividend yield such as steel makers, and their buying picked up after Nippon Steel Corp. ( 5401.T ) announced that it will strengthen ties with South Korean steelmaker POSCO ( 005490.KS ). <ID:nT235988> "Mergers and acquisitions should be a main topic in the Tokyo market next year, and investors have been buying shares of likely targets, such as steel companies," said Yasuo Yabe, director of sales at Meiwa Securities. A flurry of consolidation talks has swept through the steel industry after the creation of Arcelor Mittal ( ISPA.AS ) ( MT.N ) following an unsolicited takeover by Mittal Steel. It is now the world's biggest steel company, three times bigger than closest rival Nippon Steel. The Nikkei  .N225  gained 110.17 points to 16,527.99, the highest close since October 27. The broader TOPIX index  .TOPX  rose 0.72 percent to 1,627.97. Trade volume was fairly active, with 1.69 billion shares changing hands on the Tokyo exchange's first section. Advancers beat decliners by a ratio of more than two to one. TAX BREAKS, BOJ Yabe also said the Nikkei drew support from talks among members of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) about extending preferential tax measures on stocks. Business daily Nihon Keizai reported on Sunday that a tax panel of the ruling party is considering proposing temporary tax breaks should be extended until 2008. One preferential measure that cuts the tax rate on capital gains to 10 percent from 20 percent is due to expire at the end of next year, while another that reduces the tax rate on dividends will expire at the end of March 2008. Earlier this month, the Japanese government's tax panel, which is seen as less powerful than the LDP panel, proposed that preferential tax measures on stocks should end as planned. Masaki Iso, head of Japanese equities at Yasuda Asset Management Co. Ltd., said the Nikkei could test the April high of 17,563.37 by the end of the year, as Tokyo shares have been in a catch-up rally with U.S. and other Asian markets that hit record highs this year. "The Japanese market, which lagged behind foreign markets throughout the year, will be corrected higher toward the end of the year," he said. But the market may lose upward momentum if the Bank of Japan's quarterly tankan survey, due out on Friday, comes out with a strong reading and paves the way for the central bank to raise interest rates at its meeting next week, he said. The BOJ is widely expected to finalize its thinking on policy after the tankan, before its December 18-19 policy meeting. Shares of seafood companies shot up after Maruha's announcement fueled speculation of a further sector shake-up. Shares in industry leader Maruha, which posted a net profit of 4.6 billion yen on sales of 719.3 billion yen in the year ended March 2006, soared 6.4 percent to 250 yen, while Nichiro climbed 9.8 percent to 212 yen. Nippon Suisan Kaisha Ltd. ( 1332.T ), a seafood processing company, jumped 5.8 percent to 680 yen. Among similar firms, Housui Corp. ( 1352.T ) surged 7.0 percent to 199 yen while Kyokuyo Co. Ltd. ( 1301.T ) added 7.8 percent to 262 yen. Investors returned to exporters such as Honda after the yen retreated from a four-month high hit last week. The Japanese currency was trading at above 116.80 yen  JPY=  to the dollar, well below the level of 114.43 yen touched last week. Japan Tobacco climbed 2.9 percent to 566,000 yen. The company has risen 12.5 percent in the last three sessions on speculation it may bid for Gallaher, the manufacturer of "Silk Cut" brand cigarettes. ($1=116.75 Yen)
