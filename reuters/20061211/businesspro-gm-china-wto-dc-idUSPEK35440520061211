 BEIJING  (Reuters) - General Motors Corp., the world's 
largest auto maker, said on Monday that China's WTO entry has 
benefited both foreign and domestic auto makers, but that China 
should fully embrace the organization's spirit of free trade. 

  "The world needs China to play a leadership role in WTO," 
Nick Reilly, GM Asia Pacific president, told a news conference 
on the five-year anniversary of the mainland's entry into the 
World Trade Organization.  Many trading partners complain of China's huge trade 
surplus and slow moves to open its domestic market, but the 
emergence of the mainland has also helped boost global trade 
activity.  "Other new countries such as recently admitted Vietnam are 
looking at see how China plays the WTO game," said Reilly.  "Whether it merely seeks to meet the minimum requirements 
or whether it embraces the spirit of WTO."  The auto executive said more active participation in the 
WTO by China would benefit more people both in China and 
elsewhere.  "The fact of the matter is China's entry into the WTO has 
benefited companies large and small, multinational and local," 
he said.  China is now the world's second largest automobile market, 
which is still growing at a brisk pace.  (US$=7.83 yuan)
