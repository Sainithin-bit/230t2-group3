 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Liberty Media LCAPA.O will regain 
ownership of regional sports cable channels in Pittsburgh, 
Seattle and its home market of Denver, in a deal expected to be 
announced this week with News Corp. NWS.N, the Monday's Wall 
Street Journal said, citing people close to the situation. 

  With regional coverage of professional sports teams 
including the Pittsburgh Pirates, Seattle Mariners and Colorado 
Rockies, the networks are a small but vital piece of a much 
larger swap under discussion between the two companies, the 
paper said.  News Corp. NWSa.N could finalize a deal as early as this 
week to swap its controlling interest in DirecTV Group Inc. 
DTV.N and other assets for Liberty's $11 billion stake in 
News Corp., a source familiar with the matter told Reuters on 
Thursday.  News Corp and Liberty Media were not immediately available 
for comment.
