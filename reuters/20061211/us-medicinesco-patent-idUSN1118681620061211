 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Shares of the Medicines Co. ( MDCO.O ) fell 10 percent on Monday after the U.S. Congress failed to enact a bill that would have helped the company's bid to extend a patent on its flagship drug Angiomax, a blood thinner. 

 Last week the U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill that would have allowed the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to consider patent applications filed unintentionally late. But the Senate adjourned without considering the bill, the company said. The patent office had rejected the company's application to extend its Angiomax patent beyond 2010 because it was not filed on time. The company said it was hopeful that the U.S. Congress would take up a similar bill next year. Medicines Co. shares fell $3.42 to $29.68 in early trade on Nasdaq.
