 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Citigroup, ( C.N ) under pressure to cut costs and boost revenues, said on Monday it had named Robert Druskin as chief operating officer. The move comes as the largest U.S. bank by market capitalization, is facing investor pressure to improve its operating performance. 

 Following are views from analysts: SCOTT ARMIGER, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, CHRISTIANA BANK & TRUST CO.,GREENVILLE, DELAWARE "Maybe this is the catalyst that we were looking for to get this earnings machine moving again. We've owned it since 2001 and its been a disappointment from a performance standpoint. I'm a little surprised about review of costs. I understand Sandy Weill to be quite a cost control chairman and would be surprise they would be out of control. I would be looking for Druskin to ameliorate the revenue side. Maybe the early read is they are a little disappointed in the changes. But it has had a run in last few days."
