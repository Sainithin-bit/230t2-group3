 BERLIN  (Reuters) - Germany has won support from the United 
States and Britain for an initiative to tighten controls on 
hedge funds, a newspaper reported on Monday. 

  The Handelsblatt said Finance Minister Peer Steinbrueck had 
won the backing of U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and 
Britain's finance minister, Gordon Brown, to pursue the 
initiative during Germany's Group of Eight presidency next 
year.  "With the consent of the two most important finance 
countries, the probability rises that we will reach concrete 
decisions," the business daily quoted a confidante of 
Steinbrueck as saying.  Germany takes over the presidency of the Group of Eight 
(G8) industrial nations next year. Berlin plans a G7 finance 
ministers' meeting in Essen on February 9-10, a G8 finance 
ministers' meeting in Potsdam on May 18-19 and a G8 summit in 
the Baltic Sea resort of Heiligendamm on June 6-8.  Steinbrueck's deputy Thomas Mirow would travel to 
Washington this week to discuss details of Germany's concept of 
the initiative, among other issues, with Paulson, Handelsblatt 
said.  A debate over hedge funds and private equity investors 
flared during last year's German election campaign, with 
then-Social Democrat chairman Franz Muentefering famously 
branding such investors as locusts who preyed on German firms.  Muentefering is now the vice chancellor and labor minister 
in Merkel's government.
