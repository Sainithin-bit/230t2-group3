 LONDON  (Reuters) - U.S. retailer Home Depot Inc. ( HD.N ) is 
preparing to spend $100 million on a majority stake in Chinese 
chain HomeWay in a deal that will be unveiled in China this 
week, the Financial Times said on Monday. 

  Citing people close to the deal, the newspaper said the 
move into China's home improvement market was the result of

Yourself stores in northern China, according to the FT.  As for Home Depot, it already operates a large outsourcing 
business in China, with a network of more than 500 suppliers,

products come from the country.
