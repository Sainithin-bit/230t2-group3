 (Reuters) - Krispy Kreme Doughnuts Inc. ( KKD.N ) said it 
expects to post a net loss in third quarter of fiscal 2007, as 
substantial costs associated with legal and regulatory matters 
continue to hurt its results. 

  The doughnut maker expects revenue of about $117 million 
for the third quarter, down from about $129 million posted in 
the third quarter of 2006. The company said the decline 
reflects a lower number of stores, as well as lower sales to 
franchisees by its manufacturing and distribution segment.  In a statement, the company also added that systemwide 
sales would fall about 9 percent in the third quarter, compared 
with the same quarter in 2006, due to about a 17 percent 
decrease in the number of factory stores to 293.  Krispy Kreme said average weekly sales per factory store 
for the third quarter would grow about 16 percent in company 
stores and 12 percent systemwide, compared with 2006 third 
quarter.  Average weekly sales per store would rise about 14 percent 
for company stores and fall about half a percent systemwide, 
for the third quarter compared with the same quarter in 2006, 
the company said.  The company expects systemwide average sales per store to 
decrease slightly while it sees company average sales per store 
rising principally, due to the growth in satellite stores.  In a SEC filing, Krispy Kreme said it was unable to 
finalize its quarterly report for the third quarter of fiscal 
2007, before the filing deadline of December 8, 2006.  (Reporting by Tenzin Pema in Bangalore)
