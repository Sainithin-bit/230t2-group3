 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - A 0.2 percent rise in U.S. industrial output in October was unchanged from what the Federal Reserve initially reported, but October capacity use was slightly lower than first estimated, according to annual revision data the Fed issued on Monday. 

 October industrial production was unchanged from the 0.2 percent increase reported on November 16. Capacity use was revised down to 82.0 percent from an originally reported 82.2 percent. The Fed revised September industrial output to a decline of 0.5 percent from a previously reported 0.6 percent decline. September capacity use was revised to 81.9 percent from 82.1 percent. The Fed revisions left October's industrial production excluding selected high-technology industries unchanged at an increase of 0.1 percent and that for September at a decline of 0.7 percent. Growth in industrial output for the third quarter, compared with the same period a year earlier, was revised downward to 4.0 percent from a previously reported 4.2 percent. The Fed also said the revised full-year 2005 output growth was 3.2 percent, compared with 3.3 percent reported previously.
