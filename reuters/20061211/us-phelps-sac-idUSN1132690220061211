 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Hedge fund SAC Capital has disclosed it has a more than 5 percent stake in mining giant Phelps Dodge Corp. PD.N and wants to block Freeport McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc.'s ( FCX.N ) proposal to buy the company, saying the price is too low, a regulatory filing said. 

 The news came on the same day that the New York Post reported that SAC was seeking a $150-per-share price for the proposed buyout, about 15 percent higher than its agreed price. Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold said in November it had agreed to buy much larger Phelps Dodge for about $26 billion in cash and stock to create the world's largest publicly traded copper company. A spokesman for SAC Capital declined to comment beyond the filing. A Phelps spokesman declined to comment. Freeport-McMoRan was not immediately available for comment. Separately, activist investment fund Atticus Capital, which owns just under 10 percent of Phelps Dodge and earlier this year sought a buyer for the company after having helped sideline its offer to buy Canadian miners Falconbridge and Inco, said it was evaluating the Phelps situation on its own. "We will continue to independently evaluate all available alternatives for Phelps Dodge including Freeport-McMoRan's offer," the spokesman said. SAC filed an ownership reporting document with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday, stating it has acquired a 5.1 percent stake in Phelps Dodge stock. It said in the filing that it planned to vote against the proposed transaction, which it believed would offer few benefits to the combined operation and use Phelps' balance sheet "to fund the purchase in what is essentially a public recapitalization." SAC also said there was unrecognized long-term value in Phelps' shares that would be lost in the deal at Freeport's proposed terms. Freeport had agreed to pay $88 plus 0.67 share of its stock for each Phelps share, which based on Monday's trading levels was worth about $129.31 per share. Freeport shares were off 11 cents at $61.69 while Phelps was up 13 cents at $123.80. (Additional reporting by  Karey Wutkowski  in Washington and  Megan Davies )
