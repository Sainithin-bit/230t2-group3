 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - UnitedHealth Group Inc ( UNH.N ) said on Wednesday that its board had significantly increased the health insurer's stock buyback program. 

 UnitedHealth may now repurchase up to 120 million shares, including about 23 million remaining under a previous buyback program. At Tuesday's closing price of $33, buying back 120 million shares would equate to nearly $4 billion. UnitedHealth bought back 74 million shares in 2009 at a weighted average purchase price of $24.26 each. The company had about 1.15 billion common shares outstanding as of December 31. UnitedHealth's board also authorized an annual dividend of 3 cents per share, to be paid in April. The company paid a 3-cent-per-share dividend last year.
