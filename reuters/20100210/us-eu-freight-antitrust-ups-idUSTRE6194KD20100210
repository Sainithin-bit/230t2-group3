 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - United Parcel Service Inc ( UPS.N ), the world's largest package-delivery service, said on Wednesday it has been contacted by the European Commission, which is probing price fixing in the shipping business. 

 "We received on February 9 a statement of objections from the European Union containing the commission's preliminary view with respect to what they allege is anti-competitive behavior in the freight-forwarding industry," Norman Black, a spokesman for the Atlanta-based company said in an emailed statement. "We intend to vigorously defend ourselves in this proceeding against any allegations of wrong-doing involving UPS," he added. European authorities have charged logistics companies including DHL ( DPWGn.DE ), Panalpina ( PWTN.S ), Kuehne & Nagel ( KNIN.VX ) and DSV ( DSV.CO ) with illegally fixing prices. Officials at UPS's main U.S. rival, FedEx Corp ( FDX.N ) said they had not been contacted by European Commission, or any other regulators, in connection with the investigation.
