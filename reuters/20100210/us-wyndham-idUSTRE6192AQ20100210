 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Wyndham Worldwide Corp ( WYN.N ) posted a better-than-expected quarterly profit on Wednesday, helped by a strong performance and said it was tripling its quarterly dividend, sending shares 2.4 percent higher. 

 Wyndham lifted its dividend to 12 cents per share from its previous level of 4 cents. The increase puts Wyndham's dividend yield at about 2 percent based on its current stock price. High unemployment and reduced corporate spending bruised travel demand during the economic downturn, forcing hotel companies like Wyndham to cut room rates. But travel demand in recent months has improved and Wyndham executives told analysts during a conference call that boosting its dividend was a sign of faith in its business prospects and ability to generate free cash flow. "Our view is that there has been a gradual improvement," CEO Stephen Holmes said in an interview. "The end of the year was better than the beginning of 2009." The franchiser of Days Inn, Ramada and Super 8 hotels reported net income of $73 million, or 40 cents per share, besting analyst expectations of 37 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. A year earlier Wyndham posted a net loss of $1.36 billion, or $7.63 per share, hit by charges linked to its vacation ownership program. Analysts said Wyndham surpassed expectations largely due to  better-than-expected earnings from its timeshare segment. "Outperformance was primarily from the vacation ownership segment as EBITDA was $132 million versus our estimate of $108 million," said FBR Capital Markets analyst Patrick Scholes in a research note. In the fourth quarter, revenue rose to $913 million from $911 million a year earlier. In its hotel group, revenue per available room fell 11.9 percent. Wyndham shares were up 83 cents to $22.05 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The broader S&P 500 index was down 0.4 percent. ECONOMY SEGMENT TO LAG UPSCALE Last week, Starwood Hotels & Resorts ( HOT.N ), which operates the W and St Regis hotels, posted earnings that blew past Wall Street estimates, a sign that demand for top-tier hotels was improving. Marriott International MAR.N is expected to report earnings on Thursday. Wyndham's upscale brands include its Wyndham Hotels and Resorts brand. Its managed hotels in this segment saw revPAR, a fiscal measure of health in the industry, jump 12 percent in January, Holmes told analysts during a conference call. "You may be seeing the return of business travel," Holmes told Reuters in an interview earlier Wednesday morning. The bulk of Wyndham's portfolio is in the economy and mid-scale segments, which Holmes said would lag top-tier hotels in a recovery. "The upper-upscale segment will see a recovery to the middle of 2009," Holmes said in an interview. "The economy segments may be lagging a little bit behind." Wyndham expects to earn between 27 cents and 32 cents per share in the first quarter. Analysts on average expect to company to post earnings of 29 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. In 2010, Wyndham expects revPAR to be flat to down 3 percent for its hotels. It expects to earn between $1.48 and $1.69 per share in 2010. Analysts expect $1.61 for full year earnings, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Wyndham said it would resume share repurchases under an existing $200 million buyback plan. The repurchase program has $157 million in remaining capacity. The timing of buybacks is subject to market conditions. (Reporting by Deepa Seetharaman; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn, John Wallace and  Bernard Orr )
