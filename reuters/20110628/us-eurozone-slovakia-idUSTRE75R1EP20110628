 BRATISLAVA  (Reuters) - The Greek debt crisis should result into debt restructuring if the country's parliament fails to approve a package of fiscal reforms demanded by international lenders, Slovak Finance Minister Ivan Miklos said on Tuesday. 

 "If the fiscal consolidation plan is not approved, the next tranche will not be paid, further money should not be provided and restructuring should be done," Miklos told a news conference. The Greek parliament is expected to vote on the package later this week among uncertainty whether the government will find support for the plan. (Reporting by Martin Santa, writing by Jan Lopatka)
