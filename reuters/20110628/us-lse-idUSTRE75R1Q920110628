 LONDON  (Reuters) - The London Stock Exchange ( LSE.L ) will proceed as planned with this week's vote on its takeover of Canadian group TMX ( X.TO ) and is confident shareholders will back the deal, chief executive Xavier Rolet said on Tuesday. 

 "Yes, absolutely," Rolet told Reuters when asked if he was confident the deal will win shareholder backing on Thursday. There was no reason why the vote should not go ahead as planned, Rolet said. He would not comment on whether the LSE and TMX will need to offer more sweeteners to get the deal through. The LSE, which has made a friendly bid for TMX Group, faces a rival offer from the Maple Group, a consortium of Canadian financial institutions and pension funds.
