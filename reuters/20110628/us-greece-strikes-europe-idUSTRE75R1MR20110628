 (Reuters) - Public disgruntlement over austerity -- including curbs on early retirement, tax rises and cuts in benefits and wages -- has erupted into strikes and protests. Here are some details of unrest around Europe: 

 * GREECE -- Greek unions promised to fill the streets of Athens on Tuesday at the start of a two-day strike to protest against painful austerity measures demanded by international lenders as the price for more financial aid. -- Thousands of Greeks have taken to the streets in recent weeks belonging to ADEDY, the public sector union representing half a million civil servants, and GSEE, which represents 2 million private sector workers. -- Protesters besieged parliament during a vote of confidence in the cabinet last week, shouting insults at politicians and shining hundreds of green laser lights at the building and at police. They held up a mock gallows with several nooses. -- Greek protesters threw petrol bombs and clashed with police on June 15 at buildings housing the finance ministry. -- On June 9 workers on the Athens metro and bus service staged a strike. Staff from companies earmarked for privatization also held a protest march. BRITAIN - The government and unions said talks over public sector pension reforms made progress on June 27 but planned strikes by up to 750,000 teachers and civil servants will still go ahead on Thursday, closing schools and government offices and potentially disrupting airports and ports. -- Public sector workers are already facing a wage freeze and more than 300,000 job losses as the government cuts spending. For some in the unions, the pension reform was the last straw and they have vowed to stage coordinated national action in what could be Britain's worst labor stoppages for decades. SPAIN - Dozens of "los indignados" (the indignant), demonstrating against high unemployment and economic stagnation, camped outside parliament to protest as lawmakers debated amendments to the Socialist government's wage reform bill, meant to make the economy more competitive. The reforms were decreed into law by Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero's cabinet on June 10 and have been criticized by both unions and business groups. -- On June 15, politicians in the Catalonia region of northeastern Spain were forced to enter parliament by helicopter or under police escort as protests grew against a planned 10 percent cut in public spending. - Last month, tens of thousands of demonstrators, angry over unemployment and austerity measures, packed Madrid's Puerta del Sol square before local elections. Demonstrators have filled Spain's city plazas, outraged over government austerity measures, marking a shift after years of patience over a long economic slump. -- At night the crowds on the square have swelled to up to 30,000 people. Hundreds of protesters camp out overnight and occupy the plaza during the day. FRANCE - Solidarity with "los indignados" in Madrid has already inspired several dozen French youths to spend nights camped out at the Place de la Bastille, the Paris square where a jail was torn down during the 1789 French Revolution.
