 AMSTERDAM  (Reuters) - European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet said on Tuesday he was looking at a French proposal for rolling over Greek debt but signaled the debt crisis had not derailed plans for a July interest rate rise. 

 "You know as far as we are concerned, the governing council of the ECB, that we are in a very strong vigilance mode," Trichet told a news conference held with Korea's central bank governor. The phrase "strong vigilance" has regularly been deployed to signal a rate hike at the next monthly meeting. The euro rose in response. When asked about the French proposal to roll over some private-held Greek debt, Trichet told reporters the ECB was looking at this but added: "It is the responsibility of the governments ... it is being examined, there are several proposals that are being examined. We will see when we have the results of this examination but again we are observing what's going on." Trichet said that the ECB governing council had not changed its stance in the light of the French proposal, under which private bondholders would reinvest half of the proceeds of maturing Greek debt in new 30-year bonds paying 5.5 percent interest plus a bonus linked to Greece's GDP growth rate. "The position of the ECB governing council has not changed. We will see what the precise proposal presented is and what kind of judgment is made by the governments themselves, because it is their own responsibility and then we will have our own position." Greece's parliament will vote on Wednesday and Thursday on a deeply unpopular austerity package upon which new funding from the EU and IMF depends. Without that, Greece faces near immediate default. If the package is voted through, attention will then switch to putting together a second rescue package for Greece of about the same magnitude as the 110 billion euro bailout agreed last year. The new program would involve some 30 billion euros in private sector participation via a "voluntary" rollover of maturing debt, a similar sum from privatization revenues and an expected 55 billion euros in new official funding. Bank of Korea chief Kim Choong-soo said Asia expected the crisis to be contained. "I assume they will have the ability to do so. These problems will be solved in a reasonably appropriate way," he said. (Reporting by  Gilbert Kreijger , writing by Mike Peacock)
