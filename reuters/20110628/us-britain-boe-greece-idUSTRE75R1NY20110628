 LONDON  (Reuters) - Bank of England Governor Mervyn King said on Tuesday he was making contingency plans for a Greek sovereign default, and reiterated that banks needed to be more transparent about their exposure. 

 King's remarks to a British parliamentary committee follow worries he expressed at a news conference on Friday, when he warned that Greece's problem was solvency, not liquidity, and that temporary cash injections would not fix it. "What we're doing is to say there is sufficient concern in the market about the possibility of (a Greek) default for us to think about contingency plans and the consequences of this event," he told lawmakers. "I certainly think that in present circumstances more transparency about sovereign exposures would help," he said. Without transparency, there was a risk of a broad-based loss in confidence in European banks in the event of a Greek default, King said, although better mechanisms were now in place than when the credit crunch first bit in 2007 and interbank lending dried up. "Even knowing the mechanical links ... between banks doesn't guarantee that there can't be a sudden loss of confidence in which those who fund banks decide to step back and say: 'Look, we have no idea which European bank is exposed really to another European bank, and therefore we just stop funding European banks'," he said. Greece's government is struggling to find public backing for the spending cuts and tax rises needed to service the high interest on its debt. King declined to say how likely he thought a Greek default was, but he noted that the BoE's Financial Stability Report last week suggested that financial markets gave an 80 percent probability to some kind of default. French President Nicolas Sarkozy -- whose country's banks are more directly exposed to Greek debt than Britain's -- said on Monday that French banks had reached a draft agreement with authorities on a voluntary rollover for maturing bonds.
