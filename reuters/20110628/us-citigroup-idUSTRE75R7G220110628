 (Reuters) - Citigroup, the third-largest U.S. bank by assets, has told government officials that about 3,400 of the customers whose credit-card information was hacked have suffered about $2.7 million in losses, the Wall Street Journal reported. 

 However, Citigroup has said its customers are not liable for any losses resulting from "any unauthorized use of their accounts." The company disclosed the losses when briefing government officials this week about the breach, the Journal said citing people familiar with the matter. Last week, the company said a total of 360,083 North American Citigroup credit card accounts were affected by the cyber attack in May, the latest in a spate of attacks in recent months targeting high-profile companies like Sony, Google Inc and Lockheed Martin. Citigroup had said that "data critical to commit fraud was not compromised." The company could not be immediately reached for comment.
