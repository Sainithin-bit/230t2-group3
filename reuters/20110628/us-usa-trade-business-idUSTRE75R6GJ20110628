 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The U.S. Chamber of Commerce on Tuesday urged Republicans and Democrats to support what it called a "reasonable compromise" to move long-delayed trade deals with South Korea, Panama and Colombia. 

 "For members of Congress who care about American jobs, this is a moment of truth," the business group's president, Thomas Donohue, said in a statement. "I urge members of both parties to seize a reasonable compromise and move the trade agenda forward. The time to act is now." Some Republicans have objected to the plan to include a renewal of retraining program for workers who have lost their jobs because of trade into the implementing legislation for the South Korean trade deal.
