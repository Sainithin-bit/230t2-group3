 HOUSTON  (Reuters) - Valero Energy Corp ( VLO.N ) on Saturday began shutting several units, including a gasoline-making fluid catalytic cracking unit, for planned work at its 156,000 barrels-per-day (bpd) McKee refinery in Sunray, Texas, the company said in a filing with Texas pollution regulators. 
 The filing with the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality said a reformer and a sulfur recovery unit also would be shut down for work between Saturday and Monday. (Reporting By Kristen Hays; editing by Gunna Dickson)
