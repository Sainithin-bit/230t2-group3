 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp ( 7203.T ) will recall about 2.77 million vehicles worldwide, including the Prius hybrid car, due to problems with the steering mechanism and the hybrid system water pump. 
 Toyota will recall 13 models sold in Japan between August 2000 and January 2012, it said in a filing with Japan's transport ministry. Some 1.5 million of the recalls are of cars sold in Japan. The announcement comes a month after Toyota recalled more than 7.4 million vehicles worldwide for faulty power window switches that are a potential fire hazard, the biggest single recall since Ford pulled 8 million vehicles off the road in 1996.
