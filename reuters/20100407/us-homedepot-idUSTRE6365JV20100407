 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Home Depot Inc ( HD.N ) Chief Executive Frank Blake was awarded $9.9 million of total compensation in 2009, about 6.9 percent more than a year ago, according to a regulatory filing on Wednesday. 

 The world's largest home improvement retailer moved to tie most of Blake's pay to performance in 2007 after criticism that it overpaid former CEO Robert Nardelli, who resigned under pressure after six years at the helm. Nardelli had benefited from accelerated vesting of restricted and deferred shares under his employment agreement. According to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Blake's total compensation included about $1.0 million salary, about $6.5 million of stock and option awards, about $2.1 million of non-equity incentive plan compensation, and $266,194 of other compensation. Earlier this year, Home Depot reported its first quarterly same-store rise in nearly four years and gave an upbeat full-year forecast as customers began bigger renovation projects. Compensation includes salary, bonus, stock and option awards, incentive pay, and other compensation, including perks. Some compensation experts and companies themselves may compute executive pay differently. Home Depot will hold its annual meeting on May 20 in Atlanta.
