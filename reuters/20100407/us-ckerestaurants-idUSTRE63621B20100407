 * Says no assurance offer could lead to superior one 

 * Saysno changes in recommendation on pending merger (Reuters) - CKE Restaurants Inc CKR.N said it received an alternative takeover offer, which could lead to a superior proposal, sending shares of the fast food chain up 7 percent in pre-market trade. CKE, owner of the Hardee's and Carl's Jr. hamburger chains, however, had in February agreed to be bought by Thomas H. Lee Partners for $619 million cash and had 40 days to seek superior offers. That "go shop" provision expired on Tuesday. On Tuesday, Porter Orlin, a New York-based investment manager wrote a letter to CKE Restaurants' board and management, expressing strong dissatisfaction with private equity firm THL Partners' plan to take the company private. The company has not changed its recommendation on its pending merger with affiliates of Thomas H. Lee Partners, CKE Restaurants said in a statement. Shares of Carpinteria, California-based CKE were up $0.75 at $11.83 Wednesday in trading before the bell. They closed at $11.08 Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange.
