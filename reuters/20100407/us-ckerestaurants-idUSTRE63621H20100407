 NEW YORK/BANGALORE  (Reuters) - Private equity firm Apollo Management is the alternative bidder for CKE Restaurants Inc CKR.N, rivaling an existing bid by Thomas H. Lee Partners THL.UL, two sources briefed on the situation said on Wednesday. 

 CKE, owner of the Hardee's and Carl's Jr. hamburger chains, said earlier on Wednesday that an unnamed bidder had made an alternative offer to its deal to be taken private by THL, but it did not identify the bidder. Apollo declined comment. CKE declined to comment on the bidder's identity. When the fast food chain agreed in February to be bought by the private equity firm for $619 million cash, it had 40 days to seek superior offers. [ID:nSGE61P0J7] That "go shop" period expired on Wednesday at 12:01 p.m. EDT. Under the pact with THL, CKE can provide information and hold discussions with the new bidder until 12:01 p.m. ET on April 27. Shares of CKE hit a high of $11.99 before settling somewhat to close at $11.81, up 73 cents, or 6.6 percent. THL's offer values CKE at $11.05 a share. A superior deal is, however, uncertain. The new offer did not include evidence of a committed financing and is subject to several conditions, CKE Restaurants said in a statement. "Given the challenges of CKE in California and solvency issues with their Hardee's franchisees, any potential bidder relying on outside financing may find it difficult to secure the necessary funds," Global Hunter Securities analyst Conrad Lyon told Reuters. "So it is likely far from certain that the new bid will prove superior to THL's offer," he said. Sales at CKE have been hurt by high unemployment rates in its core markets, including California, and aggressive discounting at its larger rivals. CKE posted a 4.1 percent drop in sales for the period ended March 22. Its year-to-date sales fell 4.2 percent. CKE, which declined to give more details on the new bidder citing confidentiality agreements, said it has not changed its recommendation on its pending merger with affiliates of THL. On Tuesday, Porter Orlin, a New York-based investment manager holding almost 2.3 million shares in CKE, wrote a letter to the company expressing strong dissatisfaction with THL's plan to take the company private.
