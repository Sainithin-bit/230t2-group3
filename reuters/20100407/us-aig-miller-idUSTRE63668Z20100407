 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - American International Group Inc ( AIG.N ) named Henry Miller, chairman and co-founder of boutique investment bank Miller Buckfire & Co, to its board, according to a company statement on Wednesday. 

 The insurer said Miller, 64, is also chairman and chief executive officer of Marblegate Asset Management, a business affiliated with Miller Buckfire. The U.S. government owns 79.9 percent of AIG, after committing more than $180 billion of taxpayer funds to the insurer. Last week, the U.S. Treasury named two former executives of E*Trade Financial and Electronic Data Systems to AIG's board. Separately, earlier on Wednesday AIG said it will pay $9 million to settle an Ohio antitrust lawsuit accusing it of conspiring to fix commercial casualty insurance prices.
