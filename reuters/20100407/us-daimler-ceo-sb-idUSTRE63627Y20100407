 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - German premium car maker Daimler ( DAIGn.DE ) could not have financed the third generation of its small car brand Smart alone, CEO Dieter Zetsche said in Brussels on Wednesday. 

 "We were on the lookout for a partner for Smart and we needed a partner for a second, smaller four-cylinder engine series," he said, adding that the problem could now be solved through the partnership with Renault ( RENA.PA ) and Nissan ( 7201.T ). A small car alliance with German peer BMW ( BMWG.DE ) was impossible given the different architectures, Zetsche said. The cooperation with Renault and Nissan also would bring Daimler's premium brand Mercedes closer to its 10 percent operating margin goal, he added. (Reporting by  Hendrik Sackmann )
