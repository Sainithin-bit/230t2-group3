 BEIJING  (Reuters) - General Motors Corp's ( GM.N ) joint venture in China is recalling 7,056 Buick cars in the country due to front brake problems, Xinhua news agency reported, citing China's top quality watchdog. 

 Shanghai GM, a joint venture with top Chinese car maker Shanghai Automotive Co ( 600104.SS ) will contact the buyers and repair the problematic parts free of charge, the report said late on Sunday. The problem was found in some Buick LaCrosse sedans made between March 10, 2006 and March 22, 2007. "The problem may cause vehicle vibrations in a minority of cases, affecting manipulation and comfort," the General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine said. The joint venture, which also produces the Cadillac and Chevrolet cars, was China's No. 1 passenger vehicle producer last year, with sales of 413,400.
