 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Single-family home builder M/I Homes Inc. ( MHO.N ) said on Monday it has sold some Florida land to reduce debt, and is exiting the West Palm Beach market in that state, sending shares up 3 percent in early trading. 

 The land sold for about $82 million and represents 3,700 lots, or more than a fifth of the company's 16,767 lots at the end of the third quarter, M/I said. In West Palm Beach, the market it is exiting, its assets included about 500 lots in four communities. Tighter credit along with problems in the subprime mortgage market have dampened demand for homes in the United States, leading to cancellations, lower home prices and rising inventory of unsold homes. Sales of new U.S. homes are running at their lowest rate in 12 years, the government said on Friday. To weather the downturn, home builders have been selling land, reducing their debt and holding on to the cash they generate to shore up balance sheets. Toll Brothers Inc. ( TOL.N ) and Lennar Corp. ( LEN.N ) are among other companies selling land in recent weeks. "The cash generated from these land sales, combined with our year end home deliveries, will significantly reduce our bank debt," M/I Homes CEO Robert Schottenstein said in a statement. Columbus, Ohio-based M/I said it will record an $80 million charge in the fourth quarter to reflect land impairment charges, and said further charges are likely. The company also expects a $50 million cash refund in the second quarter of 2008. M/I shares were trading up 30 cents to $10.40 on the New York Stock Exchange. Counting Monday's advance, the shares have lost about 72 percent of their value over the past year, compared with a 55 percent drop by the Dow Jones home building index in that same timespan.
