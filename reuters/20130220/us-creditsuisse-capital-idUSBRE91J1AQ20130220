 ZURICH  (Reuters) - Credit Suisse ( CSGN.VX ) said on Wednesday it would redeem $1.5 billion in Tier 1 Capital notes next month as part of measures to manage its capital to comply with tougher regulation. 
 The bank said in a statement it had decided to redeem $1.525 billion 7.9 percent Tier 1 Capital Notes on March 28. It said it would pay a redemption price per note of $25, plus $0.07132 per note in interest. Under strict new capital rules drawn up after the crisis, Switzerland has encouraged its two biggest banks, UBS ( UBSN.VX ) and Credit Suisse, to shore up their financial strength. Last October the bank said it would cut an extra 1 billion Swiss francs of costs, including axing more jobs, as part of efforts to bolster its profits and capital position.
