 (Reuters) - Wall Street was set to enjoy a positive return to trading on Tuesday after the Labor Day holiday, according to stock index futures. 

 At 4:50 a.m. EDT, futures for the Dow Jones, S&P 500 and Nasdaq were up between 1 and 1.1 percent. Spot gold rose above $1,000 an ounce to its highest level since March 2008 as the dollar extended losses against the euro, traders said. The FTSEurofirst 300  .FTEU3  index of top European shares was up 0.5 percent at 981.03 points, on course for an 11-month closing high, with miners among the biggest gainers. Asian markets rose, with China's benchmark Shanghai Composite  .SSEC  closing 1.7 percent higher amid continued signs of government support. The U.S. Congress returns from a month-long recess to resume work on a landmark overhaul of the $2.5 trillion U.S. healthcare system. No major U.S. companies were due to report results. Kraft Foods KFT.N will be in focus after its 10.2 billion pound ($16.7 billion) approach to British confectioner Cadbury CBRY.L was rejected. Economic data due on Tuesday includes the U.S. employment trend index for August at 10 a.m. EDT and July consumer credit at 3 p.m. EDT. U.S. stocks closed higher on Friday as investors focused on the bright side of a mixed payrolls report that showed smaller-than-expected job cuts in August, although the unemployment rate hit a 26-year high. U.S. Treasury debt prices rose in Asian trade on Tuesday, edging up after the Labor Day holiday but cautious ahead of a sale of three-year notes.
