 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. retailers increased their hiring in July to the highest level in 2009, a research group said on Tuesday, indicating a continued if slow recovery in employment. 

 Kronos Inc, a workforce management company, said its Retail Labor Index rose to 2.99 percent in July from 2.88 percent in June. Seasonally adjusted hiring rose to about 42,000 out of 1.4 million applications. "We believe this stabilization and tentative recovery in the index signals the beginning of stabilization in the overall U.S. economy," said Robert Yerex, chief economist at Kronos. While other economic indicators increasingly point to a recovery in the United States from the deepest economic slowdown since the Great Depression, the pick-up in employment is expected to be long and timid. The index, made public for the first time on Tuesday, measures hirings, job applications and retention rate at about 9 percent of the companies in the U.S. retail sector and monthly comparable data goes back to August 2006, Yerex said. The index's highest reading was reached in October 2006 at 7.1 percent, while its low hit 2.75 percent in January. The 42,000 hirings were the most since December, when retailers hired 50,000 people. U.S. unemployment has risen to levels not seen since 1983 as the world's biggest economy struggles to exit a recession that began in December 2007.
