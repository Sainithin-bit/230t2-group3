 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Moody's Investors Service on Tuesday said it may cut the debt rating on Kraft Foods Inc, citing its $16.7 billion takeover bid for Cadbury Plc. 

 Cadbury, known for its chocolate bars, has rejected the cash and stock bid. "Given Cadbury's rejection of Kraft's initial proposal on valuation concerns, we expect that any follow-up offer by Kraft would likely involve a higher price," Moody's said in a statement. Moody's said it is also concerned that Kraft will need to increase its use of leverage for the deal as it raises its offer. Kraft's credit measures are already weak for its Baa2 rating, Moody's said. A Baa2 rating is two steps above junk status. Any downgrade would likely be limited to one notch, Moody's said, which would keep Kraft in the investment-grade ranks. In making a decision on the rating, Moody's said it will focus on any increased leverage from the acquisition, integration plans, cost synergies and the combined company's operating strategy and financial policy. Cadbury's Baa2 rating remains unchanged but will be revisited if a formal bid is made for the company, Moody's said on Monday. (Reporting by  Dena Aubin ; Editing by Dan Grebler)
