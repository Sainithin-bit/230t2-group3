 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - AOL Inc, the Internet unit of Time Warner Inc, said on Tuesday it has appointed former Yahoo Inc executive Brad Garlinghouse as president of its Web and mobile communications group. 

 Garlinghouse, who was most recently an advisor at venture capital firm Silver Lake Partners, will also take on a role heading up AOL's Silicon Valley operations from its Mountain View, California campus. He will serve as the West coast lead for AOL Ventures, the company's venture capital arm headed by Jon Brod. Before joining Silver Lake, Garlinghouse spent nearly six years at Yahoo where he oversaw the Internet company's communications and community products. Garlinghouse's new group includes AOL's e-mail, instant messaging and mobile communications. He will report directly to AOL chief executive Tim Armstrong. The former Yahoo executive is the latest senior addition by Armstrong as he builds a management team ahead of AOL's spin-off as an independent company later this year. Last month AOL named former Time Warner Cable executive Arthur Minson as its chief financial officer. (Reporting by  Yinka Adegoke ; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman)
