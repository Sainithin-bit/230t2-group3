 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Carlyle Group CYL.UL is in talks to buy AlpInvest Partners, one of the world's largest private equity investors with more than 40 billion euros ($52.4 billion) under management, a source familiar with the situation said on Wednesday. 

 Buying AlpInvest, which manages the private equity investments for Dutch asset managers APG and PGGM Investments, would help Carlyle diversify its businesses as it prepares to follow rivals Blackstone Group LP ( BX.N ) and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co ( KKR.N ) to a public listing. Carlyle, one of the world's largest buyout firms with $97.7 billion under management and investments in companies such as Dunkin' Brands, has been considering an initial public offering for years and could file papers to go public late next year, a source previously told Reuters. "On a broad level you can understand the motivation," said Josh Lerner, a Harvard Business School professor specializing in private equity. "Private equity has many virtues but one of the downsides is that it tends to be a pretty cyclical business -- it has a boom-bust flavor." Lerner said as a result, the private equity firms that have successfully gone public have sought to limit their dependence on private equity by diversifying their product lines. "You can easily see that were you a private equity group thinking of going public some day, you might see diversifying as an attractive thing to do, particularly into a business like asset management, which tends to offer reasonably steady cash flow," said Lerner. Blackstone -- Carlyle's rival and the poster child for private equity firms going public -- has diversified broadly, with large real estate funds, an M&A and restructuring advisory business and a credit platform. Blackstone's Chief Operating Officer Tony James recently said on a conference call that Blackstone is often misperceived to be just a private equity firm. [nN17219990] "Private equity is a good business, but it's not our biggest business," James said at the time. "It's not our most profitable business and it's not our fastest growing business. So by almost any definition, private equity is not our best business and not even our core business." A deal for AlpInvest could be reached in the first quarter, the source who spoke to Reuters said, declining to be named because the talks are not public. A sale of the firm has been in the works for several months, according to media reports. APG and PGGM each own 50 percent of AlpInvest. APG is the asset manager for ABP, the world's third-largest sovereign pension fund. PGGM is the asset manager for PFZW, the pension fund for the Dutch care and welfare sector. Carlyle declined to comment on the news, which was first reported by Bloomberg. AlpInvest was not immediately available for comment.
