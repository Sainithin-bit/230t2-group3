 PARIS  (Reuters) - The World Bank has frozen financing for the Ivory Coast, the bank's president Robert Zoellick said on Wednesday, as the international community puts pressure on Laurent Gbagbo to step down as president. 

 "They have already been frozen," Zoellick told reporters, asked about World Bank loans to Ivory Coast, which is locked in a standoff over a contested presidential election result. Zoellick was in Paris for meetings with President Nicolas Sarkozy and Economy Minister Christine Lagarde. (Reporting by Yann Le Guernigou)
