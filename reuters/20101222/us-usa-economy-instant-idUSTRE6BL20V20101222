 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Economic growth was a touch higher than previously estimated in the third quarter, but below expectations as a rise in the pace of inventory accumulation was offset by downward revisions to consumer spending, a government report showed on Wednesday. 

 KEY POINTS: * Gross domestic product growth was revised up to an annualized rate of 2.6 percent from 2.5 percent * Economists had expected GDP growth to be revised up to a 2.8 percent pace * The economy expanded at a 1.7 percent rate in the second quarter COMMENTS: ZACH PANDL, ECONOMIST, NOMURA SECURITIES INTERNATIONAL, NEW YORK: "It was relatively close to the last estimate, but the composition of growth is less favorable than when they last reported it. In particular, the revised estimates show more inventory building and less consumer spending, and that's not really what we are looking for. What you'd like to see is accelerating consumer spending, accelerating investment and less GDP growth coming from the inventory channel. "This data is a bit old, and says from June to September we weren't seeing that more favorable type of growth. The question is, is that likely to pick up in the fourth quarter and I think the early evidence is encouraging. The more recent data suggests we're seeing reasonably healthy retail sales growth, pretty healthy investment spending, some growth in employment, so maybe the core growth or final sales growth is starting to accelerate in the fourth quarter." JANE CARON, CHIEF ECONOMIC STRATEGIST, DWIGHT ASSET MANAGEMENT, BURLINGTON, VERMONT: "The number came in much weaker than expected. A lot of us were looking for about 3 percent, we came in at 2.6 percent. Service consumption is where the downward revision came from. Weakness in the third quarter is not a concern for our economic outlook, in fact it bodes positively for the 4th quarter -- our forecast is for real GDP, for the fourth quarter we're forecasting 3.5 percent. For 2011 we are forecasting 3.5 percent growth." TIM GHRISKEY, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, SOLARIS ASSET MANAGEMENT, BEDFORD HILLS, NEW YORK: "I saw sort of a little bit of a negative reaction here in the futures to the GDP number. We are sort of splitting hairs here, it is history and these are very slight differences and it literally could be rounding errors. We just don't see this as a market moving event here. Clearly the economy continues to improve and grow but at a slow, modest pace and that is restraining employment growth and a recovery in the housing market. "Again, slowly but surely the economic improvement will translate into jobs and will translate into a better environment for housing. Clearly, though, this recovery is going to be extended. On the positive side that keeps the Fed away from raising interest rates and hopefully keeps interest rates at a modest level which should encourage the creation of growth. The GDP deflator was below expectations and that was certainly a positive here, but we don't see this as a market moving number."
