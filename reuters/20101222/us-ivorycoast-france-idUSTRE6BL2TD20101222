 PARIS  (Reuters) - France is backing sanctions to resolve the crisis in Ivory Coast, having ruled out a messy military intervention that would jeopardize thousands of French citizens living in the former colony. 

 As a major business partner with 600 companies and 13,000 of its nationals in the country, France wants to retain political and economic influence without appearing to interfere. Aside from urging Laurent Gbagbo to quit, Paris initially took a back seat after the November 28 election in which the incumbent is refusing to accept defeat. But President Nicolas Sarkozy lost his patience on Friday, denouncing Gbagbo's stand as scandalous and demanding he resign fast or face sanctions. Fears are growing that the dispute between Gbagbo and rival Alassane Ouattara -- internationally recognized as the election winner -- could bring about a return to civil war. "The French position is co-ordinated with the international community," government spokesman Francois Baroin said. "France is expressing itself because we are a Security Council member and have 13,000 people on the ground." After weeks of diplomatic efforts to persuade Gbagbo to go, European Union countries have agreed to impose a travel ban on Gbagbo, his wife and several close allies. Further international financial sanctions are likely. Sanctions aside, however, France is limited in what it can do openly. Gbagbo blames Paris for supporting the north in the 2002-03 civil war that split Ivory Coast in two. He has played the anti-French card, labeling Ouattara the West's man and himself as a defender against foreign interference. "International organizations are working on the directives of France," Gbagbo spokesman Alain Toussaint told Reuters this week. "France has a gripe with Gbagbo and will do what it can to get him out. French policy is causing the problem." ARMY WOULD BE PR DISASTER With so many expatriates in Ivory Coast, Paris cannot appear too bellicose. It is anxious to avoid French people becoming targets as in 2004 when militiamen hunted down its citizens, forcing the French army to evacuate them from rooftops. On Wednesday, Paris told its nationals to leave Ivory Coast, where 50 people have been killed in street violence. France has about 950 troops stationed in Ivory Coast supporting a U.N. peacekeeping force, but involvement by its army would be a public relations disaster and has been completely ruled out in the short-term. "Gbagbo is a man who is holding to power by using the military and armed militia against public will," said Josselin de Rohan, who heads the senate's foreign affairs committee. "We can't accept this state, but we are no longer in an era where we can send two paratroop regiments to restore order. That's not what we will do," he told Reuters. Neither side shows any sign of backing down in the world's top cocoa grower, with Ouattara's claim of victory backed by the U.N. Security Council and the outside world, and Gbagbo supported by the army. After meeting Sarkozy on Wednesday, World Bank chief Robert Zoellick added pressure by announcing the bank had frozen loans to Ivory Coast and saying he was talking to African leaders about doing the same. "Gbagbo doesn't have an endless treasury and relies financially on the outside," said de Rohan. "The sanctions that are adapted to the situation will hopefully lead to a peaceful departure of Gbagbo. It depends on him, but if he sheds blood he will be responsible ... If he attacks the French then there will be retaliation." FRANCE'S AFRICA POLICY UNCLEAR Sarkozy's Africa policy has put him in a difficult position. Prior to his election in 2007, he made it clear he wanted to break with France's old way of doing business in Africa -- a blend of post-colonial corruption and patronage known as "Francafrique" that suited dictators and Paris alike. As part of that call he advocated better governance and transparency, but as crises escalated in Chad, Gabon and Guinea, old ways have resurfaced. "At a practical level what can they do? It's perceived that Sarkozy has trashed the credibility of his French-African policy, making it hard for him to be considered an honest broker," a Paris-based Africa expert said this week. "Sarkozy made a point of saying he spoke to Gbagbo and Ouattara," he added. "He might try to broker a deal, but the French could find it more convenient to shelter behind the European Union and United Nations." Economically, France can ill afford to let the situation get out of hand. It is Ivory Coast's No. 2 economic partner and it accounts for quarter of all foreign investment in the country.
