 ABU DHABI  (Reuters) - BP ( BP.L ) Chief Executive Tony Hayward has met with representatives of the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA), one of the world's largest sovereign wealth funds, a UAE official source said on Wednesday. 

 The oil major, grappling with a devastating oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, is looking for investors to help fend off any potential takeover attempts, a UAE source said on Tuesday. Hayward presented "options" to ADIA in the meeting on Wednesday, the official source said, but was unable to give further details. ADIA, the UAE's main sovereign wealth fund, was not immediately available for comment. (Reporting by  Amena Bakr ; Additional reporting by Dinesh Nair; Editing by Dinesh Nair)
