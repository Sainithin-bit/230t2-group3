 LONDON  (Reuters) - Europe named 91 banks taking part in a probe into the health of its banking system -- including many regional banks where markets suspect most of the sore spots -- as it seeks to restore confidence in the sector. 

 The banks -- ranging from Germany's Deutsche Bank AG to Malta's Bank of Valletta -- comprise 65 percent of the European banking sector, the Committee of European Banking Supervisors (CEBS) said Wednesday. "The exercise is being conducted on a bank-by-bank basis using commonly agreed macroeconomic scenarios (baseline and adverse for 2010 and 2011," London-based CEBS said in a document published on its website.
