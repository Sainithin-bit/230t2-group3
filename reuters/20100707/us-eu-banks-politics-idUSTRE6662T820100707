 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - With markets unconvinced that stress tests on 100 European banks will be stringent enough, policymakers are carefully balancing secrecy and disclosure. 

 German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero in particular -- markets are most concerned about the Spanish and German banking systems -- must carefully manage expectations to keep any shocks to a minimum. There is a growing acknowledgement that what might be perceived as the most reassuring outcome on July 23 -- all of the 100 or so banks passing -- could very well leave markets even more skeptical about the quality and depth of the tests. The alternative is one or more banks failing, but that would likely exacerbate the uncertainty and could provoke exactly what policymakers want to avoid -- a full-scale banking crisis. "The market is so convinced that there are issues in the banking system that if the results don't show that some banks are severely undercapitalized, it will be confirmation in itself that the tests have not gone far enough," said Nicolas Veron, a senior fellow at Breugel, a Brussels-based think tank. "That's not just market prejudice," he said. "There is plenty of anecdotal and other evidence that some banks are in severe trouble, particularly with their lending behavior." Merkel and Zapatero's strategy will be key. That may involve insisting that a high degree of detail on how the tests were conducted and what was measured is provided ahead of the July 23 disclosure date so that there is clarity rather than a risk of confusion on the day. In that regard, the publication of the results, to be made by the Committee of European Banking Supervisors (CEBS) in London, should mirror the way the United States handled the results of its banking stress tests last year, analysts say. "You need a lot of market savvy and coordination to make sure that the interplay of rumors and leaks and surprises doesn't result in a big rise in market volatility," said Veron. "In a way, it will be a test of the collective professionalism of Europe's financial policymakers," he said, and by extension the leaders of those European countries where the risk of problems being exposed is greatest. "The U.S. authorities treated the management of expectations and disclosure itself very skillfully. That's a point of reference against which Europe will be measured." "OVER-EXPOSURE?" Spain has to an extent been managing expectations since a European Union summit on June 17, when EU-wide stress tests were formally agreed. From the start, Madrid pushed for the results to be made public on a bank-by-bank basis, something Germany and other EU member states were originally reluctant to do. French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde has also been at the forefront of those trying to provide clarity, announcing last weekend that the test results would be published on July 23 and promising that the criteria would be known in advance. "You will see that the banks in Europe are solid and healthy," she told reporters, adding when asked about French banks: "I'm not worried about my banks." Sources have told Reuters that CEBS will outline its methodology for the tests on Wednesday and could also provide details of those banks which are participating, although it is still not clear which German banks will take part. The tests are expected to include scenarios on the expected impact of possible write-downs of euro zone sovereign bond holdings, and will vary for banks in different countries since country-risk profiles differ widely, the sources said. The greatest risk appears to attain to Germany, not just because of the perceived lending exposure of some of its banks, but because of its reluctance to commit to the same levels of stress-test transparency as others, and the fact that Merkel's coalition government is already under severe strain. In an analysis of the potential outcome of the tests, assuming the application of stresses such as lower than expected GDP growth and a 10 percent decline in property prices, Swiss bank UBS identified Germany and Spain as two of the major risks. "We believe a stress outcome in the Spanish market could be substantially greater than some other markets," the bank said in a 30-page study that examined multiple scenarios. For Spain, with nearly 20 percent unemployment, slow growth and a high budget deficit, the added pressure of poor test results could prove debilitating for Zapatero's government. And for Germany, the risks may not only come from within, but from its exposure to other countries as its banking system is so large and so widely tapped into by other, weaker states. "Different banking systems have very different amounts of exposure to potentially challenged economies," UBS said. "The extent of the German system's exposure to other economies is particularly evident."
