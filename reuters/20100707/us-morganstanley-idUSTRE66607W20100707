 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Copia Capital, a utility and energy hedge fund, is breaking away from Morgan Stanley's ( MS.N ) FrontPoint Partners unit to operate independently, the Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday, citing people familiar with the matter. 

 FrontPoint will invest money with Copia following the move, but will no longer provide services for the fund, the paper said. Morgan Stanley declined to comment. (Reporting by  Martinne Geller  and  Steve Eder )
