 HOUSTON  (Reuters) - It will take 3 days for BP Plc to hook up a new collection vessel that will double its oil-siphoning capacity, the top U.S. official overseeing the spill cleanup said on Wednesday. 

 Coast Guard Admiral Thad Allen said that a relief well that is expected to plug the blown-out Macondo well is 15 feet from the side of the wellbore. But Allen stuck to his mid-August estimate as the time when the well will be sealed. (Reporting by Kristen Hays, Editing by Sandra Maler)
