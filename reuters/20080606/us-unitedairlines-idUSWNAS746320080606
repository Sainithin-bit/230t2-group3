 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - UAL Corp's United Airlines said on Friday it reached agreement with the Association of Flight Attendants on a one-time opportunity for eligible flight attendants to voluntarily leave the company. 

 The program will be available for up to 600 attendants. Those who are at least 45 years old and have at least 15 years of flight attendant service with the company as of August 1, 2008 will be eligible. Those taking part will be entitled to severance payments based on years of service and retiree travel benefits. A spokeswoman for United Airlines said the agreement with the attendants is part on ongoing job and capacity cuts at the airline. On Wednesday, UAL said it will cut between 1,400 and 1,600 jobs and slash its domestic fleet, following similar cuts by rivals as the airline industry grapples with soaring fuel costs and a weakening economy.
