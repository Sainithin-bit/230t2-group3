 FAYETTEVILLE, Arkansas  (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc ( WMT.N ) is "exploring opportunities in Russia," the head of its international operations said on Friday. 

 Mike Duke made the comments at Wal-Mart's annual shareholders meeting, where the retailer touted the growth potential of its international business. Wal-Mart, the world's largest retailer, currently operates in 13 markets outside of the continental United States, including Japan and China. It also has established a joint venture in India. Duke's remarks are the latest in a series of statements indicating the company's interest in expanding into Russia. In May, Duke said Wal-Mart was taking "active steps" to research Russia and nearby countries in Eastern Europe. "We see this area offering Wal-Mart an opportunity to create value and service the emerging middle class," he said on a recorded call after the retailer reported first-quarter results. CEO Lee Scott has also voiced his interest in Russia. In October, at the company's analyst meeting, Scott said Wal-Mart hoped to be in that country "at some point in the future." Scott called Russia a "growing consumer nation." He said consumers there have shown a propensity to spend while in other developing countries they tend to save. On Thursday, Wal-Mart also said it saw potential for expansion in Asia beyond the countries where it currently operates. Vicente Trius, the head of Wal-Mart Asia, told reporters on Thursday that Southeast Asia as a whole "would be an area that has potential" for Wal-Mart.
