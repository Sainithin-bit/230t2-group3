 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Trade Commission has opened an antitrust investigation of semiconductor maker Intel Corp for anticompetitive conduct, The New York Times reported on its website on Friday. 

 The newspaper, quoting unnamed sources, said Intel, its smaller rival Advanced Micro Devices and several computer makers that buy semiconductors have begun to receive subpoenas from the FTC. An FTC official said the agency did not confirm investigations. (Reporting by  Julie Vorman ; editing by John Wallace)
