 BOSTON  (Reuters) - Federal Reserve Governor Randall Kroszner said on Friday housing markets will take some time to recover because of high inventories of unsold homes in parts of the country. 

 "It will take time, I think, given these historically high inventory numbers for the nation as a whole," he said in response to questions after a speech at Boston College. (Reporting by  Scott Malone , writing by Mark Felsenthal; Editing by Tom Hals)
