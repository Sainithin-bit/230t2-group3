 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Oil surged, the dollar weakened and government debt turned strongly higher on Friday after an unexpected jump in the U.S. unemployment rate rattled investors who believe the American economy was recovering. 

 Europe stocks and U.S. stock futures fell sharply after data showed the U.S. unemployment rate rose to its highest level in more than 3-1/2 years as American employers shed jobs for a fifth straight month in May. The unemployment rate rose to 5.5 percent last month from 5 percent, its highest level since October 2004. Some 49,000 jobs were cut from payrolls in May, up from a revised 28,000 that were lost in April, the Labor Department said. The FTSEurofirst 300  .FTEU3  index of top European shares declined 0.7 percent at 1,300.20 points after the announcement. The index had traded flat just before the data was released. The data surprised investors, giving them second thoughts about the health of the U.S. economy after recent data suggested a recession had been averted as the economy proved more resilient than many economists had expected. "We usually look at the big non-farm payroll figure but this time it seems to be the actual unemployment rate which has risen quite dramatically," said Angus Campbell, head of sales at Capital Spreads. "It's not looking great when the last few weeks we've had glimmers of hope for the market place." "A lot of people were saying a recession has actually just about been avoided but it's like the Titanic -- they thought they'd got away with it at first when they just shaved the iceberg but slowly and surely the ship did have irreparable damage and everything went under," Campbell said. S&P 500 futures fell 6.4 points, below fair value, a mathematical formula that evaluates pricing by taking into account interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the contract. Dow Jones industrial average futures fell 55 points, while Nasdaq 100 futures fell 10.5 points. Oil rose by more than $3 to above $131 a barrel, bringing gains in the last two days to $9 as the dollar weakened further on a jump in the jobless rate. Comments from Israel's transport minister that an attack on Iranian nuclear sites looked "unavoidable" given the apparent failure of sanctions to deny Tehran technology with bomb-making potential also helped drive crude prices higher. U.S. light crude for July delivery was up $3.23 at $131.02 a barrel. U.S. Treasury debt prices shed losses and rose. Benchmark 10-year Treasury notes traded 14/32 higher to yield 3.99 percent, while 2-year Treasury notes  traded 2/32 higher to yield 2.48 percent. The dollar dropped and the euro gained against the dollar to $1.5673 from $1.5590. Against the yen, the dollar fell to 105.82 yen from 106.30 yen. "This is more of a knee jerk reaction and things will settle down but the short term trend still favors a weaker U.S. dollar," said George Davis, chief technical strategist at RBC Capital Markets in Toronto. Earlier, repercussions from the European Central Bank saying it could raise interest rates swept across markets, hammering short-tern euro zone debt and lifting global stocks, which rallied as investors fled bonds and rolled over into stocks. ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet jolted markets on Thursday by saying higher benchmark interest rates were "possible" in July, kicking the euro higher and driving up bond yields as investors sold government debt. Stock markets had generally been buoyant ahead of the U.S. payroll data.
