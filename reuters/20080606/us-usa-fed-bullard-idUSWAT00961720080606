 MADISON, Wisconsin  (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve has cut interest rates enough to shield the U.S. economy from the housing crisis and must now tackle inflation for the remainder of the year, a top Fed official said on Friday. 

 "Given the current economic environment and the outlook for the next 18 months, my view is that policy is appropriately calibrated at this time," said St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank President James Bullard, making his first major public policy speech since taking the helm at the St Louis Fed in April. Bullard, who is not a voting member of the Fed's interest rate setting committee this year, said growth should pick up in the second half of 2008 and warned inflation expectations were fragile, presenting a challenge to the U.S. central bank. He also clearly hinted that the Fed should be thinking about raising rates before the end of this year. "It is rule number one in modern central banking that inflation and inflation expectations be kept under control. "After a 10-month period in which the dominant policy concern has rightly been the state of financial markets, policy can begin to address pressing inflationary concerns during the remainder of the year," he told a housing conference hosted by the University of Wisconsin-Madison. But he also did not signal that the Fed should be moving rates up imminently. "Acting preemptively means that patience is required when circumstances play out in a way that is consistent with the forecast," he said. This was a reference to the 3.25 percentage points of rate cuts that the Fed has delivered since September 2007 to cushion growth from housing and credit market woes. This has reduced its benchmark overnight rate to 2 percent and Bullard made plain that it would take a lot to persuade him it needed to go any lower. "Growth has indeed been slow, at least for the first half of 2008, but that cannot now be justification for further rate reductions. Surprises to forecasts of economic activity, if any, have been to the upside," he said. Bullard also said that financial market turmoil, while not over, was easing and the economy should pick up some steam in the second half of this year. Bullard, who took the reins at the St. Louis Fed from William Poole, spelled out that his definition of price stability would, like Poole, be zero, "correctly measured." He said this translated into 0.5 percent to 1.5 percent in measured inflation. He said that worries about inflation might be inhibiting the rate cuts from having their desired impact on growth, citing the failure of long-term mortgage rates to decline despite the aggressive policy action by the Fed. "Mortgage rates have not come down as far as probably we would like, and I would add that I think that part of that is probably because there is an inflation premium in longer-term interest rates," Bullard told the conference audience during a question-and-answer session. "There is a little bit of uncertainty right now about how big that inflation premium should be ... We're going to have to pivot, and talk about, and flip this (policy focus) on inflation later this year. So hopefully this will keep this under control."
