 LONDON  (Reuters) - The number of companies around the world at risk of getting a credit downgrade climbed to a record in May amid the global credit squeeze, ratings agency Standard & Poor's said on Friday. 

 The number of entities at risk of downgrade rose to 738 in May, 25 more than in April, S&P said. "A material slowdown in housing and consumer-related activity and protracted tightening of lending conditions have continued to dampen credit fundamentals," S&P said. The credit crisis sparked by the collapse of the U.S. sub-prime credit market, which led to multi-billion dollar losses among financial institutions, is spreading to the rest of the economy. The number of potential downgrades -- entities with either a negative outlook or which are on S&P's CreditWatch list -- is 118 higher than at the same time last year, the ratings agency said. "The upsurge in the count of entities at risk of downgrades began in mid-summer 2007 with the onset of a material erosion of the residential real estate sector and large writedowns by financial institutions," S&P said. The United States is home of two-thirds of the potential downgrades, while Europe represents 17 percent of the list, the report said. As companies struggle to make interest payments, U.S. junk bond defaults are expected to rise to 4.7 percent in the next 12 months from a 25-year low of 0.97 percent at the end of 2007, according to S&P. Another agency, Moody's Investors Service, said on Thursday that its rating downgrades and rating warnings are on pace to hit a record $1.6 trillion in the second quarter. Moody's has already downgraded about $551 billion of corporate debt and put another $517 billion on review for downgrade this quarter. If credit deterioration continues at that pace, downgrades will total $827 billion and reviews for downgrade $772 billion in the quarter. Sectors linked to the falling housing markets, such as mortgage lenders, forest products and building materials companies, are among the most susceptible to a downgrade, S&P said. Consumer-driven sectors, such as media and entertainment and consumer products, are also likely to worsen amid economic woes and record fuel prices.
