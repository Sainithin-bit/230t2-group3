 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Bank of America Corp ( BAC.N ) has sued financial adviser Kenneth Starr, who pleaded guilty to fraud last month, over a $500,000 loan. 

 Starr's investment firm, Starr Investment Advisers, had a $500,000 revolving credit agreement with Bank of America, according to documents filed in the State Supreme Court of New York on October 21. The bank said Starr's firm defaulted on the loan and now owes $500,000 plus $12,000 in interest and late fees. In September Starr, whose celebrity clients included director Martin Scorsese and singer Carly Simon, pleaded guilty to wire fraud, money laundering and adviser fraud. U.S. prosecutors accused him of defrauding clients of up to $50 million. (Reporting by Helen Kearney)
