 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - DuPont, which makes chemicals, building materials and agricultural products, posted a higher-than-expected quarterly profit as sales rose in all six business units and across the globe. 

 The company, a Dow Jones industrial average component whose results are seen as a key barometer on economic health, also increased its 2010 earnings forecast above Wall Street's expectations. During the third quarter, DuPont earned $367 million, or 40 cents per share, compared with $409 million, or 45 cents per share, a year earlier. Analysts on average expected earnings of 34 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Volume rose 14 percent, while local selling prices increased 5 percent. DuPont did spend aggressively on agricultural research during the quarter, and the loss in that segment widened to $181 million from $113 million. Wall Street had expected the increased spending as DuPont looks to outmaneuver competitor Monsanto. Pharmaceutical earnings dropped 58 percent as DuPont hypertension drugs Cozaar and Hyzaar -- developed with Merck -- go off patent in phases this year. Replacing that profit has been a key mission of DuPont Chief Executive Officer Ellen Kullman. "Our deep customer engagement and disciplined execution are gaining traction toward achieving our long-term growth targets," Kullman said in a statement. "This quarter's results were complemented by ongoing productivity improvements and rigorous cost management that contributed to profitable growth." Total revenue rose 14.8 percent to $7 billion. Analysts expected $6.72 billion. For 2010, DuPont now expects to earn $3.10 per share, excluding items, up from a previous estimate of $2.90 to $3.05. Analysts had forecast $3.04.
