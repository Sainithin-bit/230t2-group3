 LONDON  (Reuters) - British Airways' merger with Spain's Iberia will give the two loss-making airlines the scale they need to ride out recession and compete with larger European rivals Lufthansa and Air France. 

 The agreement, which will create a group with a combined market value of $7 billion if it goes through next year, ends the British carrier's two-year hunt for Iberia, and will allow it to emulate rivals who have successfully acquired smaller peers. BA shareholders will have 55 percent of the combined firm, to be headquartered in London with 419 aircraft flying to 205 destinations, while Iberia shareholders are to get 45 percent. BA's Chief Executive Willie Walsh, who will be CEO of the new group, wants to take on Air France-KLM -- formed from a Franco-Dutch merger in 2004 -- and Lufthansa, which has successfully combined with Swiss International Airlines and Austrian Airlines in recent years. "The deal will give them the potential to grow in a tough market that low-cost rivals can't match without losing money," Joaquin Garcia-Romanillos, analyst for Portuguese bank BPI said. NATURAL FIT The new firm, which will have annual revenues of 13.5 billion pounds, combines BA's strong position in Europe-to-North America traffic with Iberia's Latin American business, and will potentially be reinforced by a planned alliance with American Airlines. The merged entity could also cut less profitable short and medium-haul flights and compete better on the routes it retains. BA already has a code-sharing agreement with the Spanish carrier under the One World alliance, and the new company's enlarged global network will appeal to corporate customers. "One day, BA hopes that the barriers to cross-continental mergers will be removed, and the real prize here is the scale to participate in the ensuing consolidation process from a position of strength," said Astaire analyst Douglas McNeill. Analysts see BA and Iberia, who have targeted annual synergies of about 400 million euros by the end of the fifth year, as a "natural fit." One third of the synergies will be revenue-related and the remainder from cost savings in areas such as information technology, fleet, maintenance and back office, they said. RIVAL MERGERS Deutsche Lufthansa bought Swiss in 2005, a takeover that is still seen as one of Europe's most successful. Swiss's finances spun out of control when demand for air travel suddenly dropped following the September 11, 2001 World Trade Center attacks. By the time it tied up with Lufthansa, it had already taken great strides in restructuring its business and shortly after, the general economy picked up again. Investors are now waiting to see whether Lufthansa will be able to integrate its most recent acquisitions as successfully, having added in rapid succession Brussels Airlines, Austrian Airlines and British carrier bmi. The BA-Iberia deal mirrors the structure set up by Air France-KLM from the Franco-Dutch merger in 2004, which created a holding company plus two operational units to preserve national identities and bilateral international landing rights. Lufthansa reported annual revenues of 24.7 billion euros in 2008, with Air France just behind with sales of 24.1 billion euros for the year to the end of March 2009. BA posted revenues of 9.1 billion pounds in its last full year, while Iberia reported sales of 5.4 billion euros. Not all mergers work out, however. Japan Airlines (JAL) merged with Japan Airlines System (JAS) in 2002 -- a move that only increased the unprofitable routes it operated and which was compounded by a failure to cut costs. JAL is now struggling to stay afloat and may take a $1 billion loan from the state after it reported a loss of $1.5 billion in the first half. OPEN SKIES BA's merger ambitions have historically been frustrated by its dominant position at Heathrow and the European Commission could still force the carrier to give up take-off and landing slots there to allow a transatlantic alliance with American Airlines to go ahead. BA has applied to U.S. and European authorities for competition clearance, which would allow it to share costs and revenues on transatlantic routes with Iberia and American, following the 2008 Open Skies treaty that allowed EU operators to fly to the United States from any European country. "We expect BA to be given anti-trust immunity as Air France-KLM and Deutsche Lufthansa have been granted immunity and an open skies agreement has come into operation," said Charles-Stanley analyst Tony Shepard.
