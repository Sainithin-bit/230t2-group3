 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. consumer sentiment fell in early November to the weakest in three months amid grim expectations for job and income prospects, a survey showed on Friday. 

 KEY POINTS: * The Reuters/University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers said its preliminary index of sentiment for November fell to 66.0, the lowest since August, from 70.6 in October. This was well below economists' median expectation of a reading of 71.0, according to a Reuters poll. * The index of consumer expectations fell to 63.7 in early November from 68.6 in October. * "Confidence tumbled in early November due to the grim financial realities faced by consumers as well as weaker economic prospects for the year ahead -- importantly, the decline in confidence was already in place before the announced increase in the unemployment rate to 10.2 percent on November 6," the Reuters/University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers statement said. * Within the survey, the 12-month economic outlook index fell to 67, the lowest since April, from 81 in October. The 1-year inflation expectation eased to 2.8 percent from 2.9. COMMENTS: TOM PORCELLI, ECONOMIST, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS, NEW YORK: "It's not surprising when you consider that 10.2% unemployment rate was plastered all over every headline. "The only thing I would add was that it was slightly inconsistent with some of the weekly data which showed some improvement. "It's definitely a disappointment, particularly as we approach the holiday season. You don't want to see confidence falling into the holidays because that could affect spending." JULIA CORONADO, SENIOR US ECONOMIST, BNP PARIBAS, NEW YORK: "It certainly is a worrisome report; we've seen confidence not be able to get up off the floor, really. It rebounds and then falls back. I think what we're seeing is that despite the improvement in the stock market, which, in the past, has tended to raise consumer confidence, the current job market is leading consumers to hold on to a negative outlook...that could lead to less spending in the holiday seasons. "If we keep on the current trends in payrolls and we get job growth at the beginning of next year then we will see people start to gain more confidence. "The improvement in the stock market certainly doesn't seem to be having much influence. I haven't been able to really explain the stock market of late -- it sort of has been resilient to lots of bad data including unemployment numbers and depressed consumer sentiment. "It's a pretty broad-based deterioration. Both the current conditions and the assessment of future conditions fell and that is significant. They're back to July levels, so I think the optimism that was beginning to build is tarting to fade and that is worrisome." RICHARD SPARKS, SENIOR EQUITIES ANALYST/VICE PRESIDENT OF RESEARCH, SCHAEFFER'S INVESTMENT RESEARCH, CINCINNATI, OHIO: "It looks like it came in under expectations. We've seen evidence in many areas of the market that there is a lot of caution out there, a lot of skepticism on this rally. And after an initial dip the market has started to rally back. So we have a very resilient market and it appears it's kind of shaking off the effect of that bad number." JEFF KLEINTOP, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, LPL FINANCIAL, BOSTON: "Not too much of a surprise to see it (consumer confidence) weaken a little bit, remember that 10 percent unemployment headline probably did have some impact on confidence. Spending has actually been pretty good at the retailers but it looks confidence is more associated with the headlines, with the deficit and the unemployment rate weighing on sentiment here." CARY LEAHEY, ECONOMIST, DECISION ECONOMICS, NEW YORK: "This reverses the improvement of September and October. Consumer sentiment is stuck at a level that is quite unpromising. A reading of 80 usually characterizes a consumer that's feeling okay to good. "Consumers' gloomy mood is a manifestation of job scarcity. Even though firings are way down, hirings are not up at all. In addition, consumers have to tighten their belt because they are deleveraging. And third, consumers see Wall Street, which has gotten so much help from the government and the Federal Reserve, doing quite well while Main Street feels left behind. "Even if the overall economy has gone from deep recession to a mild recovery, the labor market has only gone from deep recession to recession. So the labor market is also being left behind. Consumers won't feel good until job growth returns." LARRY MILSTEIN, HEAD OF GOVERNMENT AND AGENCY TRADING, R.W. PRESSPRICH & CO., NEW YORK: "These are disappointing numbers, but they are not going to change the broader picture. These are not the kind of numbers you want to trade on, as long as the Fed is on hold and we could absorb the supply that supports the government's stimulus." SHAWN OSBORNE, SENIOR CURRENCY STRATEGIST, TD SECURITIES, TORONTO: "These numbers have been a bit hit-and-miss over the last couple of months. We've had a couple of down months now, but that's not too surprising given the headlines on employment and the gloom surrounding them. The general trend right now is a bit more risk averse, with the euro-dollar trapped in a broad $1.48-to-$1.51 range. Earlier this week, people were trying to play a breakout to the upside, but the midweek holiday came and after that many didn't want to get involved at these levels. I think the $1.4815-$1.4825 area is pretty firm support, so I'd expect to see buying on dips to this area." DOUG ROBERTS, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CHANNEL CAPITAL RESEARCH, SHREWSBURY, NEW JERSEY: "The is like a bi-polar market. One second we are worried about pulling out stimulus and the next moment we are worried if it's enough. "This decreases the need for raising interest rates fairly quickly. It kind of helps the Federal Reserve in their efforts. People are saying we can have jobless recovery. It's going to still be a problem unless people start getting jobs." RICK MECKLER, PRESIDENT, LIBERTYVIEW CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, NEW YORK: "Obviously the number was pretty low, and its driven so much by the unemployment issues faced in the country. It isn't necessarily reflective of corporate profits or even whether spending will be deeply curtailed. I think that if you ask someone about prospects and you're sitting with unemployment over 10 percent, you're bound to get a negative reaction. "Some of that is just concern, and doesn't reflect the fact that the employment picture appears to be bottoming. I don't think this is as bad as the headline would suggest. It's a trailing number, and as we get to the bottom of the trough, of course we'll get ugly numbers. But the stock market is looking six months ahead, and then is when we'll get better numbers." CARMINE GRIGOLI, CHIEF U.S. INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, EQUITY DIVISION, MIZUHO SECURITIES USA, NEW YORK: "I'd expect the (stock) market to recover from the initial sell-off, I don't see this as a game changer. Economic growth remains reasonably healthy under the circumstances and this number is not altering the perception that the economy will recover." GARY THAYER, CHIEF MACROSTRATEGIST, WELLS FARGO ADVISORS, ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI: "It was a disappointing number. We've seen some improvement in sentiment over the past year but it's still at a low level. Consumers are clearly still concerned about the economy and the job situation. It looks like a slow recovery in consumer spending until the job situation turns around." MARKET REACTION: STOCKS: U.S. stocks fell on the news. BONDS: U.S. Treasury debt prices gained. DOLLAR: U.S. dollar rose against the euro.
