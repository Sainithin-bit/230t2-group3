 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. consumer sentiment fell in early November to the weakest in three months amid grim expectations for job and income prospects, a survey showed on Friday. 

 KEY POINTS: * The Reuters/University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers said its preliminary index of sentiment for November fell to 66.0, the lowest since August, from 70.6 in October. This was well below economists' median expectation of a reading of 71.0, according to a Reuters poll. * The index of consumer expectations fell to 63.7 in early November from 68.6 in October. * "Confidence tumbled in early November due to the grim financial realities faced by consumers as well as weaker economic prospects for the year ahead -- importantly, the decline in confidence was already in place before the announced increase in the unemployment rate to 10.2 percent on November 6," the Reuters/University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers statement said. * Within the survey, the 12-month economic outlook index fell to 67, the lowest since April, from 81 in October. The 1-year inflation expectation eased to 2.8 percent from 2.9. COMMENTS: DOUG ROBERTS, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CHANNEL CAPITAL RESEARCH, SHREWSBURY, NEW JERSEY: "The is like a bi-polar market. One second we are worried about pulling out stimulus and the next moment we are worried if it's enough. "This decreases the need for raising interest rates fairly quickly. It kind of helps the Federal Reserve in their efforts. People are saying we can have jobless recovery. It's going to still be a problem unless people start getting jobs." RICK MECKLER, PRESIDENT, LIBERTYVIEW CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, NEW YORK: "Obviously the number was pretty low, and its driven so much by the unemployment issues faced in the country. It isn't necessarily reflective of corporate profits or even whether spending will be deeply curtailed. I think that if you ask someone about prospects and you're sitting with unemployment over 10 percent, you're bound to get a negative reaction. "Some of that is just concern, and doesn't reflect the fact that the employment picture appears to be bottoming. I don't think this is as bad as the headline would suggest. It's a trailing number, and as we get to the bottom of the trough, of course we'll get ugly numbers. But the stock market is looking six months ahead, and then is when we'll get better numbers." CARMINE GRIGOLI, CHIEF U.S. INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, EQUITY DIVISION, MIZUHO SECURITIES USA, NEW YORK: "I'd expect the (stock) market to recover from the initial sell-off, I don't see this as a game changer. Economic growth remains reasonably healthy under the circumstances and this number is not altering the perception that the economy will recover." GARY THAYER, CHIEF MACROSTRATEGIST, WELLS FARGO ADVISORS, ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI: "It was a disappointing number. We've seen some improvement in sentiment over the past year but it's still at a low level. Consumers are clearly still concerned about the economy and the job situation. It looks like a slow recovery in consumer spending until the job situation turns around." MARKET REACTION: STOCKS: U.S. stocks fell on the news. BONDS: U.S. Treasury debt prices gained. DOLLAR: U.S. dollar rose against the euro.
