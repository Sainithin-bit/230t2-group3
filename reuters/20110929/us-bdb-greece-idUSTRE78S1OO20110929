 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - German banking association BdB on Thursday warned against re-negotiating a 21 percent haircut on Greek sovereign debt agreed by lenders, saying it would lead to further distrust. 

 "The private sector has voluntarily agreed to a 21 percent haircut on Greek sovereign debt, which corresponds to about 30 billion euros for the stabilization of the Greek economy and fiscal situation," BdB chief Michael Kemmer said in a statement to Reuters. "This crisis can only be overcome by re-establishing the necessary trust in political actions. If the governments re-open negotiations on the agreed deal, the result will be exactly the opposite." Although private creditors were willing to make a contribution toward a Greek private sector bailout, Kemmer said that "a deal is a deal." (Writing By Edward Taylor)
