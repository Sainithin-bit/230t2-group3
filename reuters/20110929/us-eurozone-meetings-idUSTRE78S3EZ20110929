 (Reuters) - Europe overcame its latest obstacle on Thursday with Germany approving a stronger euro zone bailout fund, but a series of challenges remains as Greece tries to secure more aid to avoid imminent default. 

 Some national parliaments have yet to approve an agreement to increase the size and powers of the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF). Even if passed, many say the $440 billion fund does not have enough finances to carry out its increased mandate. An intractable debt crisis has forced euro zone finance ministers to meet regularly over this year. Here is a timeline of those meetings and gatherings in 2011. January 17, 2011 - Eurogroup meeting of euro zone finance ministers in Brussels to discuss the euro zone rescue fund. -- Euro zone finance ministers rejected the idea of enlarging the EFSF during discussions, the Dutch finance minister said the next day.
