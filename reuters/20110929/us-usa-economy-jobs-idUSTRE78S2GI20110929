 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - New claims for jobless benefits fell sharply last week to their lowest level since April although a Labor Department official said government statisticians had problems seasonally adjusting the data. 

 Applications for unemployment benefits fell by 37,000 to a seasonally adjusted 391,000 in the week ending September 24 from an upwardly revised 428,000 the prior week, the Labor Department said on Thursday. Analysts polled by Reuters had expected new claims to total 420,000 last week.
