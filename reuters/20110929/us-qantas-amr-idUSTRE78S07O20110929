 (Reuters) - Australia's competition regulator has given final approval for a transpacific alliance between Qantas Airways ( QAN.AX ) and AMR Corp's AMR.N American Airlines, it said on Thursday. 

 The airlines will coordinate operations on services between Australia/New Zealand and the United States and on their respective services which support these transpacific routes. "The ACCC does not consider that the JBA will have any anti-competitive effects, as Qantas and American Airlines do not currently provide any overlapping direct services on the transpacific routes," said Rod Sims, Chairman of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. The venture would benefit passengers, the ACCC said. (Reporting by  Miranda Maxwell )
