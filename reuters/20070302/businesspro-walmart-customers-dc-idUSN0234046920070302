 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - John Fleming, the new chief 
merchandising officer of Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ( WMT.N ), and 
Stephen Quinn, its new chief marketing officer, said in The New 
York Times that after a year of intense research, the discount 
giant is seeing its 200 million customers as belonging to three 
groups. 


  There are "brand aspirationals" (people with low incomes 
who are obsessed with names like KitchenAid), "price-sensitive 
affluents" (wealthier shoppers who love deals) and "value-price 
shoppers" (who like low prices and cannot afford much more), 
the report in the Times said.  The new categories are significant because for the first 
time, Wal-Mart thinks it finally understands not just how 
people shop at its stores, but why they shop the way they do, 
the newspaper reported.
