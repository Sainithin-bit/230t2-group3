 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The rapid rise in subprime mortgage delinquencies is having a knock-on effect on the rest of the housing industry and the U.S. economy as lenders rush to staunch their bleeding. 


 The rise, a byproduct of loose lending standards and the softening housing market, has hurt the ability of the riskiest borrowers to obtain loans. The problem for lenders, however, is now so out of control that they must begin to choke off credit to the growing segment of "Alt-A" borrowers with better, though not pristine, credit. The contagion has unnerved brokers, who are scrambling to complete mortgages before big lenders tighten terms. Two days before Countrywide Financial Corp. CFC.N disclosed that a surprising 19 percent of the non-prime mortgages it services reflect late payments, mortgage broker Bob Moulton opened an e-mail from the lender telling him some loans just above subprime status must be backed by a "FICO" credit score of 660, instead of 620, on a scale from 350 to 850. Mortgages will also be harder to obtain under new guidelines from another lender who that same day told Moulton, who runs Manhasset, New York-based Americana Mortgage Group, that it boosted required property appraisals from one to two. "It feels like this is just the tip of the iceberg and no one knows how it will shake out," Moulton said, adding that for now, "we're trying to anticipate guideline changes" as customers apply for loans. This tightening of credit, started by lenders themselves to protect eroding profits, may soon be forced upon banks by regulators including the Federal Reserve in a move to ensure bank safety and protect consumers. Regulators on Friday urged lenders to make sure subprime borrowers have the ability to meet the highest possible payments on a typical loan, instead of the lower initial rate. Subprime loans, the riskiest part of the U.S. mortgage market, serve borrowers with poor credit histories at higher interest rates. Default rates have risen in recent months amid falling prices and slower sales in the U.S. housing market. Subprime represented some 20 percent to 40 percent of all mortgages last year, according to FTN Financial. Subprime defaults are around 14 percent now, while late payment rates on Alt-A mortgages is about 3 percent, said Deutsche Bank analysts who warn the latter figure will rise. With the U.S. housing market teetering between stabilization and a deeper downturn, federal regulation on top of the industry's self-regulation may result in higher inventories and lower house prices, affecting the broader economy, said Chris Low, chief economist at FTN in New York. At worst, it may become so onerous to buy a home that there will be a dramatic contraction in the industry, he said. A borrower a month ago who could have qualified for a $450,000 interest-only loan for the home's full value without proving his income would today be limited to a $300,000 loan for 70 percent of the property value, Low said, citing a conversation with a nationwide lender. "Tighter lending standards will continue to limit demand and, as long as the law of supply and demand is still in effect, price appreciation will underperform other asset classes," he said. "None of this is good for the economy." Banks are tightening underwriting at their fastest pace since 1991, according to the Fed's Senior Loan Officer Survey. The net tightening index for residential mortgages surged to 16.4 in the first quarter of 2007 from 1.9 in the fourth quarter and -9.4 a year ago. The speed of lenders' reaction to the subprime turmoil is worrisome, economists said. Financially weaker borrowers are more likely to live paycheck to paycheck and probably also rely more heavily on extracting cash from their home equity, Goldman Sachs Chief Economist Jan Hatzius said in a research note. The Standard & Poor's/Case-Shiller Home Price Index of 20 metropolitan areas showed a 0.7 percent month-over-month drop in December to 203.07, S&P reported this week. The year-over-year gain was cut to 0.5 percent, it said. The now "localized" credit crunch may reduce U.S. gross domestic product growth by some 0.2 to 0.3 percentage point, FTN's Low said. That figure would climb if mortgage tightening begins to spread to the rest of the economy, he said. By restricting lending to some borrowers, Countrywide is showing the problem is more than a subprime one, analysts said. Alt-A loans, loosely defined as prime loans that don't meet the strict requirements of government-chartered mortgage buyers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, are also under greater scrutiny from bond rating companies. S&P last month for the first time said it may downgrade a bond backed by Alt-A loans originated in 2006. "When you have excesses in any type of lending there's potential for correction," said Peter Paul, who founded Alt-A lender Headlands Mortgage in 1986, which was purchased by GreenPoint Financial Corp. in 1999. There is spillover in credit problems to Alt-A today since lenders have widened definition of the loans to include riskier products, he said. "If you're right three to four years in a row, you think you are clever instead of fortunate," said Paul, whose San Rafael, California-based Paul Financial LLC originates Alt-A loans. "But when you don't have price appreciation, as a minimum, you will revert to the normal defaults." Higher quality Alt-A mortgages are being affected by the subprime turmoil that has some buyers of his loans putting them back to him after just a single missed payment, he said. But that hasn't changed his business much, he said. "It appears that everyone is aggressively enforcing the terms of their contracts (that allow them to return loans), and you could argue too aggressively, he said. "But we just bought them back and then sold to someone else."
