 ATLANTIC CITY, New Jersey  (Reuters) - Merck & Co. ( MRK.N ) failed to provide adequate warnings about health risks tied to its withdrawn arthritis drug Vioxx in one case, but gave adequate warning in another, a New Jersey jury found on Friday in a split decision in two suits tried simultaneously. 


 In both cases, the five-man, three-woman jury found that Merck committed consumer fraud by making misrepresentations concerning the drug's heart risks and that it intentionally suppressed or concealed material information from physicians prior to the plaintiffs' heart attacks. The Merck defeat in the case of Frederick Humeston was a retrial of a suit that the drugmaker had won only to have New Jersey Superior Court Judge Carol Higbee throw out the verdict after ruling that new evidence had come to light that Merck had excluded from the original trial. The Humeston case will now proceed to a second phase in which the jury will be asked to determine whether Vioxx was a primary cause of the Idaho postal worker's 2001 heart attack and decide compensatory damages. The second phase, set to start on Monday, will also determine any damages for violation of consumer fraud laws. In the other lawsuit, brought by the estate of Brian Hermans, who suffered a fatal heart attack at age 44 in September of 2002 after using Vioxx for 21 months, the jury voted 7-1 that Merck did adequately warn the patient's doctor of the Vioxx health risks. The discrepancy between the two verdicts was tied to the timing of a Vioxx label change that included additional health risk warnings. Merck had altered the Vioxx label five months before Hermans was stricken, but the change came after Humeston's heart attack. The Hermans estate should not be able to seek compensatory or punitive damages in the second phase but could be entitled to reimbursement for the out-of-pocket costs for the medicine and possibly legal costs under consumer fraud laws. However Mark Lanier, attorney for Hermans's estate, asked the judge to allow phase two to proceed as if the jury had found that Merck failed to warn in Hermans's case. In his motion following the verdict, Lanier argued that Hermans took the drug for more than a year before the label was changed in April 2002. "Lanier lost the case and now he wants a do-over," said Hope Freiwald, an attorney for Merck. The judge was expected to rule on Lanier's motion on Monday. In the second phase, Merck will argue that a host of existing health problems caused Humeston's heart attack, Freiwald said. "Mr. Humeston unfortunately had the kind of medical issues that cause people to have heart attacks every day, regardless of whether they were taking Vioxx," Freiwald said. Merck is facing more than 27,000 lawsuits from people who claim to have been harmed by the once $2.5 billion-a-year drug that was pulled from the market in September of 2004 after a study showed it doubled the risk of heart attack and stroke in patients taking it for at least 18 months. The New Jersey-based drugmaker has vowed to fight each lawsuit on a case-by-case basis rather than enter into any broad settlement agreement. Investors largely shrugged off the trial results. Merck shares closed up 20 cents at $44.19 on the New York Stock Exchange. "Our view is that we're not going to put too much import into any individual case," Deutsche Bank analyst Barbara Ryan said. "I think it's going to be a marathon that's going to play out over a very long period of time." (Additional reporting by  Lewis Krauskopf  in New York)
