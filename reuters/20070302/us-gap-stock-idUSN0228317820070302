 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Shares of Gap Inc.( GPS.N ) fell as much as 4.9 percent on Friday, a day after the apparel company reported a lower quarterly profit and said 2007 would be a transition year with earnings well short of Wall Street expectations. 


 Prudential Equity Group cut its price target on Gap to $17 a share from $23, while Credit Suisse cuts its to $25 from  $27. Analysts including those at Goldman Sachs, C.L. King, Lazard, Susquehanna, Cowan and Stifel Nicolaus lowered their fiscal 2007 estimates after Gap said the company expects earnings to a range of 80 cents to 90 cents, excluding a charge of 4 cents per share related to the closure of its Forth & Towne chain. Analysts, on average, had been expecting as of Thursday earnings of $1.00, according to Reuters Knowledge. Although some on Wall Street had predicted that Gap's sales woes and the recent departure of Chief Executive Paul Pressler might presage a sale of the San Francisco company, which operates the Gap, Old Navy and Banana Republic chains, analysts appeared resigned on Friday to the idea that there will be no quick fix. "We ... believe interim CEO Robert Fisher has taken that prospect (of a sale) off the table. The prospects for owning Gap should be centered on an earnings recovery," wrote C.L. King analyst Mark Montagna in a research note, citing the likelihood of a longer-than-expected recovery. Further pushing back any turnaround is the fact that Gap has yet to choose an executive search firm to help it recruit its next CEO, noted Lazard analyst Todd Slater. Slater and Needham & Co. analyst Christine Chen questioned the wisdom of Gap's continued roll-out of stores in its underperforming Old Navy and Gap chains. The company plans to open some 230 stores, weighted toward Old Navy, a number that . includes the conversion of Old Navy outlet stores to Old Navy stores. "We believe the route to faster (comparable sales) and profit recovery would be to freeze openings and increase closings until it is further along in its restructuring," wrote Slater. On Thursday, Gap interim CEO Robert Fisher acknowledged problems in management and operations that have hindered attempts to deliver exciting fashions to stores, as the company did in its heyday in the 1980s and 1990s. Besides confusion over who Gap's target customer is -- Gap acknowledged that a prior age range of 18 to 35 was too broad and created confusion among designers and consumers -- Fisher said that such cost-saving measures as buying in bulk had hindered creativity and made Gap less nimble. The company will focus on turning around its underperforming business, attracting new talent and simplifying operations, Fisher said. Shares of Gap were down 3.3 percent at $18.41 in afternoon trade on the New York Stock Exchange, after earlier falling as low as $18.09.
