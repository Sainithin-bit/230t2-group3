 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Citigroup Inc.'s ( C.N ) new chief financial officer Gary Crittenden may be paid close to $10 million this year, including as much as $9.5 million in incentive awards, the company said on Thursday. 


 In a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Citigroup said Crittenden will receive a $500,000 annual salary, and is eligible for up to $9.5 million of pre-tax incentive awards for each of 2007 and 2008. The 53-year-old agreed last month to join Citigroup from American Express Co. ( AXP.N ), where he was also CFO. According to American Express' most recent proxy statement, Crittenden's compensation totaled $8.11 million in 2005. Sallie Krawcheck, Citigroup's current CFO, was awarded $10.1 million of compensation for 2005. She will become Citigroup's global wealth management chief on March 12, the day Crittenden is expected to begin work. Citigroup and American Express are based in New York.
