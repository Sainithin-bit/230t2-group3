 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - NYSE Group NYX.N, which operates the New York Stock Exchange, has requested relief for one month from compliance with certain securities regulations taking effect on Monday. 


 This would be the second delay requested by the top U.S. stock exchange in complying with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission regulations called Reg NMS, or Regulation National Market System, requiring it to route orders to automated, or "fast," markets according to the best available price. An SEC spokesman said he was not aware that the request had been granted as of late Friday afternoon. The Big Board said it is already in compliance with most of Reg NMS but needs more time to be able to route orders to a rival stock exchange operated by the International Securities Exchange ISE.N and to alternative trading platforms regulated by the NASD, one of the securities industry's self-regulatory organizations. "We are Reg NMS ready, and have been effectively operating in an NMS environment for weeks," said NYSE spokesman Richard Adamonis. "The exemption requested of the SEC enables us to provide connectivity to the NASD Alternative Display Facility participants and the ISE Stock Exchange through the Archipelago Securities routing system on or before April 5." The issue at NYSE may relate to the Intermarket Trading System, established by the SEC in 1978 to link exchanges. The ISE Stock Exchange is not a member of the system. ISE, the largest U.S. electronic options exchange, declined to comment. But Keefe, Bruyette & Woods analyst Richard Herr said the delay in routing could be harmful to the ISE Stock Exchange, which was launched late last year. "We believe NYSE likely started putting the functionality to route to the more significant market centers first," said Herr. "ISE is one of the newer entrants and it sounds like NYSE fell a little short in terms of timing." It has not been an easy week for the Big Board, which faced questions about trading glitches amid Tuesday's market rout. NYSE experienced major delays while handling record traffic on its electronic routing system. "There is a lot on their plate but by April the NYSE should be in good shape," said KBW's Herr. The exchange had also requested in January that a February 5 deadline for the regulations be delayed until March. The request would not extend the overall compliance deadline for Reg NMS, which the SEC confirmed in a statement on Friday is still set for Monday. NYSE shares closed up 31 cents, or 0.4 percent, at $82.01 and shares of ISE were down $1.23, or 2.7 percent, at $44.53.
