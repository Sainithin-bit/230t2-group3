 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Generic drug maker Mylan Laboratories Inc. MYL.N said on Friday it is raising at least about $993.6 million in a public offering of notes and common shares, with proceeds intended for global operations and potential acquisitions. 


 Mylan, shares of which were down about 2 percent in late morning trade, said $550 million of senior convertible notes due 2012 priced at par and will accrue interest of 1.25 percent per annum. It also said an offering of 22.75 million shares priced at $19.50 a share, a 3.8 percent discount to its closing price of $20.26 Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange. Earlier this week, people familiar with the situation said Mylan is among those interested in bidding for Merck KGaA's ( MRCG.DE ) generic drugs business. The global generic, or nonpatented, drugs industry has seen a flurry of acquisition activity recently, as companies seek scale and geographic spread. "Clearly this money is being raised to continue to fund a global growth strategy, but whether or not it is specifically Merck I find a bit questionable," said Elliot Wilbur, an analyst at CIBC Markets. "There is a great tendency to connect the dots." The offerings would only provide a fraction of the estimated price for Merck's generic business of more than $5 billion. Some investors are also jittery as Mylan has no track record in swallowing such a large acquisition outside its home turf of the U.S., Wilbur said. Last year, Mylan acquired a controlling interest in India's Matrix Laboratories Ltd. MAXL.BO. A Mylan spokesperson did not return a call seeking comment, In a statement, the company said that it intends to use the net proceeds of the offerings, expected to close on March 7, for general corporate purposes, including expanding global operations, acquisitions, licensing and other strategic options. The notes carry an initial conversion rate of 44.5931 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes, which represents an initial conversion price of about $22.43 per share. Mylan granted the underwriters an option to purchase up to an additional $50 million in notes and 3.4 million shares to cover overallotments. The offerings would raise a total of about $1.1 billion if the overallotment options were exercised in full. The joint book-running managers for the convertible note and common stock offerings are Merrill Lynch & Co. and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. Shares of Mylan were down 38 cents to $19.88 on the New York Stock Exchange in active trading.
