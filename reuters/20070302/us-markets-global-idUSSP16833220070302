 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. stocks dropped at their open on Friday, following European and Asian markets lower to cap one of the most punishing weeks for global equities in years, marked by a sudden reversal in investor risk appetites. 


 The equities moves were guided largely by the surging Japanese yen, which touched 11-week highs against the dollar and was on pace for its biggest weekly advance against the greenback in 14 months. Investors viewed the gains in yen as indicative of an unwinding global carry trade. That investment strategy, a favorite among hedge funds, featured borrowing funds in low-yielding yen and investing them in assets and regions offering higher returns, albeit often at higher risk. With the yen gaining, the cost of covering those leveraged bets was rising quickly, and many investors in the trade were forced this week to sell everything from U.S. and international stocks to emerging market bonds to close positions in borrowed yen. Just after 10 a.m. (1500 GMT), the yen was up 0.35 percent at 117.19, but off its early-session highs. Against the euro, the dollar was nearly unchanged at $1.3168. "Treasury and stock markets are going to be highly sensitive to the unwind of trades against the yen today," said T.J. Marta, fixed income strategist with Royal Bank of Canada Capital Markets in New York. U.S. stocks took an additional leg lower after the first 30 minutes of trading when the Reuters/University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers showed consumer sentiment in February dropped to a five-month low. the Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  was down 16.02 points, or 0.13 percent, at 12,218.32; the Standard & Poor's 500 index  .SPX  was down 3.42 points, or 0.24 percent, at 1,399.75; and the Nasdaq composite index  .IXIC  was down 6.88 points, or 0.29 percent, at 2,397.33. More than two stocks were down for every one higher on the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq. While stocks have suffered as the trade unwinds, prompting a large spike in market volatility, government bonds have been the beneficiary of a flight-to-safety bid. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note was up 1/32, with the yield at 4.55 percent, and 2-year notes were up 1/32 with the yield at 4.59 percent. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index  .FTEU3  was down 0.36 percent. The index has fallen about 5 percent over the week. Asian stock markets ended mixed but mainly lower, with Tokyo's Nikkei average  .N225  erasing its gains for the year to close down 1.35 percent at 17,217.9. MSCI's index of Asian stocks outside Japan .MSCIAPJ was down 0.5 percent. But China's composite share index  .SSEC , which helped spark the rout on Tuesday with a near-9 percent dive, moved up 1.2 percent and Hong Kong's Hang Seng  .HSI  rose 0.5 percent.
