 SEOUL  (Reuters) - Shares in South Korean steel maker POSCO ( 005490.KS ) surged as much as 4.1 percent on Friday after billionaire investor Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. said it held a small stake in the firm as of the end of 2006. 


 The disclosure is the latest positive news for POSCO ( PKX.N ), the world's no.3 steel maker, which has seen shares scale record highs amid optimism about its improving fundamentals and amid a consolidation in the global steel sector. Berkshire ( BRKa.N ) ( BRKb.N ) stands to make a killing on its 4 percent stake in POSCO, if it has not already sold it. The stake was worth 1.27 trillion won ($1.35 billion) as of Friday's closing share price, more than double the $572 million Berkshire paid for the stake. "Buffett's other investments include Coca-Cola, so to have POSCO included in the same group can only help it gain more global status," said Kim Gyung-jung, an analyst at Samsung Securities. "It's a good decision. POSCO is going to benefit from a recovery in global steel prices. Its production costs are going to get lower. POSCO is also expected to steadily increase dividends," he added." The Oracle of Omaha, as Buffett is known, said Berkshire owned a 4 percent stake, or 3.5 million shares, in POSCO, as of December 31, 2006, according to his widely-read annual letter to shareholders out on Thursday. The world's richest person after Bill Gates did not comment on POSCO directly, just listing the steel maker among the global companies in which Berkshire has invested. An official at POSCO said it did not know when Berkshire bought shares in the company. POSCO shares surged on the news, ending up 3.12 percent at 364,000 won, compared with a 0.2 percent fall in the benchmark KOSPI  .KS11 . The shares hit a record 384,000 won on February 23. SECTOR CONSOLIDATION Shares in the steel maker have surged 80.2 percent since the beginning of 2006 to Friday's close, far outperforming the 2.5 percent gain in the KOSPI during that period. Analysts have attributed the rally to expectations for further consolidation in the global steel sector, after Mittal Steel ( ISPA.AS ) in 2006 took over rival Arcelor CELR.PA in a deal worth around $33 billion. POSCO's CEO said last week it was seeking to acquire promising firms to boost its own value and protect itself against hostile takeover bids, while pledging to increase shareholder value, which investors believe will come in the form of dividends. Fundamentals have also played a role in POSCO's surge, with the steel maker posting its first profit growth in a year in 2006, and with analysts forecasting earnings to improve this year amid rising steel prices and improved efficiency. Japan's top two steel makers Nippon Corp. ( 5401.T ) and JFE Holdings Inc. ( 5411.T ) on Thursday raised their full-year profit forecasts on continued strong demand for high-end steel, which also provides the bulk of profits at POSCO. The South Korean steel maker also signed last year a contract to build a $12 billion integrated steel complex in Orissa, located on India's east cost, marking the largest single foreign investment in the emerging economic giant. Berkshire's other investments as of the end of 2006 included an 8.6 percent stake in soft drinks maker Coca-Cola Co. ( KO.N ). The only other company in the region listed by Buffett's fund was Petrochina ( 0857.HK ), Asia's top oil producer, with a 1.3 percent stake.
