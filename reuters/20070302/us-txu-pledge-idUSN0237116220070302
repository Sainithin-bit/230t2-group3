 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - An investor group seeking to acquire TXU Corp. TXU.N pledged that if its $32 billion buyout bid is successful it will hold on to the utility for at least five years and will not load any acquisition-related debt onto the utility, the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday. 


 The statement by Texas Energy Future Holdings LP, a holding company formed by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co., Texas Pacific Group and other investors, came in response to Texas lawmakers' criticism of the transaction expressed in hearings earlier this week, paper said. Under the proposed buyout, the surviving entity could emerge with as much as $33 billion of debt, the paper said. Such debt could lead to higher costs for consumers, the paper said.
