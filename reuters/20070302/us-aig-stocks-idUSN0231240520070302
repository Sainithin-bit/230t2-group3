 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - American International Group Inc. ( AIG.N ) shares rose in midday trading on Friday after the world's largest insurer reported late Thursday that earnings in the latest fourth quarter were nearly eight times higher than the year earlier net. 


 AIG is trading at $69.88, up 3.7 percent or $2.47 on the New York Stock Exchange. It is near its 12-month high of  $72.97. "Investors were impressed by both the year over year and quarter over quarter figures," said Donald Light, an analyst with Celent LLC. "They are giving AIG Chief Executive Martin Sullivan a huge vote of confidence," For the year, AIG reported net income of $14.05 billion, more than $3.5 billion higher than last year's. For the quarter, earnings were $3.44 billion or $1.31 a share compared to $444 million or 17 cents a share. In a conference call with investors on Friday, Sullivan also said that, except for a few items, AIG had "overcome its regulatory challenges." In the year ago fourth quarter, AIG paid $1.64 billion, the largest regulatory settlement by a single company in history, to settle charges of fraud, bid-rigging and improper accounting.
