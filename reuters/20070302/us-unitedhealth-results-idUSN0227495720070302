 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - UnitedHealth Group Inc. ( UNH.N ) said on Friday it expects to become current with its U.S. financial filings by March 15, a major step for the health insurer as it seeks to recover from a stock options scandal. 


 Shares of UnitedHealth rose more than 4 percent after it said it expects to file its Form 10-K annual report with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on or before March 15. UnitedHealth, the largest U.S. health insurer by market value, said it would also file an amended report for its first quarter and turn in delayed reports for the second and third quarters. To do so, the company requested an automatic two-week extension beyond a March 1 deadline for filing its annual report with the SEC. Investors have been waiting for UnitedHealth to give a timetable for its filings, as the delay has postponed its share buyback program and raised questions over its ability to focus on operating performance. "It's certainly one of the positive catalysts that I have been looking for," CIBC analyst Carl McDonald said. "It signifies that the options issue largely is behind them." Minneapolis-based UnitedHealth is the subject of a formal SEC probe into its stock options grants and has been under pressure since its grant practices came under scrutiny a year ago. The company's longtime chief William McGuire left last year in the wake of a damaging report by its independent counsel that found evidence of backdated stock options. It has said its financial statements from 1994-2005 and the first three quarters of 2006 should no longer be relied upon. "Resuming timely and complete periodic reports is critical to the interest of our investors, customers and employees, and we are very pleased that we have been able to move quickly and judiciously in cooperation with the SEC," CEO Stephen Hemsley said in a statement. The filing delay has also put UnitedHealth's share buyback on hold and the company expects to resume share purchases once it becomes current. CIBC's McDonald said UnitedHealth has committed to a $4 billion stock buyback this year, or about 5.5 percent of its market value, "so it's not an insignificant number." Analysts are also concerned the company's options review has been a distraction from meeting its operating goals and want clarity over any tax liability from the options matter. UnitedHealth last month cut its 2007 revenue forecast after it reduced its enrollment projection for full-service Medicare plans for seniors for the second time. "This does remove another cloud from the story, and enables management to focus on operating challenges," Bank of America analyst Joseph France said in a research note. UnitedHealth shares rose $2.17, or 4.1 percent, to $54.91 on the New York Stock Exchange, amid slight declines for shares of rivals Aetna ( AET.N ) and WellPoint ( WLP.N ). UnitedHealth shares are still down about 6 percent over the past 12 months, but far above their 52-week low of $41.44 last May.
