 SANTIAGO  (Reuters) - St Louis Federal Reserve President William Poole said on Friday that oil supply shocks need not cause recessions and were no excuse for a central bank to allow inflation to escape its control. 


 "Without question, energy supply shocks are disruptive, but they need not create recessions," Poole, a voting member of the U.S. Federal Reserve's interest rate-setting committee this year, told a business breakfast at the American Chamber of Commerce here. "Indeed, there is a more general lesson from experience with oil price shocks. Monetary policy should not allow an economy to operate at the edge of a cliff," said Poole, who blamed the 1970s inflation on "over-expansionary monetary policy, not oil shocks." A copy of his speech was released to the media in Washington prior to delivery.
