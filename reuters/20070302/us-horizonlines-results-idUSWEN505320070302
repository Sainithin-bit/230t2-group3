 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Container shipping company Horizon Lines Inc. HRZ.N reported a quarterly profit on Friday as revenue gains from rate increases and other factors more than offset some volume softness. 


 Horizon reported net income of $10.6 million, or 31 cents per diluted share, for its fourth quarter ended December 24, compared with a net loss of $10.9 million, or 38 cents per share, in the year-earlier quarter when it had costs related to a recent initial public offering. Horizon earned 34 cents a share excluding expenses related to an initial public offering, a loss on debt retirement and other adjustments. Analysts on average expected 32 cents per share on that basis, according to Reuters Estimates. Operating revenue rose 3 percent to $287.5 million, driven by cargo mix upgrades, rate increases and a higher recovery of fuel costs that more than offset some volume softness, Horizon said. Analysts expected $291.8 million. Operating income rose to $22.9 million in the quarter, from $19.9 million, a year earlier, when excluding the secondary offering, IPO and transaction-related expenses, it said. Horizon provides container shipping between the continental United States, Alaska, Hawaii, Guam and Puerto Rico under the Jones Act, which stipulates that shipping between U.S. ports be handled by U.S. registered companies on U.S. registered ships manned predominantly by U.S. citizens. Charlotte, North Carolina-based Horizon ships consumer and industrial items ranging from food and household goods to auto parts and building materials. Horizon shares were off 31 cents, or 1.1 percent, at $28.68 on the New York Stock Exchange.
