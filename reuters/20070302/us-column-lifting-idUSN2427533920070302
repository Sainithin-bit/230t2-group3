 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Investors will be getting a lot more information about CEO pay and perks this year. 


 Companies will also have to reveal something else: just how much chief executives stand to take home if they're forced out. As part of revised regulatory disclosures on executive pay, companies now must calculate potential severance costs as well as the "parachute pay" top executives are eligible to collect if their company is acquired and they lose their job. CEOs typically earn a handsome salary and bonus but, as shareholders of Home Depot Inc. ( HD.N ) and other companies have discovered, the really big money can come when they depart. Top executives often walk away with large lump-sum cash payments, a package of retirement benefits and tax "gross-ups" to cover their IRS obligations. Some can even stay eligible for perks like private use of the corporate jet. The total value of exit deals now must be revealed in a new section of a company's annual proxy filing, material sent to shareholders ahead of its annual meeting, according to revised U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rules. This data has always been available, but the information often could only be pieced together by searching through a jumble of tables and footnotes in various regulatory filings. The severance arrangements outlined will be "where some of the really big, potentially scary numbers could appear," said Michael Melbinger, a corporate lawyer who advises boards on compensation and governance issues. In the past, "you could never possibly figure out that figure before. Now you have to report it," he said, referring to corporate disclosures of exit-pay arrangements. For months, companies have been bracing for the change. The new rules come into force as executive pay -- always a contentious topic -- has become a hot political issue. Congressional hearings on CEO pay are planned this month, while President George W. Bush has told Wall Street that companies should better tie CEO compensation to performance. THE DEPARTED Experts say that under the new disclosure rules, companies such as Home Depot and Pfizer Inc. ( PFE.N ) would have had to report much more explicitly the value of exit packages for their chief executives before they departed. Both companies came under fire from shareholders following disclosures of packages worth about $200 million apiece. In another departure that riled investors, the CEO of North Fork Bancorp walked away with at least $135 million upon the bank's sale to Capital One Financial Corp. ( COF.N ) last year. Investors will now be able to keep closer tabs on executive payouts, said Brian Cumberland, head of the compensation and benefits practice at Alvarez & Marsal Tax Advisory Services, which offers advice to companies. "From the SEC's standpoint, it's one of the reasons they put this rule in place," he said. According to a study of 200 large companies by Cumberland's firm, 63 percent of CEOs are entitled to collect cash severance payments of at least three times their annual compensation through change-in-control agreements. These policies would kick in if the executive was forced out because of a takeover or change in control. About two-thirds of CEOs are also eligible for tax gross-up payments, meaning the company helps pay extra taxes levied on the exit pay. Corporate America argues that what may seem like overly generous packages actually help protect shareholders, by allowing CEOs to focus on what's best for the company -- not on the fate of his or her job -- in any takeover battle. But critics say companies give too much away. "There can be reasonable change-in-control provisions that will incentives a CEO to stay with a company, but there's got to be some rationality to it," said Richard Ferlauto, director of pension and benefit policy at the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees. Ferlauto expects many companies to take a close look -- and revise in some cases -- CEO contracts to avoid attracting investor scrutiny this spring when proxy filings are released. Engineering and construction company Shaw Group Inc. SGR.N said in late January it was altering Chairman and CEO J.M. Bernhard Jr.'s employment contract at his request. The new agreement reduced Bernhard's severance agreement to three years' worth of salary and bonuses from 10 years. Still, Bernhard won't do so badly. Shaw, which did not immediately return a call seeking comment, retained some terms of the prior agreement. Among them: a $15 million cash payment to Bernhard if there is a change-in-control event and personal use of company aircraft for 10 years.
