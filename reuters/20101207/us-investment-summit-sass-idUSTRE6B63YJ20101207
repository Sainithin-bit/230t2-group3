 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. equities offer substantial upside potential, even if the country's economic growth remains sluggish, veteran money manager Martin Sass said on Tuesday, as he forecast a 20 percent rise in the S&P 500 in 2011. 

 Sass sees equities growth being fueled by corporations' piles of cash -- cash piles that they will start spending on plants, equipment, or mergers and acquisitions. "I remain very positive about the market," Sass, the founder of M.D. Sass, said at the Reuters 2011 Investment Outlook Summit. He called U.S. equities "the cheapest major asset class out there" and said his firm has a target for the Standard & Poor's 500 index of 1,470 through year-end 2011. A year ago, Sass forecast the S&P 500 closing 2010 at 1,250. On Tuesday the index was up 0.45 percent at 1,228.59. The S&P 500 forward price-to-earnings ratio is now around 13.3 percent. Sass, whose firm manages approximately $7.5 billion across equity and fixed income asset classes, said "investor skepticism has kept people rather conservative in their expectations for the economy and we think overly so. "So we think there will be positive surprises in terms of earnings growth, which is what happened this year and we think will happen again next year for the overall market." MD Sass's total equity portfolio is up 14.2 percent year-to-date versus 10.2 percent on the S&P 500. "People are obviously looking at slow growth in GDP ... and they say slow growth, subpar recovery, ugly for equities," said Sass. "What I look at as the more important driver for equities is corporate profits and cash flow and balance sheet strength. So when you look at the corporate profit recovery, we are in a V-shaped recovery. We are not in a sluggish recovery." Sass said equities will also benefit because corporation are using their cash to buy back shares. In addressing other asset classes, Sass forecast the price of oil to rise to $100 a barrel by the end of next year and $110 in 2012. Crude oil was off 72 cents at $88.66. And asked what asset class might be the biggest surprise in 2011, he said: "The sleeper asset class that is awakening this year and I think will continue to awaken is non-agency distressed and high-yield asset-backed securities." SECTOR STRENGTH Within equities, Sass remains bullish on many of the areas he identified last year and highlighted five companies whose stock price he said could appreciate by 25 percent in the next 12 months. They are: oil services and exploration companies Halliburton Co and Devon Energy Corp; gambling game machine maker WMS Industries Inc; drug distribution company McKesson Corp; and Hewlett-Packard Co. Also in the oil services sector, Sass highlighted Cameron International Corp and Baker Hughes Inc. "China's demand is soaring. The emerging countries alone over the next five years will account for about 90 percent of the increase in demand for energy. Regulation is less onerous overseas," Sass said. He called Devon Energy "extremely undervalued" at its current price. It was trading at $74.42 on Tuesday. Generic drug makers are attractive because of the coming "patent cliff" many companies face. Lipitor, Pfizer's cholesterol fighter, which is the world's biggest-selling drug, will come off its U.S. patent in November of next year. Watson Pharmaceuticals Inc. has a generic version of Lipitor, making it attractive. Another generic maker to benefit from patent expiration is Mylan Inc. Sass, however, is steering clear of the banking sector, citing less compelling basic economics for the sector and potential liabilities that may exceed expectations. He said his sold Goldman Sachs Group Inc and Bank of America Corp. "We probably sold Bank of America shortly after we met (last year) because I became very concerned about balance sheet problems and issues like mortgage put-back exposure of the banks. So we sold all our banking stocks," he said. "We continue to avoid the banking sector. There is one exception, State Street, which is a trust bank, not your typical money sector bank However, the firm has increased its holdings of insurer MetLife Inc. AVOID TREASURIES TOO Sass also warned on government bonds, with investors who turned to them as a safe haven on the way to finding their portfolios are shrinking as a result of higher bond yields. The 10-year yield rose to 3.14 percent in midday trade on Tuesday. In October it hit a low yield of 2.38 percent. Sass said he expects benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yields to rise to 4 percent by the end of next year: "The bull market in bonds is over, in U.S. Treasuries especially."
