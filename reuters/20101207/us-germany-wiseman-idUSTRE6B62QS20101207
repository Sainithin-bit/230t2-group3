 BERLIN  (Reuters) - Euro zone countries need to increase fiscal discipline and the chances that budget offenders will face sanctions, said Wolfgang Franz, the chairman of the German panel of economic advisers. 

 "For the foreseeable future, it seems unrealistic to expect a joint fiscal policy in the euro zone, even though that would be very important for the success of the currency union," Franz told Reuters in an interview. "Instead one should make an effort to secure the solidity of individual national fiscal policies ... for instance by significantly increasing the likelihood that sanctions will be imposed in cases of fiscal misconduct," he added. The panel of five wise men, which includes one woman and which Franz chairs, advises the German government on economic policy. Franz also said he thought euro bonds were inappropriate.
