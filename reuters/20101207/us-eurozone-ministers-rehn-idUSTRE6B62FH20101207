 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - The European Union will begin a new round of tougher stress tests for banks in February as part of its response to dealing with the debt crisis, EU Economics and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn said on Tuesday. 

 "One of the elements is the preparation of a new round of even more rigorous and even more comprehensive bank stress tests which will start from February next year and will be based on new financial architecture," Rehn told a news conference after talks with EU finance ministers and other officials on Tuesday. He also said it was important to have the fullest possible transparency on the stress tests for banks.
