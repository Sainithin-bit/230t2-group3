 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japan's Hitachi Ltd said on Monday it will partner with U.S.-based Johnson Controls Inc in auto-use lithium-ion and other battery technologies as demand for hybrid cars grows. 

 The Japanese electronics conglomerate said the two will discuss how they will cooperate in development, production and sales. The Nikkei business daily said that if the collaboration leads to major contracts with carmakers, they will build factories under a joint venture. A Hitachi spokeswoman said no details have been decided. Johnson Controls is a major automobile battery maker, controlling about 30 percent market share in lead-acid storage batteries.
