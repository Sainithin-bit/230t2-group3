 BEIJING  (Reuters) - China aims to achieve a breakthrough in economic restructuring, while also moving ahead with "vigorous but steady" political reform, the government said in laying out its plan for the next five years. 

 The Communist Party's central committee also vowed to boost domestic demand as part of efforts to maintain fast, stable growth in its development strategy for the 2011-2015 period, the official Xinhua news agency reported. (Reporting by Aileen Wang and  Simon Rabinovitch ; Editing by  Ken Wills )
