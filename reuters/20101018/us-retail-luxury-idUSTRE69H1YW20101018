 MILAN  (Reuters) - The global market for luxury goods is expected to return to pre-crisis levels in 2011 on the back of a 10 percent growth this year, helped by booming Asia and Chinese tourists shopping in Europe, a report said on Monday. 

 U.S. consultancy Bain & Co said in a study on the outlook for the industry published on Monday it expects sales of luxury goods to rise between 3 and 5 percent next year, with leather bags, watches and jewels driving the recovery. Global sales should rise to 173-176 billion euros ($246 billion) in 2011, up from 170 billion euros in 2007. "In the first half of this year we talked about a light at the end of the tunnel," Santo Versace, chairman of Italian luxury goods association Altagamma which contributed to the study, said in a statement. "On the basis of the preliminary 2010 figures, we can confirm that positive trend," Santo Versace, who is also chairman of Italian fashion house Versace. Global sales of luxury goods are expected to grow 10 percent to 168 billion euros this year, after falling 8 percent in 2009, the worst year for the industry in more than two decades, the study said. However, players with global reach, strong brand heritage and efficient retail network have weathered the storm. LVMH ( LVMH.PA ), the world's biggest luxury group beat third-quarter forecasts this month, confirming a strong rebound in the sector. China remains the fastest-growing luxury market with sales expected to rise 30 percent this year, while crisis-hit Japan will start to recover only next year, the study showed. Sales in Europe, whose luxury brands account for around 75 percent of the global market, are seen up 6 percent this year, fueled by shoppers from emerging markets such as China. The United States, where sales fell 15 percent in 2009 hit by discounts at department stores, are seen growing sales by 7 percent higher this year, or 12 percent at constant foreign exchange rates. "Global consumption in 2011 should be significantly close to the record levels of 2007," Altagamma's secretary general Armando Branchini said in a statement. Leather bags, shoes, jewelry and watches are expected to rise more than 8 percent next year, trailed by clothing, perfumes, cosmetics and tablewear. The luxury yacht industry will continue to fall at double-digit rates this year to an estimated 6.4 billion euros, Bain said, with smaller boats reacting better to the unfavorable sales environment. Although competition remains tough, luxury goods groups' margins are expected to improve next year. (Reporting by Antonella Ciancio; Editing by Mike Nesbit) ($1=.7153 euros)
