 BANGALORE  (Reuters) - H&R Block Inc ( HRB.N ) sued HSBC Bank USA, a unit of HSBC ( HSBA.L ), alleging the bank breached a contract, which could stop the No. 1 U.S. tax preparer from offering refund anticipation loans, sending its shares down 12 percent to a year-low. 

 In a regulatory filing, H&R Block said it and its units filed a complaint against HSBC Bank in a federal court in Missouri for injunctive relief and is seeking to require the bank to perform its contractual obligations. In the court filing, H&R Block alleged that HSBC Bank had failed to conduct preparatory actions that would have allowed H&R Block to offer instant RALs and refund anticipation checks to its clients. Kansas City, Missouri-based H&R Block said in the court filing that it would not be able to offer these products for the 2011 tax season if HSBC Bank failed to perform its contractual obligations within the next two months. HSBC Bank did not return calls requesting comment. Refund anticipation loans, also known as tax-refund loans, typically last 7-14 days until taxpayers receive their refunds from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. "H&R depends on these loans early in the (tax) season because a lot of the customers need the money early. If they can't provide these products early, they might lose these customers," Morningstar analyst Vishnu Lekraj told Reuters. H&R Block's main rival, Jackson Hewitt Service Inc JTX.N, has seen its stock price plummet since last December after it failed to secure funding for its RALs. The possible halt of its RAL program could also hurt H&R Block's ability to attract new clients to its stores, at a time when its digital offering is facing increased competition from Intuit Inc's ( INTU.O ) TurboTax software. Shares of H&R Block fell 12 percent to $10.77, a 52-week low. They pared some losses to trade down 11 percent at $10.94 in afternoon trade Monday on the New York Stock Exchange. The case is In re: HRB Tax Group Inc et al vs. HSBC Bank USA National Association et al, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Missouri, No. 10-01946.
