 CHICAGO/NEW YORK  (Reuters) - CME Group Inc ( CME.O ) said on Monday that it had begun providing clearing to the $400 trillion interest-rate swaps market, the largest of the opaque markets that lawmakers are forcing onto more transparent venues. 

 Mortgage lenders Fannie Mae ( FNMA.OB ) and Freddie Mac ( FMCC.OB ), whose $3 trillion in rate swaps make them the biggest potential user of such services, have signed on with CME, as has bond fund giant PIMCO. Goldman Sachs Group Inc ( GS.N ) and JPMorgan Chase and Co ( JPM.N ) are among 10 dealers who will also use the service, CME said. Sweeping Wall Street reform passed over the summer will force most of the $615 trillion derivatives market onto exchanges and into clearinghouses by next summer, a requirement lawmakers hope will protect the financial system from a repeat of the 2008 crisis. The rules have created a lucrative opening for clearinghouse operators like CME, which also is the biggest U.S. futures exchange operator. "It's symptomatic of the continuous march toward government-sponsored transparency," said Vince Lanci, managing partner and metals portfolio manager at Echobay Private Equity, a fund that invests in the exchange sector. "Exchanges are the new banks."

CME Clearing will provide an "open access" and "futures-style central counterparty clearing" service, Chicago-based CME Group said, meaning that it will allow multiple trading platforms to hook up to its clearing services. BlackRock Inc ( BLK.N ) and Citadel are the other two buyside participants in CME Group's long-awaited launch. CME will compete with London-based LCH.Clearnet, which already does a brisk business in dealer-to-dealer rate swaps, as well as NASDAQ OMX Group Inc's ( NDAQ.O ) majority-owned International Derivatives Clearing Group, which as the first U.S. swaps clearer has $400 million in open interest on its books to date. But CME, as the biggest global clearer of interest-rate futures, has a potential leg-up on its rivals because it can offer clients discounts on the amount of money they must put up to back their swaps, as long as they have offsetting futures positions. CME said it is working with its regulator, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, to obtain permission to offer margin reductions. As swaps users begin to shift their business onto clearinghouses, CME and others may capture some of the revenue that until now has been controlled by the banks that control the swaps market. "The franchises and revenue streams that banks once had are going to be forced on more transparent platforms." Lanci said. Still, the transition will likely take some time, said Sandler O'Neill analyst Rich Repetto. "We expect migration will likely proceed slowly at first with some key players expected to initially clear both "test trades" and a limited number of "official" trades on the platform," Repetto said in a note to investors on Monday. CME shares were up $10.94 or 4 percent at $278.45 on the Nasdaq at midday. (Reporting by Ann Saphir and Jonathan Spicer; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn and  Matthew Lewis )
