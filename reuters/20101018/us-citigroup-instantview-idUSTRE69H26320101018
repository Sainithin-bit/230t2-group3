 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Citigroup Inc ( C.N ) reported a third consecutive quarterly profit on Monday, earning $2.2 billion as losses slowed and the bank set aside less money to cover bad loans. 

 The third-largest U.S. bank by assets swung to a third-quarter profit of 7 cents per share, from a year-earlier loss to shareholders of 27 cents per share, or $3.2 billion. A tax benefit had helped Citigroup report net income of $101 million in the year-earlier period. The results beat analyst expectations for a profit of 6 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Citigroup shares were up 9 cents, or 2.3 percent, in premarket electronic trading. The following is reaction from industry analysts and investors: ANTHONY POLINI, ANALYST, RAYMOND JAMES "We're going to give Citi a big fat check mark...Core revenues increased slightly more than we thought." "The sale of Citi Holdings is obviously progressing nicely, as is the sale of the government stock. Those continue to be two positive catalysts as those pools get reduced...It's encouraging to see when you look at the mortgage purchase reserves, in Citi Holdings, those declined sequentially...It kind of fits what JPMorgan said on their conference call that they expect the losses to persist, but the worst is behind them...But the level of uncertainty is what the market plays on and until we can be more certain about foreclosure issues etc, these stocks could have a ceiling on them. " "You know what's nice? Three quarters in a row: profitable. Four quarters in a row: problem loans go down. Five quarters in a row: Loan losses decline. If you had any doubts or you were on the fence about whether or not Citi is back -- Citi is back!" MATT MCCORMICK, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, BAHL & GAYNOR INVESTMENT COUNSEL, INC, CINCINNATI "What concerns me is the decline in revenues. It's a problem for all the banks now -- they have trouble raising revenues. "Reducing loan loss reserves is not something you can do indefinitely -- eventually, they'll get to the point where they'll say, 'we can't keep going down this path.'" JOSHUA RAYMOND, MARKET STRATEGIST, CITY INDEX, LONDON "The (Citigroup) results are largely in line. The results (from U.S. banks) so far are certainly not as outstanding as the previous two quarters. Market expectations this quarter have been more in line with earnings compared to the previous two quarters when expectations were pretty downbeat and they're being met as opposed to massively outperforming as in previous quarters." MICHAEL NIX, CO-CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, GREENWOOD CAPITAL ASSOCIATES, GREENWOOD, SOUTH CAROLINA "It looks to be similar to what we've seen thus far and probably what we expect to see going forward. Obviously, continued credit improvement is helping things here. Beating by a couple of pennies is always a good thing, but they had the net release of $2 billion versus $1.5 billion in the prior quarter -- so we're continuing to see that credit improvement is helping the banks." "I think a lot of people will be looking for them to give....a continued vision for what their strategy is for the various lines of business. They have been fairly aggressive in divesting lines of business, I think a lot of people will be looking at that and saying what should we expect for the next 6 to 12 months plus as it relates to their business mix? Some color on that would be helpful." DAVID MORRISON, MARKET STRATEGIST, GFT GLOBAL MARKETS, LONDON "There is the built in concern about the mortgage portfolio and the foreclosure issue ... There is a feeling that there could be a fallout in the sector especially with the top six, too-big-to-fail banks. What's just beneath the surface here? Or how deep is this problem goes? We are looking at not just foreclosures but also some other whispers underneath the surface about problems of securitization." "The financials were very quick to lead us out when we had the first round of QE. They are certainly not the sector that will be leading us into the next stage if we are to get QE2." MICHAEL HOLLAND, MONEY MANAGER, HOLLAND & CO, NEW YORK: "Earnings are okay and revenues are light, but the key will be their comments on foreclosures." "They will have to give some indication that the problem is one that is easily handled, and they can define when it will be over. I doubt they can do that, but that's what the investors would like to hear." "The results were pretty much in line with what was expected, but with all the negative psychology toward banks is not going to move the needle in terms of share movement."
