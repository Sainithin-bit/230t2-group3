 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Hasbro Inc HAS.N reported a higher-than-expected quarterly profit on strong demand for its preschool toys and boys' lines such as Nerf foam products, sending its shares to an all-time high. 

 The No. 2 toy company's results came as a relief to investors after larger rival Mattel Inc ( MAT.O ) missed quarterly sales estimates on an unexpected decline at its Fisher-Price infant and preschool toy business. Mattel executives also said consumers were still wary ahead of the holiday shopping season. Hasbro Chief Executive Officer Brian Goldner was far more confident, saying retailers were adding space in stores for toys and that there were no major delays in stocking inventory. "Certainly, we expect a very robust holiday season," he told analysts on a conference call. Chief Operating Officer David Hargreaves said Hasbro was happy with retailer inventory levels. "We're looking for strong sell-through in the fourth quarter, and we think the levels of inventories support that." The company, whose brands also include Playskool and Monopoly, said it still expected an increase in full-year revenue and earnings per share, including spending for its new television network, The Hub. "Very good execution on Hasbro's side," said BMO Capital Markets analyst Gerrick Johnson, who has a "market perform" rating on the shares. "Nerf is doing very, very well. That's driving significant increases in boys, and the preschool line looks reinvigorated." Hasbro's third-quarter net income rose to $155.2 million, or $1.09 a share, from $150.4 million, or 99 cents a share, a year earlier. The profit was 5 cents a share higher than the average forecast from analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose 3 percent to $1.31 billion, topping the $1.29 billion analysts had expected. Excluding currency changes, it was up 4 percent. Hasbro shares were up 4.9 percent at $47.30 after hitting an all-time high of $48.78 earlier in the session. Mattel rose 0.5 percent. HASBRO PRESCHOOL SALES JUMP Mattel said on Friday that sales at its Fisher-Price unit had dropped 5 percent, while some Wall Street analysts were expecting an increase of up to 10 percent. The company cited a move to delay marketing programs until closer to the Christmas holidays as shoppers are more likely to buy at the last minute. It also noted shipments to U.S. retailers were a bit soft late in its most recent quarter as more chains tried to avoid getting stuck with excess inventory. Mattel executives said they did not know how the holiday season would play out. However, preschool toy sales led Hasbro's revenue growth, with a 9 percent jump in the quarter. Boys, the largest category, rose 4 percent, while Stifel Nicolaus had forecast a 1.1 percent decline. Sales of games and puzzles rose 2 percent, while girls slipped 1 percent. Hasbro's entertainment and licensing segment's revenue fell 34 percent due to declines in "Transformers" and "G.I. Joe" movie-related sales. Looking ahead, Hasbro holds licenses to make merchandise tied to 2011 movies releases such as "Transformers 3", "Thor" and "The First Avenger: Captain America." The company said the fourth quarter would reflect the largest percentage of an expected expense of 25 cents to 30 cents per share to support the launch this month of The Hub, a new children's TV network formed with Discovery Communications Inc ( DISCA.O ). The channel, launched on October 10, will replace Discovery Kids in 60 million cable and satellite homes, aiming to fill a void between networks with preschool-age programing and those with shows for 11-to-14-year-olds. Goldner said the company feels very good about the early TV ratings for the new network.
