 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Home-builder sentiment rose for the first time in five months as builders are starting to see "some flickers of interest" among potential buyers, according to a survey on Monday that continued to show weakness in the housing market. 

 The National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index rose more than expected to 16 from last month's 13. Economists polled by Reuters expected a rise to 14. A reading above 50 indicates that more builders view sales conditions as good than poor. The index has not been above 50 since April 2006. (Reporting by  Corbett B.
