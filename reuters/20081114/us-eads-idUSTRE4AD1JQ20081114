 PARIS  (Reuters) - Shares in European aerospace group EADS ( EAD.PA ) soared on Friday as it beat expectations for the third quarter and raised its 2008 profit goal, upstaging a new 341 million euro provision for delays in a top military project. 

 EADS also announced 200 million euros of new cost savings for 2011 and 2012 on top of existing restructuring plans and boasted a strong cash buffer against global financial turmoil. The Airbus parent said it had swung to a quarterly operating profit, or earnings before interest and tax, of 860 million euros compared with a 711 million euro loss a year earlier. Third-quarter sales rose 6 percent to 9.701 billion euros. The world's second-largest aerospace group behind Boeing ( BA.N ) also reported a third-quarter net profit of 679 million euros compared with a year-earlier loss of 776 million euros. EADS shares rose as much as 9.4 percent to 12.99 euros in early Paris trading, virtually erasing underperformance compared to the French CAC40  .FCHI  blue-chip index so far this year. Planemaker subsidiary Airbus posted a 789 million euro operating profit on revenues of 5.859 billion euros. Analysts had on average forecast third-quarter group EBIT of 679 million euros on revenues of 9.234 billion, including Airbus EBIT of 179 million on revenues of 5.944 billion, according to a Reuters poll. They had forecast net profit of 377 million. EADS said it was well-placed to weather the financial crisis with a record 9 billion euros in net cash, but again blamed the propulsion system that includes the engine for delays to the A400M, a 20 billion euro European NATO troop and cargo lifter. EADS, which last year took 1.4 billion euros in provisions and pushed Europe's biggest military project back by 6-12 months, on Friday announced a new third-quarter charge of 341 million euros and said there could be more delays. EADS also acknowledged problems with "equipment and systems integration," a phrase echoing problems blamed for 2-year delays in its biggest civil project, the A380 superjumbo. Once the A400M schedule is clear, charges will be updated again, it said. "EADS is more determined than ever to get this complex programme under control," Chief Executive Louis Gallois said. NEW COST SAVINGS EADS has clashed with a consortium of British, French and German engine makers over delays in testing the plane's engines and is in talks with buyers to try to waive delivery penalties. France has said it is prepared to discuss a compromise but Germany has taken a tough line saying the contract must stand. EADS said in slides for analysts that early talks to change the A400M contract were "encouraging but far from being finalised." EADSsaid it would likely exceed its full-year EBIT forecast of 1.8 billion euros after making 2 billion euros in the first nine months. "This excludes any additional impact for the A400M, due to the uncertainties of the programme," it said. It doubled its forecast for 2008 free cash flow excluding customer financing to more than 2 billion euros ($2.50 billion). EADS has until recently been grappling with a weak dollar that penalises its revenues when converted back into euros. The company said the prospect of economic slowdown overshadowed the dollar's recovery and relief from record oil prices that have severely squeezed airline customers. It said a slower market could lead to order deferrals and cancellations, "but visibility on this is limited." Airbus has already suspended increases in aircraft production. EADS announced a new cost-saving plan on top of its Power8 restructuring programme involving 10,000 job cuts at Airbus. The four-year Power8 plan aims to achieve 2.1 billion euros of recurring EBIT savings at Airbus by 2010. In July EADS extended this by another 1 billion for 2011-2012 and spread about a third of the extra burden across the rest of the group. On Friday, EADS said it would seek additional savings of at least 200 million euros in 2011-12 through further cost-savings and integration between its headquarters and divisions.
