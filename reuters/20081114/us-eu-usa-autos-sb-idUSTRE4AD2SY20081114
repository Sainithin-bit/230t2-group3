 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - The European Commission said on Friday it would study any U.S. support for its auto sector to see whether such a move complied with rules on state aid, and if necessary would take the case to the World Trade Organization. 

 "We are going to study in detail the aid which has been proposed to the U.S. automobile industry to ensure any aid is in compliance with the rules of international trade," a Commission spokeswoman told a regular briefing. "If it was illegal state aid, we would react at the WTO," she said, stressing any such action was hypothetical for now. (Reporting by Marcin Grawjewski and  Mark John ; editing by  Dale Hudson )
