 HELSINKI  (Reuters) - The world's top cellphone maker, Nokia Oyj, said the mobile phone market would be weaker than it expected in the fourth quarter due to the economic slowdown and was set to fall further next year. Following are analyst comments on the news. 

 GEOFF BLABER, CCS INSIGHT "The fact that this warning has come just four weeks since the 3Q08 results were released suggests that Nokia has seen significant deterioration in market conditions across multiple markets. This shows that the economic climate is adversely impacting everyone from the manufacturer to the operator, distributor, retailer and consumer." "Nokia's warning is consistent with our current perspective on demand in the final quarter. Rather than flat year-on-year growth in 4Q08, it is now looking like the market could decline by 2 percent if not more." HANNU RAUHALA, POHJOLA BANK "Next year's outlook was the biggest news, and also how fast consumer demand has fallen in the recent weeks." "There have been some expectations that the market would not grow next year. But (the forecast) that it would fall, that is a slight surprise. There have been expectations of slight or no growth next year, but this a negative surprise." JACOB PEDERSEN, SYDBANK "It's a negative announcement regarding the fourth quarter. It has not been looking good for consumers and the negative trend has been intensified over the last couple of weeks, which Nokia is now feeling. This is going to impact Nokia during the Christmas season. Due to the financial crisis, the sales pace is going to slow down dramatically. I will keep my 'Underweight' recommendation of the share." NEIL MAWSTON, STRATEGY ANALYTICS "It is a shocker but not entirely unexpected. We have been hearing about operators and distributors reducing their handset stock to an absolute minimum, due to a credit shortage, for the past few weeks. We think underlying demand from consumers worldwide is still relatively healthy, but many trade buyers appear to be struggling with finance and they are consequently stocking up with fewer phones." "This feels very much like a supply-side recession in the handset industry. As a result of Nokia's warning, our revised numbers call for global handset shipments to reach 325 million units in Q4 2008, down 1 percent year-on-year." TERO KUITTINEN, GLOBAL CROWN CAPITAL "The warning dovetails well with Qualcomm and Intel -- rapid recent deterioration of consumer electronics demand. I don't think anyone expects 2009 handset volumes to be up -- markets had already discounted at least 5 percent volume decline before the Nokia warning. The timing of the warning is unusual -- midpoint of the quarter is very early in the handset business, where the second half of 4Q is king. It is this timing that is probably the most unsettling element of Nokia's warning." HELENA NORDMAN-KNUTSON, OHMAN FONDKOMMISSION "This was probably expected by many, and it is good that it came now and that they didn't wait until the capital markets day. It's expected because there have been so many signals in the market about lower volumes, so it should not have come as a surprise in my opinion." JYSKE BANK "Of course Nokia's earnings will be negatively impacted by the lower purchasing appetite of consumers. Nokia is forecasting lower (global) unit sales in 2009 than this year where we had expected zero growth." "We believe the company's forecast is conservative and reflects their poor visibility at present. The share is moderately down, which reflects of course that the outlook downgrade was not unexpected. We retain our 'Buy' recommendation on Nokia."
