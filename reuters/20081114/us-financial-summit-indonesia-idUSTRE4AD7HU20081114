 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Leaders of the G20 countries meeting at the weekend in Washington must deliver results quickly, Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono said on Friday. 

 "We need to quickly restore confidence and stabilize the financial markets, protect the real economy and reform the financial architecture," he said. "We will have to make sure that this process produces immediate results sooner rather than later," he said in a luncheon speech in the U.S. capital. (Reporting by  Paul Eckert )
