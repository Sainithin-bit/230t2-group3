 ROME/PARIS  (Reuters) - Italy joined Germany in recession in the third quarter, and while France narrowly avoiding joining the club, the euro zone economy looked virtually guaranteed to suffer the same fate. 

 Data at 1000 GMT on Friday is expected to show the euro zone economy satisfied the technical definition of recession by suffering two consecutive quarters of contraction, with economists' gloom mounting after Italy issued data that was weaker than forecast. The euro zone's third biggest economy shrank 0.5 percent in the third quarter from the previous three months, its sharpest quarterly decline since the end of 1998 and the same rate of decline reported on Thursday by Germany, Europe's biggest economy. With Spain's economy suffering its first contraction in 15 years in the third quarter, an unexpected rise in French gross domestic product was not seen enough to stave off a recession in the euro zone. "We now expect the euro zone to show a quarterly GDP fall of 0.3 or 0.4 percent in the third quarter," Gilles Moec at Bank of America in London said after the release of the Italian data. Economists polled by Reuters before the release of weaker-than-expected German data had on average predicted the euro zone economy would contract by 0.2 percent in the third quarter. European Central Bank Executive Board member Juergen Stark told German radio on Friday that ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet has not ruled out lowering interest rates further. Weak euro zone data will only buttress financial market expectations of such a rate cut. "Today's release provides a further piece of evidence supporting our view that the ECB will deliver another 50 bp (in rate cuts) at its December meeting, to subsequently bring them down to 2 percent by the second quarter of 2009," said Paolo Pizzoli at ING Financial Markets. The ECB has already cut interest rates by a full percentage point to 3.25 percent over the past six weeks, and Trichet said last week that a further cut could follow in December as inflation continues to subside. Calls for rate cuts are expected to grow as jobs are lost across the euro zone. Carmaker Renault said in September it was cutting 6,000 jobs and Adecco, the world's biggest staffing agency, said in October it planned to cut up to 600 jobs in France and will merge about 75 branches as slowing economic growth forces it to cut costs globally. The slowdown is not just confined to the euro zone's biggest economies. The Dutch economy failed to grow in both the second and third quarters, Statistics Netherlands said on Friday. Austrian economic growth slowed to 0.1 percent in the third quarter from a revised 0.3 percent in the second quarter as a the global economic downturn led to a decline of exports, research institute WIFO said on Friday.
