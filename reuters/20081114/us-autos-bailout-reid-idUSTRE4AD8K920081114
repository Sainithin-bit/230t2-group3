 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid on Friday said Bush's proposal to drop a requirement for U.S. automakers to use an existing $25 billion in aid on energy efficiency is "unacceptable". 

 Reid also said the Treasury Department should use its existing authority to help automakers which would not require congressional action. (Reporting by  Richard Cowan )
