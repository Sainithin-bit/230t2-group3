 (Reuters) - Ninety percent of Merrill Lynch & Co Inc MER.N financial advisers who were offered bonuses to stay on with Bank of America Corp ( BAC.N ) had signed up for them as of late Thursday, the Wall Street Journal said, citing people familiar with the firm. 

 Last month, BofA reached out to Merrill Lynch's 15,500 financial advisers, offering retention packages to the group which the bank has described as Merrill's "crown jewel." Friday is the deadline for the brokers to accept the offer, the paper said. No one at Bank of America could immediately be reached for comment.
