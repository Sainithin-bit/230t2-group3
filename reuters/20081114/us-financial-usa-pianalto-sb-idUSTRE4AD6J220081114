 CLEVELAND, Ohio  (Reuters) - The United States faces a worse than average recession after financial markets broke down in September and further clouded the outlook, a top Federal Reserve policy-maker said on Friday. 

 "At the moment, the signs point to a recession beyond just a 'garden variety' downturn," Cleveland Federal Reserve President Sandra Pianalto told the City Club of Cleveland. "The length and severity of the recession will depend on how quickly credit markets return to normal," said Pianalto, a voter on the Fed's interest rate-setting committee this year. The Fed has slashed benchmark interest rates 4.25 percentage points to 1 percent since September 2007 and is expected to cut again as a global credit crunch, sparked by a collapse in U.S. housing, pushes the economy into recession. Pianalto said that the return of the fed funds rate to its lowest level since June 2004 reflected the U.S. central bank's outlook for several quarters of subdued growth, and she pointedly emphasized that more action might be warranted. "We'll continue to look at the forecasts and continue to make adjustments as needed," she said. Pianalto said that there was evidence from the interbank and commercial paper markets that "progress is being made" in thawing frozen markets after forceful Fed action, which also includes a fleet of emergency measures to boost liquidity. But she said that conditions won't return back to normal until banks resume lending to each other, house prices steady and turnover in the market for mortgages, car and student loans returns. "We are not there quite yet. And even when markets return to what is typically thought of as 'normal,' changes will still be needed for the long term," Pianalto said. These measures will include tighter loan underwriting standards, stricter financial service industry regulation and more government oversight. "Government and private actions, I'm convinced, will make strong efforts at having our financial markets become more transparent and less complex," she said. The credit crunch has fueled a flight to quality that has driven the dollar sharply back from record lows on foreign exchange markets set earlier this year. Pianalto ducked a direct question from the audience about the currency, but acknowledged that dollar played a role in shaping export demand. "I can't comment on the value of the dollar. We've seen fluctuations in the value of the dollar, and when we've been through periods when the dollar was weaker, that has helped our manufacturing sector," she said.
