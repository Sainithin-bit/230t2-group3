 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. stocks and crude oil fell on Friday as data showing much of Europe in recession, along with a record drop in U.S. retail sales in October, prompted risk aversion amid a deteriorating global economic outlook. 

 Gold futures surged more than 5 percent in heavy buying ahead of a Group of 20 summit meeting in Washington starting on Saturday, but breakthroughs are not expected in efforts to subdue a credit crisis that has rocked the world's markets. The price of U.S. and euro zone government debt rose, as did the U.S. dollar and the yen against the euro, as investors took cover in less-risky assets. "People are going to wait on the sidelines and see what comes out of (the G20 meeting) before they start to take a view with respect to what's going on next week," said Robert Blake, senior currency strategist at State Street Global Markets in Boston. "Generally speaking, we would be hesitant to say this is the bottom for sentiment," he said. Data on Friday showed the 15-nation euro zone has fallen into its first recession since the currency bloc was created in 1999. A late-day rally fizzled on Wall Street, sending stocks down for the fourth time this week and stripping away more than half of the gains from Thursday's big rally. The Dow Jones industrial average slid 337.15 points, or 3.82 percent, at 8,498.10, the Standard & Poor's 500 Index fell 37.98 points, or 4.17 percent, at 873.31. The Nasdaq Composite Index lost 79.85 points, or 5.00 percent, at 1,516.85. For the week, the Dow fell 5 percent, the S&P 500 shed 6.2 percent and the Nasdaq lost 7.9 percent. European shares managed to close higher, but pared gains as the report of a whopping 2.8 percent drop in U.S. retail sales in October spooked investors, who also were unnerved by more signs of bleak holiday sales. Two key U.S. retailers, department store operator J.C. Penney and teen apparel seller Abercrombie & Fitch Co, warned of worsening results ahead as shoppers rein in spending. They both reported lower quarterly profits and said soft conditions would extend into next year. "We started the day in an equity rally but the driving force remains risk-aversion and deleveraging," said Cyril Beuzit, head of interest rate strategy at BNP Paribas in London. Bonds will perform well through year-end, he said. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index ended 0.8 percent higher at 859.58 points, off a day's high of 879.19. Oil shares led the advance, with BP, Royal Dutch Shell and Total up between 3.2 percent and 3.6 percent. Economic worries were compounded by renewed concerns about the credit market, two days after U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson proposed changes to the government's $700 billion bank bailout. The interbank lending rates for dollars rose for a second day, raising doubts about the Treasury's effectiveness to ease credit conditions and the overall economy. Oil prices fell as the news on the euro zone recession and U.S. retail sales stirred concerns of a further drop in fuel demand. U.S. crude settled down $1.20 at $57.04. London Brent crude for January dropped $2.00 at $54.24. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note rose 38/32 in price to yield 3.71 percent. The 2-year U.S. Treasury note gained 2/32 in price to yield 1.20 percent. The dollar rose against a basket of major currencies, with the U.S. Dollar Index up 0.67 percent at 87.028. Against the yen, the dollar fell 0.76 percent at 96.84. The December gold contract settled up $37.50 to $742.50 an ounce in New York. Stock markets rose overnight in Asia, although they pared sharp gains by half. Japan's Nikkei was among the region's leaders, with a 2.7 percent advance, after earlier rising as much as 5.5 percent. The MSCI index of Asia-Pacific stocks outside Japan was up 1.6 percent, after earlier rising as much as 3.2 percent.
