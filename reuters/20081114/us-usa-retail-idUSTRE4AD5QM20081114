 ATLANTA  (Reuters) - Two major U.S. retailers said on Friday that holiday cheer may be hard to find this year as shoppers look like they will be reining in spending due to the worsening jobs picture and growing economic weakness. 

 Retailers J.C. Penney Inc ( JCP.N ) and Abercrombie & Fitch Co ( ANF.N ) reported lower quarterly earnings and said soft conditions would extend into next year as U.S. government data showed a record decline in retail sales in October. "Consumers went into hibernation in October while concerns about the economy were at a peak," said NRF Chief Economist Rosalind Wells. "As economic uncertainty went from bad to worse, shoppers pulled back on everything but the basics to weather the storm." The Standard & Poor's Retail index .RLX was down 5 percent on Friday afternoon. Penney, the department store operator, and Abercrombie & Fitch, a clothing retailer for teens and young adults, forecast profit for the current quarter sharply lower than estimates. Their weak results echoed those a day earlier from mid-priced retailer Kohl's Corp ( KSS.N ) and upscale chain Nordstrom Inc ( JWN.N ), which cut their full-year forecasts. "Everything we can control we're controlling, to battle the macro forces we can't control," Penney Chief Executive Mike Ullman said on a call with analysts. "If you look at employment, housing, if you look at the credit availability for consumers, one has to assume it is going to be continue to be sluggish" through the holiday season, Ullman added. Amid the global financial crisis, shoppers have curbed their spending on TVs and other discretionary items to focus on necessities as rising unemployment and tight credit dents their purchasing power. This week, electronics retail leader Best Buy Co ( BBY.N ) cut its full-year forecast, citing "seismic changes" in consumer behavior. BY THE NUMBERS While concerns about the economy have been around for months, new data confirmed the worst fears on Friday morning. The U.S. Commerce Department said retail sales slumped 2.8 percent last month, the largest decline since the series began in 1992. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a 2.0 percent fall in October sales. At Abercrombie, third-quarter net income fell 46 percent to $63.9 million, or 72 cents per share, from $117.6 million, or $1.29 per share, a year earlier. Sales fell 8 percent to $896.3 million, while sales at stores open at least a year fell 14 percent. During a conference call, Abercrombie CEO Mike Jeffries did not answer a question on whether he would sign his contract, up for renewal soon, fueling speculation he would retire. "We believe Jeffries is the driving force behind the Abercrombie brand and without his leadership in this environment, we see increased risk," wrote Marie Driscoll of Standard & Poor's Equity Research. Penney's quarterly profit fell 53 percent to $124 million, or 55 cents a share, from $261 million, or $1.17 a share, a year earlier. Sales fell 8.7 percent to $4.3 billion, while same-store sales decreased 10.1 percent. Abercrombie shares fell $3.19, or 14 percent, to $19.25 in early afternoon trade on the New York Stock Exchange, while Penney was down $1.59, or 8 percent, to $17.69. Kohl's was off 80 cents, or 2.6 percent, at $29.77, and Nordstrom sank 76 cents, or nearly 6 percent, to $12.20.
