 PARIS  (Reuters) - The European Union might complain to the World Trade Organization about U.S. plans to help its stricken car industry, European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso said on Friday. 

 Democrats in the United States Congress are trying to draw up a $25 billion bail-out for American automakers, who are struggling to survive the financial crisis. "We are in the process of analyzing the plan. The plan has not yet been presented yet. Of course, if it is illegal state aid, we will act at a WTO level," Barroso told Europe 1 radio. "In any case, we are in the process of preparing a (European) plan that is not discriminatory. It is a plan that supports cleaner, more environmentally-friendly cars," he added. Data released on Friday showed European new car registrations fell for the sixth consecutive month in October, dropping 14.5 percent. U.S. auto sales have also slumped, hitting 25-year lows, and American carmakers have called for federal government help to survive the economic downturn. However, U.S. lawmakers are split over whether to bail out the industry and U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said any federal aid for U.S. automakers must ensure their long-term viability.
