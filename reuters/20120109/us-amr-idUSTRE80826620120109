 (Reuters) - AMR Corp ( AAMRQ.PK ), the bankrupt parent of American Airlines, on Monday said it would cut service between Chicago and New Delhi and between Dallas/Fort Worth and Burbank, California, a move that will eliminate 150 jobs. 
 AMR said the service cuts will conclude its operations in Delhi and Burbank. The company said the reductions were not linked to the bankruptcy. AMR filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in November, citing uncompetitive costs. The carrier has said its reorganization may lead to job cuts. "The changes announced today resulting in schedule adjustments and employee reductions are related to normal business changes and aren't specifically related to restructuring," the company said in a memo to its U.S.-based managers. "Our objective is to make our company competitive and more efficient in an increasingly challenging industry," AMR said. AMR's Chicago-to-New Delhi service will end on March 1. Service on AMR's Dallas/Fort Worth to Burbank route will end on Feb 9. The job cuts will be ground-worker positions, represented by the Transport Workers Union. The airline said it is evaluating other parts of its operations and may make additional changes to its service. (Reporting By Kyle Peterson; editing by Carol Bishopric)
