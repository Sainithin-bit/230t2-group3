 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Home prices fell for a fourth straight month in November as distressed sales continued to weigh on prices, data analysis firm CoreLogic said on Monday. 
 CoreLogic's ( CLGX.N ) home price index fell 1.4 percent in November from the previous month. Compared with November of last year, prices were down 4.3 percent, steeper than the 3.7 percent year-over-year decline seen in October. Excluding distressed sales, prices were off just 0.6 percent in November on a yearly basis. Homeowners in danger of foreclosure, or in "distress," often sell their homes at a significantly reduced price. "Distressed sales continue to put downward pressure on prices and is a factor that must be addressed in 2012 for a housing recovery to become a reality," Mark Fleming, chief economist at CoreLogic, said in a statement. Of the top 100 statistical areas measured by population, 77 showed year-over-year declines, down from 80 in October. (Reporting By  Leah Schnurr ; editing by Jeffrey Benkoe)
