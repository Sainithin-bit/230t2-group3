 SYDNEY  (Reuters) - BHP Billiton ( BHP.AX )( BLT.L ), the world's biggest diversified miner, said its iron ore production rose 11 percent in the third-quarter, trailing a 39 percent expansion rate at Rio Tinto ( RIO.AX ), its main rival. 

 BHP Billiton also reported a 19 percent drop in copper output, partly due to disruptions at its Olympic Dam mine. BHP also revealed that it has uncovered possible violations of anti-corruptions laws and was cooperating with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). ANALYST COMMENT BEN POTTER, MARKET STRATEGIST, IG MARKETS: "At first glance, BHP Billiton looks to have reported a mixed set of production numbers. Total petroleum production looks to have come in shy of analysts' expectations, despite a third consecutive year-to-date production record. "Despite record iron ore production, it appears to be at the low end of consensus due to weather-related disruptions. Metallurgical coal was also adversely affected by cyclone activity in Queensland. "However, the details of the result may be overshadowed by reports from BHP Billiton that it may have discovered possible anti-corruption violations by its employees relating to certain terminated mineral exploration projects. Given the lack of detail, the market may choose sell first, ask questions later." MICHAEL BENTLEY, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, NORTHWARD CAPITAL ON PRODUCTION "It looked okay. I don't think it is anything spectacular but it is pretty much in line with expectations. "I think metallurgical coal was bit soft due to some bad weather up in Queensland. "The other thing is that copper production was a bit light and that adds to the whole scenario that the supply side on the copper industry is very tight. ON POSSIBLE VIOLATIONS OF GRAFT LAWS: "It's interesting but I wouldn't have a clue what it means. They have been very cagey as to what they told us. There is something going on but it will be a wait and see." MICHAEL BUSH, HEAD OF FIXED INCOME CREDIT RESEARCH, NATIONAL AUSTRALIA BANK "Based on the limited information, (the anti-corruption probe) is unlikely to have serious impact on the company's credit <A-plus by S&P and A1 by Moody's> rating. However, if it is applied to sales and marketing activities, it could potentially be far more serious. We need to see further details." PETER O'CONNOR, RESOURCES ANALYST, MERRILL LYNCH "Quarter-on-quarter (Q3 vs Q2), all the major units are down except petroleum; that is iron ore, copper, coal and met coal. "Some of those were known and some were seasonal or one-offs. Copper was expected to be weak but it was weaker than expected. "On a year-on-year basis it looks OK, except for copper, but I think most people will be trimming earnings forecast just a bit on these numbers -- perhaps a cent or two (per share) but nothing major." TIM SCHROEDERS, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, PENGANA CAPITAL ON PRODUCTION: "The Q3 production was weaker than expected. There's not a lot of joy in terms of positive surprises. "Copper was bad. Manganese was a positive, beating expectations. Metallurgical coal was weak. "Zinc and gold production were slight positives but in the areas that matter and drive profitability -- iron ore, metallurgical coal and petroleum -- all fairly weak in terms of what expectations were. "There may have been less customer demand in the quarter than people had anticipated, despite the higher spot iron prices." ON POSSIBLE VIOLATIONS OF GRAFT LAWS: "I haven't digested that yet, I'm not sure what that would pertain to. Wherever there is doubt and uncertainty, it's never good for the share price. "Given they have got enough on the agenda in terms of dealing with regulators over the Pilbara joint venture, this is probably the last thing they need at this point in time." TIM BARKER, INVESTMENT ANALYST, BT INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT: "There's nothing that's unexpected -- things like the slide in copper on the back of the shaft at Roxby and the (Chile) earthquake. There was nothing wildly surprising on iron ore. It might be a little bit below the market. Given the fact that we saw no cyclones, the market might have been a little over-optimistic about (the calendar) first quarter, forgetting that it's always a slightly shorter quarter anyway."
