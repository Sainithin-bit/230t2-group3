 BOSTON  (Reuters) - State Street Corp ( STT.N ) reported higher first-quarter profit and lower unrealized losses in its investment portfolio, but investors who had hoped for even better numbers pushed down the company's shares. 

 The Boston-based company, the world's second-largest custody bank, said net profit climbed to $495 million from $476 million a year earlier as assets under management rose and it earned 8 percent more in fees for managing them. Earnings per share fell to 99 cents from $1.02 because of an increase in shares outstanding due to a capital-raise in 2009. On an operating basis, the bank earned 75 cents a share, meeting Wall Street analysts' average forecast. "Earnings were in line with expectations but revenue growth wasn't as strong as people had hoped," said Gerard Cassidy, analyst at RBC Capital Markets. First-quarter revenue was $2.3 billion, up from $2 billion a year ago. State Street shares were down 3.2 percent to $45.75 in premarket trade. The bank said it further cut the risk in its investment portfolio, where unrealized losses narrowed to $1.44 billion from $2.29 billion at the end of the 2009 fourth quarter. Unrealized losses have worried analysts and weighed on the company's stock price. Investment fees at the 272-year old company, which also earns money for keeping records and providing account and other services to investment managers, rose 8 percent to $1.54 billion. But net customer cash flows were modestly negative during the quarter, State Street said. The company reported a 21 percent rise in expenses from operations to $1.56 billion as salaries and employee benefits rose. Assets under custody increased to $19.04 trillion from $15.03 trillion, while assets under management climbed to $1.93 trillion from $1.4 trillion.
