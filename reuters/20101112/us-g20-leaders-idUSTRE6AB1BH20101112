 SEOUL  (Reuters) - Leaders of the Group of 20 major economies held news conferences after a two-day summit in Seoul. The following are highlights. 

 * denotes new entry - - - - PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA On G20: "The work that we do here is not always going to seem dramatic. It's not always going to be immediately world-changing. But step by step what we're doing is building stronger international mechanisms and institutions that will help stabilize the economy, ensure economic growth and reduce some tensions." On China: "It (the yuan) is undervalued and China spends enormous amounts of value intervening in the market to keep it undervalued. So we've said it is important for China, in a gradual fashion to transition to a market-based foreign exchange system." Market-based exchange "is the best way to assure that everybody benefits from trade rather than just some. My expectation is that China is going to make progress on this issue. We understand that this is not solved over night, but it needs to be dealt with and I'm confident that it can be." On tax policy: "I am going to meet with both the Republican and Democratic leaders late next week and we are going to discuss how we move forward. My number one priority is making sure that we make the middle class tax cuts permanent. I don't want to see their income taxes spike up, not only because they need relief, after having gone through a horrendous recession, but also because it would be bad for the economy. Obama said he continues to believe keeping tax cuts for the rich "would be a mistake and we can't afford it." On exports: "No nation should assume that their path to prosperity is paved simply with exports to the United States." On currencies: "Exchange rates must reflect economic realities... Emerging economies need to allow for currencies that are market driven. This is something that I raised with President Hu of China and we will closely watch the appreciation of China's currency." BRITISH PRIME MINISTER DAVID CAMERON On China: "There is progress on this issue of imbalances, slowly, slowly China is moving into a position of actually increasing domestic consumption, rebalancing its economy." On G20: "I always said it (the summit) wasn't going to be heroic, but I think it's good and steady progress." On EU budget talks with Germany, France and Italy: "We are sticking to that approach (limiting the rise to 2.9 pct ) and that is very very firm indeed. They were extremely staunch when I asked them to be." JAPANESE PRIME MINISTER NAOTO KAN "The financial crisis itself has passed its peak and the leaders shared the view that G20 must play its role in a new phase and collaborate in the process of recovery from the crisis. "We decided to discuss guidelines in the first half of next year ... and the task was handed to France who chairs G20 next year... I take it that G20 is taking root in a positive sense." * RUSSIAN PRESIDENT DMITRI MEDVEDEV "There is a number of requests to join BRIC. In particular an application by the South African republic. We on the whole view this request positively and there is a consolidated position regarding this request aiming BRIC members." CANADA PRIME MINISTER STEPHEN HARPER "G20 credibility does depend on showing results ... we cannot get out of this with beggar-thy-neighbor policies. We need instead to continue to coordinate our actions going forward. The recovery is fragile. We continue to make progress on these issues." On imbalances and currencies: "We did not resolve those issues here ... these are not going to be easy issues to resolve but I think we've got everyone talking the same language, everyone understanding longer term what has to be done." "We're keeping things at least on a path that is viable." "I don't think there's anything here that speaks to a collapse in the global economy, or an immediate problem." "I don't think the fact that we aren't there yet, we haven't resolved all these problems, means we will fall back. In fact, I think to the contrary. I think everyone around the table realizes there are risks and they will avoid certain actions." SOUTH KOREA PRESIDENT LEE MYUNG-BAK On capital controls: "Countries with reserve currencies may be able to print money, but the other countries maybe hurt when funds rush in. And so the G20 now allows countries to introduce macro prudential measures to mitigate the damage." On currencies: "On the foreign exchange rate issue, principles were agreed at the finance ministers' meeting, but there was no word on when and up to how much we will implement them. But we have set the date at the summit. Therefore, that makes a significant progress. I think the world (markets) will get stabilized in this regard." On development agenda: "The legitimacy of the G20 as a forum can only be secured when they can contribute to the development of the more than 170 countries who are not part of the forum."
