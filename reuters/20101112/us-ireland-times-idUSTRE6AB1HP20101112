 DUBLIN  (Reuters) - Informal contacts are under way between Brussels, Berlin and other capitals to assess their readiness to activate a 750 mln euro fund for Ireland if it seeks such a rescue, the Irish Times reported on Friday. 

 Ireland has warned that a surge in its borrowing costs to record highs has become "very serious" and the EU has said it is ready to act should Dublin require a rescue from its euro partners. Dublin has not asked for such assistance. The Irish Times said it had established, however, that "informal contacts are under way between Brussels, Berlin and other capitals to assess their readiness to activate the 750 billion euro rescue fund in the event of an application from Dublin."
