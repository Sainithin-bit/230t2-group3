 SINGAPORE  (Reuters) - Singapore Airlines (SIA), the world's second largest airline by market value, said on Friday it has put one of its three affected A380 aircraft back into service after precautionary engine changes. 

 SIA spokesman Nicholas Ionides said the second aircraft is expected to return to service by Saturday. The airline decided on Wednesday to replace engines on three of its Airbus A380 planes after finding oil stains on them, almost a week after Australian rival Qantas grounded its A380 fleet due to an engine failure. "Singapore Airlines has completed precautionary engine changes as prescribed by Rolls Royce on one of our three A380 aircraft, which has returned to service," Ionides said in an email statement. "A second A380 is expected to be returned to service by tomorrow (13 Nov 2010), after an engine change is completed. Work on the third A380 aircraft is ongoing," he added without elaborating when the third aircraft will return to service. Qantas decided to ground all of its six A380s since last Thursday when a Rolls-Royce engine partly disintegrated mid-flight, forcing the fully laden A380 to make an emergency landing in Singapore. The incident was the biggest incident to date for the world's largest passenger jet. On Thursday Europe's aviation regulator (EASA) said fire from an oil leak was the likely cause of last week's engine failure of a Qantas A380 plane and ordered stringent inspections on superjumbos using Rolls-Royce engines. Ionides reiterated that SIA is concurrently inspecting its entire A380 fleet in compliance with the airworthiness directive set out by EASA. To minimize service disruptions to its customers, SIA has decided to deploy Boeing 747-400s and Boeing 777s in some routes to Sydney and Melbourne which was been previously served by the A380s. Singapore Airlines operates 11 A380 passenger jet and was the first carrier to receive the delivery of the aircraft. (Reporting by Harry Suhartono)
