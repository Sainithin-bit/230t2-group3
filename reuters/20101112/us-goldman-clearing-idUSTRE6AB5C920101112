 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc ( GS.N ) has stopped providing clearing services for some of the Wall Street bank's smallest U.S. clients, Bloomberg reported on Friday, citing unnamed sources. 

 Clients that manage less than $5 million were the target, though not all were declined the clearing service, the article said. It added Goldman was shedding clients that are riskier, have lower growth prospects, and are more focused on retail. A Goldman spokesman declined to comment. Wall Street's prime brokerage business has been pressured this year, due partly to increased competition to provide the services and also because funds are borrowing fewer individual stocks for short selling, according to executives. The biggest prime brokers, Goldman, Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ), and JPMorgan Chase & Co ( JPM.N ), have had the smallest growth rates this year, according to data from AR Magazine. Dean Backer, Goldman's prime-brokerage leader, said in an interview several weeks ago that the bank had about 800 prime brokerage clients. That figure is down from its pre-financial crisis peak as many hedge funds closed during the downturn, or smaller funds turned to mini prime brokers, which pool assets of smaller funds. Goldman provides clearing services for mini primes. Goldman's clearing unit -- which stands between traders, guaranteeing their obligations -- is separate from its prime brokerage unit, though the two are closely connected.
