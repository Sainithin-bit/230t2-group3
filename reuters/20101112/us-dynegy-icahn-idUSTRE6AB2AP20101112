 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Billionaire investor Carl Icahn said he may bid for Dynegy Inc ( DYN.N ) if shareholders vote down the struggling power company's deal to be bought by private equity firm Blackstone Group ( BX.N ). 

 Icahn, Dynegy's largest shareholder, has been opposed to the takeover since October, and said earlier on Friday that he would offer a $2 billion line of credit to Dynegy. He also said that he planned to vote against the deal. In a letter to Dynegy Chief Executive Bruce Williamson, Icahn suggested the company should engage "in a prompt, even handed, open marketing process for the entire company" if the Blackstone Group deal is voted down by shareholders next week. "While we have not determined to do so, we reserve the right to be a bidder in this process," Icahn said in the letter, which was filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday. Icahn and hedge fund Seneca Capital, Dynegy's two largest shareholders, believe Blackstone's $543 million bid for the company is too low, threatening the deal. Seneca has argued that the company would have more value on its own, but Dynegy has said it could face dire financial problems. "The Icahn companies, which have billions of dollars of liquidity, will today contact management to make available a $2 billion line of credit if Dynegy management cannot obtain other financing," Icahn said in a regulatory filing. Icahn also said he had acquired call options that would allow him to raise his stake in Dynegy to 12.9 percent. In October, he held nearly 10 percent. Dynegy shares rose 6 cents to close at $4.69 on the New York Stock Exchange, more than 4 percent above the Blackstone bid. The loan offer comes after Dynegy warned it would face severe financial hardship if shareholders voted down the $4.50-a-share takeover offer from private equity firm Blackstone. The deal, worth $4.7 billion including debt, must win shareholder approval at a meeting scheduled for November 17. Dynegy and Blackstone officials could not be immediately reached for comment. Dynegy said earlier on Friday afternoon that it does not believe adding more debt will help its case because it is already over-leveraged compared to its peers. "We believe adding more debt is not a step that results in greater stockholder value as it is placing more senior debt claims and interest expense ahead of the common stockholder, thereby pushing out the time when stockholders can receive any real value," Dynegy spokesman David Byford said in a statement. Icahn voiced opposition to the Blackstone deal in October but had been quiet since. Meanwhile, Seneca has launched a campaign against the Blackstone deal and plans to nominate two directors to Dynegy's board. Seneca owns a 9.29 percent stake in Dynegy. The power company has defended its deal, saying that market conditions have deteriorated since Blackstone's offer due to low and declining commodity prices, continued economic weakness and its challenging financial position. "The risks of continuing to operate as a stand-alone public company significantly outweigh the potential upside of doing so," the power company has said, forecasting $1.6 billion of negative cash flow between 2011 and 2015. Natural gas prices fell for the third straight day on Friday to around $3.80 per million British thermal units (mmbtu), due to record high inventories. Those losses have erased some recent gains that had recently pushed the price of natural gas above $4 per mmbtu. Dynegy has also said that absent the deal, it would be forced to seek financing alternatives. Top proxy advisory firm ISS has recommended that shareholders vote in favor of the takeover by Blackstone. Proxy Governance, another proxy advisory firm, made the opposite recommendation.
