 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Wendy's/Arby's Group Inc WEN.N, the No. 3 U.S. fast-food chain, said 2010 profit would be at the lower end of its previous forecast after weak sales and higher commodity costs hurt quarterly earnings, and shares fell 4 percent. 

 Sales at established restaurants, a closely watched measure, were weaker than expected during the recently completed third quarter as demand for value menu items fell off when the company cut back on advertising. Higher costs for important ingredients like beef and bacon also dented profits. "The third quarter was a difficult one and the results were simply not satisfactory," Wendy's/Arby's Chief Executive Roland Smith said on a conference call with analysts. "Softer than expected same-store sales at both brands and higher year-over-year commodity (costs) negatively impacted our results," Smith said. Sales at all Arby's North America restaurants open at least 15 months fell 5.9 percent, an improvement from the 7.4 percent decline in the second quarter but still weaker than the company expected. Arby's has tightened operations and introduced a value menu to help it better compete with Burger King and Jack in the Box ( JACK.O ), which also are grappling with high unemployment among the young men that make up their core customers. A national advertising campaign helped drive a 5.5 percent gain in same-restaurant sales at company-owned Arby's restaurants in October. But that advertising will not continue in November and December, and same-store sales will soften, the company said. "The value consumer is looking for the deal. You have to remind them of the deal," said Oppenheimer analyst Matthew DiFrisco. The company reiterated its forecast of a decline in same-store sales at Arby's North American company-operated restaurants this year. Wendy's, which has fared better than Arby's, reported a 1.7 percent decline in sales at all established North America restaurants for the latest quarter. Still, Wendy's margins fell more than expected in the third quarter after falling same-restaurant sales worsened the impact of higher commodity costs. As a result, the company now expects same-store sales at Wendy's North American company-operated restaurants to be down about 1 percent this year. It previously forecast flat results. Wendy's and Arby's both are trailing behind McDonald's Corp ( MCD.N ), which has used its large size, Dollar Menu and popular beverage expansion to pummel rivals. Its U.S. same-restaurant sales were up 5.3 percent in the third quarter. Nevertheless, the company's results were better than those posted by rivals like Jack in the Box, which saw same-restaurant sales tumble 9.4 percent its latest quarter. EXPECTATIONS TEMPERED The Wendy's and Arby's chains were suffering from neglect before their $2 billion merger in September 2008. They are rushing to catch up with rivals in restaurant appearance, operations, menu variety, value and international expansion. Their parent company reported a third-quarter net loss of $900,000, or nil cents on a per-share basis, compared with a net profit of $14.69 million, or 3 cents per share, a year earlier. The quarter, which ended on October 3, included net after-tax special charges of 5 cents a share. Revenue fell 4.7 percent to $861.2 million, short of the $882.6 million analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S had expected. For the full year, Wendy's/Arby's now expects 2010 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization at the lower end of its previous forecast of a decline of 3 percent to 5 percent. Wendy's/Arby' cut its planned capital spending for the year by $20 million, to $145 million. The company also said its board has authorized an additional $170 million for its stock buyback program, which was extended by a year to January 1, 2012. That raised the total available under the program to $250 million. Executives said they asked Nelson Peltz's Trian Fund Management, its largest investor, to make a quick decision on a takeover inquiry it received about Wendy's/Arby's in June so the company could resume share buybacks. Wendy's/Arby's also boosted its quarterly cash dividend payout by 33 percent to 2 cents a share, payable December 15 to shareholders of record on December 1. Wendy's/Arby's shares were down 20 cents at $4.84 in midday trading on the New York Stock exchange.
