 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Boeing Co ( BA.N ) on Thursday said an electric panel's failure, which then caused a fire in the surrounding insulating material, was behind the emergency landing Tuesday of one of its new 787 Dreamliner aircraft. 

 The company said it is continuing to inspect the area surrounding the panel and that process will take several days. Boeing is "determining the appropriate steps required to return the rest of the flight test fleet to flying status," according to a statement. The company, the second largest commercial plane maker after EADS' Airbus ( EAD.PA ), on Wednesday halted test flights of the 787 Dreamliner after the electrical fire forced an emergency landing in Texas.
