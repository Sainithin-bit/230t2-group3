 SEOUL  (Reuters) - A gift of a box of fruit from an elderly South Korean man to U.S. President Barack Obama's daughter sparked a full-scale security alert at this week's G20 summit in Seoul, local media reported. 

 The South Korean capital is on its highest level of alert for the meeting of leaders from the world's major economies which ends on Friday. Yonhap news agency said staff at a post office in Seoul alerted authorities to the gift addressed to Obama's younger daughter, Sasha. X-rays showed about 15 round objects that looked like fruit. Still not convinced, the staff called in a SWAT team and a sniffer dog, but the parcel was later found to contain Asian pears, Yonhap said. The gift was returned to its 70-something-year-old sender in the southern port city of Busan the same day. (Reporting by  Jeremy Laurence ; Editing by  Nick Macfie )
