 SINGAPORE  (Reuters) - G20 leaders drew a veil over weeks of bickering about economic policies on Friday and agreed to tackle global "tensions and vulnerabilities" that have raised the specter of a currency war and trade protectionism. 

 The developed and emerging nations agreed at a summit in Seoul to set vague "indicative guidelines" measuring imbalances between their multi-speed economies but, calling a timeout to let tempers cool, left the details to be discussed next year. The leaders also pledged to move toward market-determined exchange rate systems and to enhance currency flexibility to reflect economic fundamentals. The G20 added that those emerging economies with increasingly overvalued exchange rates that face an undue burden of adjustment would be justified in taking "carefully designed macro-prudential measures" to counter capital inflows. OTHER KEY POINTS IN THE G20 COMMUNIQUE - Advanced economies will guard against disorderly exchange rate movements, which will help mitigate the risk of excessive volatility in capital flows facing some emerging economies, the communique said. - G20 leaders also said they had encouraged further progress on looking at ways that "too big to fail" banks could boost their loss-absorbing capacity. - "Risks remain. Some of us are experiencing strong growth, while others face high levels of unemployment and sluggish recovery. Uneven growth and widening imbalances are fueling the temptation to diverge from global solutions into uncoordinated actions. However, uncoordinated policy actions will only lead to worse outcomes for all." - Leaders also agreed that there was a critical, but narrow, window of opportunity to conclude the long-elusive Doha round of trade liberalization launched in 2001. COMMENTARY: ERIK LUETH, SENIOR REGIONAL ECONOMIST, RBS HONG KONG "We need to be realistic and not measure the communique against some utopian benchmark. We don't have a world government and we don't have a global central bank, after all. In this light, the communique is relatively strong. "The guidelines to be agreed upon, while maybe of little immediate consequence, ensure that world leaders keep their eyes on the ball of global imbalances. In essence, everybody agrees that these imbalances are a threat to global financial stability. "Both the U.S. and China got something out of the summit. The U.S. proposal to monitor current accounts was accepted, if in watered-down version. The real winner, though, is China. By shifting the focus from exchange rates to the current account you acknowledge that rebalancing is a gradual process." HIDEKI HAYASHI, GLOBAL ECONOMIST, MIZUHO SECURITIES, TOKYO "Prior to the meeting, one of the things on the U.S. agenda appeared to be a push for further yuan strengthening, while the emerging countries had grievances against further easing by the United States. "The statements suggest consideration was given to both camps. It's clear that a deeper discussion took place compared with G7, but a gap still exists between the interests of developed nations and emerging countries." CALLUM HENDERSON, GLOBAL CURRENCY STRATEGIST, STANDARD CHARTERED BANK, SINGAPORE: "The communique was mildly positive for risk and very much in line with the statement from the finance ministers/central bankers. "It reiterated four key points: 1) the commitment to market-determined exchange rates 2) to avoid competitive devaluations 3) to work toward a framework and guidelines for current account imbalances and 4) to avoid trade protectionism. "The one thing that is different is that it said the headlines say that those EM countries faced with overvalued exchange rates due to capital inflows are fully justified in taking carefully designed macro prudential measures to combat the effects of this. That may cause renewed market concerns of further capital measures to come from as soon as next week, notably in Korea. Meanwhile, Irish debt concerns persist." STEFAN GRABER, COMMODITY ANALYST AT CREDIT SUISSE, SINGAPORE "There is unlikely to be consensus on market-determined exchange rates. But they would probably attract more flows into Asian currencies. In the light of quantitative easing by the Fed, pressure on the dollar is likely to persist in the mid-term and this would tend to be supportive for commodities." TONY PHOO, ECONOMIST, STANDARD CHARTERED, TAIPEI "Member countries are not going to resort to protectionist measures. If we stay clear of protectionist measures, it gives the global economy a chance to recover from recession. There were no specific targets mentioned, no actual numerical goals or so-called hot commitments on how these countries are looking to resolve these issues in terms of managing (forex) rates. That spells difficulty in producing any coordinated policy. It adds greater uncertainty to the markets." QING WANG, CHINA ECONOMIST AT MORGAN STANLEY, HONG KONG: "Developing indicative guidelines is only the start. I cannot see any explicit commitments to setting concrete targets on current account balances. "Capital controls only applied for countries with exchange rates considered as overvalued. It may be a warning to countries with exchange rates considered undervalued not to impose capital controls. It endorses capital controls by countries such as Brazil. That may not be favorable for China, which has been tightening capital controls. JEONG MY-YOUNG, CURRENCY STRATEGIST, SAMSUNG FUTURES, SEOUL "The communique reflects a stance of backing macroprudential steps by the emerging countries. Asian countries, including South Korea, got global justification for capital controls. So the regional authorities may take stronger steps than expected. That will ease upward pressure on Asian currencies overall." ONG YI LING, ANALYST AT PHILLIP FUTURES, SINGAPORE "The G20 meeting is not much of a game changer. What was announced had been expected by the market. Going forward, factors such as euro zone crisis and Irish debt problem will determine moves in the currency market as well as gold." KIERAN DAVIES, CHIEF ECONOMIST, RBS, SYDNEY On the indicative guidelines to spot big current account surpluses: "I think it's very hard because you really are just talking about Asian current account surpluses with the developed world, in particular the U.S.-China trade relationship. I just don't see where they can come up with a magic number that is the threshold, for which if it's below that point it's no problem, and suddenly above that point, it becomes something unsustainable. "In the end, even if you step back from the currency debate, China has just got a strong cost advantage and strong competitive advantage in a lot of these manufactured goods. And it's hard to see that even if you do adjust for the currencies substantially, that the manufacturing sector would suddenly re-emerge in the United States to take up the slack." TIM CONDON, HEAD OF RESEARCH, ING FINANCIAL MARKETS RESEARCH, SINGAPORE: "It is hard to disagree with any of those things. But the hopes before the meeting were a little bit higher that there might be more concrete progress on some of those areas. It is fair to say that it looks like these may have been what they could agree on. They decided just to put down a lot of laudable objectives as the conclusion of the meeting and hope that they can do better, that more can be accomplished in future meetings." MARKET REACTION: - The euro was little changed after the G20 communique. It earlier slipped 0.3 percent against the U.S. dollar to $1.3625 after tumbling 0.9 percent on Thursday on fears that Ireland may need a bailout just like Greece. - European stock futures pared early losses but still pointed to a third straight losing session on renewed concerns about Ireland's debt problems. STOXX Europe 50 futures were down 1.8 percent compared with a drop of more than 2 percent before the G20 news. BACKGROUND: - The G20 had hoped to use the two-day summit to recapture unity forged in the depths of the global financial crisis two years ago soothe exchange rate tensions generated by imbalances between cash-rich exporting nations and debt-burdened importers. But even as U.S. President Barack Obama voiced confidence leaders would find a formula for more balanced and sustainable growth, negotiators squabbled over the wording of the closing statement. - A major irritant in the run-up to the summit has been the Federal Reserve's $600 billion bond-buying spree to revive the U.S. economy, which emerging markets fear will trigger a flood of money into their markets, boosting inflation and asset prices.
