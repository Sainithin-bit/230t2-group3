 DUBLIN  (Reuters) - Irish Prime Minister Brian Cowen said in an interview on Friday that the stance taken by Germany and France on debt restructuring had caused an unintended market reaction. 

 "It hasn't been helpful," he said in an interview with the Irish Independent, referring to German Chancellor Angela Merkel's intervention. "What has been said there has had, I think, an unforeseen consequence, perhaps." (Reporting by  Jodie Ginsberg , Editing by Michael Roddy)
