 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Johnson Controls Inc ( JCI.N ) forecast revenue above Wall Street estimates in its new fiscal year, helped by demand for auto batteries and systems to cut energy use in buildings, especially in emerging markets, and said it would increase capital spending to boost growth. 

 The company said all three of its businesses -- building efficiency, auto interiors and batteries -- would benefit from robust economies in markets like China and the Middle East. All three will show improved profit margins, in part from cost-cutting introduced during the downturn. Johnson Controls, one of the world's biggest auto suppliers, said auto production in the United States was likely to rise moderately next year, would be flat in Europe, and would grow in China at a slightly slower pace. In North America, the biggest issue remains the strength of consumer spending amid high unemployment, Chief Executive Steve Roell said in an interview. He added there is a high correlation between new car sales and home values. "It hasn't stabilized," he said about the U.S. housing market. "It's getting better. I think we're still a ways off and that's why we're still cautious in 2011 relative to the consumer. It's going to take throughout the year for the consumer to build confidence." The company, which is retrofitting New York's Empire State Building to reduce its energy use, forecast revenue of $37 billion for its 2011 fiscal year, now under way. Analysts expected $36.27 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Johnson Controls said it expects earnings of $2.30 to $2.45 a share for the year. Wall Street expects $2.37. Revenue in the automotive interiors segment, which makes car seats, will grow about 5 percent, it said. It forecast a sales gain of 8 percent to 10 percent for the building efficiency segment, and expects 10 percent to 15 percent growth in its battery business, in part because of emerging markets. Shares of Johnson Controls were down 0.5 percent at $31.49 in late trading. MORE CAPITAL SPENDING Johnson Controls forecast 2011 capital investments of $1.2 billion -- a jump of about 60 percent from 2010 -- to increase manufacturing capacity for its batteries and to expand in emerging markets. Last week, the Milwaukee-based company said it would spend $118 million to build a plant in Chongqing, China, for capacity of up to 30 million car batteries a year by 2015. Roell said Johnson Controls would not discuss specific areas where it might make acquisitions. While it is interested in businesses with global capability and strong management, the company -- which gained share in many markets when its competitors failed -- does not buy distressed properties. In recent months, the company has several times "gone to the altar" on deals but walked away at the last minute, Roell told analysts and investors at the New York Stock Exchange. He said the building efficiency segment would get the lion's share of M&A investment in coming years. The company has the capacity to make a $3 billion acquisition, CFO Bruce McDonald said. "There's a lot of opportunity to buy in that sector," said analyst Alex Blanton of Ingalls & Snyder, who does not follow Johnson Controls but covers a rival, Ingersoll-Rand ( IR.N ). Blanton said the building efficiency segment could benefit from greater vertical integration, since right now it sells a lot of components, such as lighting, made by others. "They have to find somebody who wants to sell who is big enough to make a difference," Blanton said. "That's not always easy for a $30 billion company." The 125-year-old company's long-term goals include growing at twice the pace of its markets and increasing net earnings 10 percent to 15 percent a year. Its criteria calls for acquisitions to return 15 percent within four years. BATTERY-POWERED Investments in its battery business are one of the key reasons why the company plans to boost 2011 capital expenditures to $1.2 billion from about $750 million in 2010. Capital spending will stay above $1 billion over the next several years, McDonald said. The company, which makes about 4 million batteries a year in China will more than triple that capacity by 2012 so it no longer has to import batteries into China's booming vehicle market, said group President Alex Molinaroli. "We'd rather export out of China," Molinaroli said. Johnson Controls, which makes about 120 million batteries a year, is also looking to increase capacity for so-called "start-stop" batteries that allow a car engine to shut off instead of idling when a car is stopped, cutting fuel use as much as 12 percent. Global demand for such batteries is seen tripling between 2011 and 2015 to about 20 million units annually. In Europe, start-stop batteries "will almost be ubiquitous for all vehicles by 2015, 2016," Molinaroli said.
