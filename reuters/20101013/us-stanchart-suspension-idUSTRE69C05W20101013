 HONG KONG  (Reuters) - The Hong Kong-listed shares of Standard Chartered Plc ( 2888.HK )( STAN.L ) were suspended on Wednesday after a media report that the emerging market-focused lender plans to raise up to $11 billion in a rights offer. 

 Its shares were suspended pending an announcement relating to a corporate action, the Hong Kong stock exchange said. Trading will resume on Wednesday afternoon. (Reporting by  Denny Thomas ; Editing by Chris Lewis)
