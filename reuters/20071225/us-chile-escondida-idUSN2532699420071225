 SANTIAGO  (Reuters) - Chile's Escondida, the world's largest copper mine, has appealed a government directive requiring it to hire hundreds of non-union workers on a permanent basis, the El Mercurio newspaper reported on Tuesday. 

 The labor directive published earlier this month orders Escondida, majority-owned by the world's largest diversified mining company BHP Billiton ( BHP.AX ), to hire 767 sub-contract workers, which would mean millions of dollars in extra costs. Chile's state-run Codelco, the world's largest copper miner and a state-owned company, also said this month it had appealed recommendations by the Labor Ministry that would force it to hire nearly 5,000 more workers.
