 KOENIGSTEIN, Germany  (Reuters) - Private creditors must contribute to resolving Greece's debt crisis, representatives of major banks in Germany said on Wednesday, while the country's banking association said such a step was likely. 

 "Banks and creditors must participate," said Karl-Georg Altenburg, JP Morgan's senior country officer for Germany, adding that an extension of debt maturities would not suffice on its own but must be part of a broader program. "An extension of maturities and additional money -- that's what it'll come down to," Credit Suisse ( CSGN.VX ) CEO for Central Europe, Michael Ruediger, told a banking conference. That appeared slightly stronger than the line taken by German Banking Association BdB, whose general manager Michael Kemmer said on the sidelines of the meeting: "It is likely that there will be private sector participation. But as a last step. "Other measures need to be exhausted before this happens. There is still some room for maneuver. Kemmer also said the biggest danger in the Greek crisis was the risk of contagion for other periphery countries. Germany earlier put a Greek restructuring back on the table, with Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble demanding in a letter to EU partners that private bondholders make a major contribution to a looming debt relief deal. "An extension of maturities seems to me personally to be the most plausible solution," said Ingrid Hengster, Country Executive Germany at Royal Bank of Scotland "We are all great advocates of the euro zone. It's about calming the discussion." (Reporting by Kathrin Jones and Ed Taylor; writing by  Annika Breidthardt ; Editing by John Stonestreet)
