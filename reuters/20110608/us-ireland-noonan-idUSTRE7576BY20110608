 DUBLIN  (Reuters) - Any private-sector contribution to a new bailout for Greece would not likely affect Ireland's planned return to bond markets next year, Finance Minister Michael Noonan said on Wednesday. 

 The euro zone edged closer on Wednesday to a compromise on a second Greek bailout package under which private creditors would be asked to swap their sovereign debt holdings for bonds with longer maturities. While German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble demanded a "quantified and substantial" contribution from bondholders as part of any new Greek deal, Noonan said he did not think this would have a big impact on Ireland. "I don't think it would have any particular implication for Ireland, but of course we are conscious of what is happening in Greece," he told reporters when asked if it would affect Ireland's return to markets. "We think that the full (Greek) package will be made clear at the ECOFIN meeting on June 20. Before that date there is a lot of speculation, (but) from the contacts I had today in Brussels, there is no resolution yet." Ireland's battle to get a reduction in the interest rate Europe is charging on its portion of an 85 billion euro rescue package has intensified in recent days with local media reporting that France could use its veto powers to prevent Ireland getting a cut. Noonan said Ireland remained committed to getting an interest rate reduction and reiterated that it would not bow to demands, particularly from France, to raise its low corporate tax rate in return. "We have convinced the European Commission, the IMF and the OECD that we should get it. We have also convinced 24, 25 of our colleague countries but the French and the Germans are opposing it," Noonan said. "What I am saying clearly to the French negotiators who are pressing us on the corporate rate is look, there ain't no circumstances at which we're either going to alter the base or the rate." "There are literally hundreds of conditions in the memorandum of understanding ... We are prepared to concede elsewhere in the program if they identify an area that would be valuable to the program." While Noonan noted that Greece had to commit to "very significant" additional privatization in return for a reduction in the interest rates on its loans, Ireland had not been put under pressure to speed up its plans but that that could change. "It could happen ... Certainly privatization seems to be a factor now in the program countries (Ireland, Portugal and Greece) and seems to be policy across the euro zone."
