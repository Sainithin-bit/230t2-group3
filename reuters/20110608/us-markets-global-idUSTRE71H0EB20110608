 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. and European stocks fell for a sixth straight day on Wednesday on worries about a bleak global economic outlook, while oil prices jumped after OPEC failed to reach an agreement to increase output. 

 The U.S. dollar hit a one-month low below 80 yen as risk aversion rose, but it rallied against the euro after weaker-than-expected German economic data and on uncertainty surrounding the resolution of Greece's debt crisis. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke on Tuesday acknowledged that the U.S. economy had slowed but offered no hint that the central bank is considering further stimulus to support growth. Bernanke's comments, combined with recent weak U.S. labor and manufacturing data, helped push benchmark Treasury yields below the key 3 percent level and stoked fears that a slowdown in the world's largest economy could dent global growth. "Investors are re-pricing the slowdown after Bernanke crystallized it," said Jason L. Ware, senior equity research and trading analyst at Albion Financial Group in Salt Lake City. "The market was hoping for an indication that there may be another round of stimulus but clearly, that's not what they got." World stocks as measured by the MSCI world equity index .MIWD00000PUS slipped 0.8 percent. The Thomson Reuters global stock index  .TRXFLDGLPU  also lost 0.8 percent. Emerging market stocks .MSCIEF dropped 0.7 percent. The FTSEurofirst 300  .FTEU3  index of top European shares closed down 0.9 percent at 1094.33 for the sixth day of losses. It marked the lowest close in nearly three months. U.S. stocks also extended losses for the sixth straight session. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  ended down 21.87 points, or 0.18 percent, at 12,048.94. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  was down 5.38 points, or 0.42 percent, at 1,279.56. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  was down 26.18 points, or 0.97 percent, at 2,675.38. Brent crude oil rose $1.07, or 1 percent, to settle at $117.85 a barrel. U.S. crude gained $1.65, or 1.67 percent, to settle at $100.74 a barrel. OPEC talks broke down without an agreement to raise output after Saudi Arabia failed to convince other members to lift production. The news raised fears of supply shortages later this year and a price rally that could further limit any global economic recovery. "It came as a surprise. It is bullish for prices. If you look at demand it will be very robust in the next months and there is a big need for extra OPEC oil," said Amrita Sen from Barclays Capital. Spot gold fell 0.5 percent to $1,534.64 an ounce, against $1,542.85 late on Tuesday in New York. EURO DOWN AHEAD OF ECB The dollar was last down 0.2 percent at 79.90 yen after hitting as low as 79.67 yen, according to Reuters data. Traders said losses accelerated after automatic sell orders were triggered on the greenback's drop below 80 yen. The euro fell 0.8 percent against the dollar to $1.4570 and was down 1 percent at 116.41 yen after German exports posted their biggest drop in more than two years in April and industry output fell 0.6 percent. Uncertainty over Greece's debt crisis also dented demand for the euro. A report by the European Union, European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund obtained by Reuters indicated that the next disbursement of Greek aid could not take place until after it corrected under-financing in the country's adjustment program. Greece sealed a 110 billion euro aid deal a year ago but has failed to restore confidence in its finances. German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said Athens needs an additional 90 billion euros in a second package that will get the country through 2014. Despite debt worries, analysts still expect the European Central Bank to raise interest rates again this year to counter inflation. ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet is expected to hint at a July rate hike after Thursday's policy meeting. A warning from Fitch Ratings that the United States probably would not be able to maintain its prized AAA sovereign ratings status if it suffered even a "technical" default on its debt had little impact on the dollar and Treasury prices. Yields on 10-year notes were at 2.95 percent, down from 3.00 percent late on Tuesday. The yield on 10-year U.S. paper was about 9 basis points below that of 10-year German Bunds, the widest spread in a month. "Ironically, Treasuries could rally" if global markets are shaken up by a U.S. default, said Steve Van Order, fixed income strategist with Calvert Investment Management Inc. "Look what happened in 2008: we were the source of that whole financial crisis and yet the dollar went up and Treasury yields fell."
