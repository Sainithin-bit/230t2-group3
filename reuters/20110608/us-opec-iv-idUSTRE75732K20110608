 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - OPEC talks broke down on Wednesday without reaching an agreement to hike output after Saudi Arabia failed to convince members to lift production to help consumer nations struggling with high fuel costs. 

 Secretary General Abdullah El-Badri said the effective decision was no change in policy and that OPEC hoped to meet again in three months time to assess the situation. Saudi Arabia and other Gulf producers had been seeking to push through an increase to help the economies of consumer nations, but price hawks such as Iran, Venezuela and Algeria refused to consider a hike. Oil prices, jumped more then $2 a barrel, pushing U.S. crude above $100 a barrel, after the news. Following are comments from analysts, brokers and traders: CHRISTOPHE BARRET OIL ANALYSTS AT CREDIT AGRICOLE "It is a surprise and it seems clear that Saudi Arabia wants to increase oil output, while the organization could not agree. What will emerge is that the Saudis, being the only ones who can rapidly increase production, will say they are going to go ahead and supply their clients with the extra product they need regardless. I don't think this outcome is that bullish for the market. Right now they are producing 9.5 million barrels per day, having increased production on the month by 500,000 bpd. They can increase output relatively fast to supply the market with what it needs and I think that could correspond to an extra 1.1 million bpd in the next quarter, and by a further 1.1 million bpd in the final quarter of the year." PHIL FLYNN, ENERGY ANALYST, PFGBEST RESEARCH, CHICAGO "The market rallied on the report that OPEC couldn't come to an agreement on production quota. It was sold off in anticipation of a hike and this rise will take that out. "This is more of a political statement than anything that will have a lasting impact on production, despite the fact that the prices are rising. "I think Iran, Venezuela and Algeria stuck want to show they matter. They are basically telling Saudi Arabia 'we're not happy with your action in Bahrain.' These countries were producing as much oil as they can anyway and couldn't have increased output. "The cartel has not been sticking to quotas and this will damage OPEC's credibility down the road." KATHERINE SPECTOR, COMMODITY STRATEGIST, CANADIAN IMPERIAL BANK OF COMMERCE, NEW YORK "They can't even coordinate their statements to the press. The Saudis must be angry. This decision was not relevant to physical output anyway -- it was symbolic. I suppose the Venezuelans and Iranians are already producing as much as they can; the only way they get extra revenue is from a higher price. And they aren't going to get any gold stars from the U.S. or Western powers that be anyway. The Saudis would have liked the gold star for political good behavior." SAMUEL CISZUK ANALYST AT IHS GLOBAL INSIGHT IN LONDON "It is not a big surprise, no. "What is a bit of a surprise is the open way in which they say it is no agreement. Normally they project unity and we expected them to say 'no change', but they will evaluate the market over the summer or hold an extraordinary meeting. "One factor is a diverging market view. Another is politics. At times of heated politics/ideological debate, Saudi struggled to dominate as much as it could have given its size vis-a-vis others in OPEC. Radicals -- in the political sense -- could push Saudi ahead of themselves to some extent and punch above their weight, although only to a certain degree. Gaddafi in the 70s is a good example, Venezuela in the early 70s another. "The Saudis have options though; raising production "to fill in for Libya" or calling a new meeting soon if prices start going up decisively again. Still, they will be annoyed, I imagine. It could be a bit of a wake-up call that they need to up their diplomacy to sway some key states their way." AMRITA SEN, ANALYST AT BARCAP "It came as a surprise. It is bullish for prices. If you look at demand it will be very robust in the next months and there is a big need for extra OPEC oil. "So one could say that the only way to balance the market now is through the release of stocks. "On the other hand some people might say that OPEC's decision does not matter because they have been already overproducing and will be overproducing more. "It will be important to see if the Saudis are willing to supply more, it will matter a lot. Otherwise the market will be very tight." CHRIS DILLMAN, ANALYST, TRADITION ENERGY, STAMFORD, CONNECTICUT "OPEC left without a decision and it sounds like output is unchanged. Crude had been pressured on the expectation that they would boost production, so after this decision it is going to be pushed up to where it was before. "I do not think it is a surprise, but it is a supportive factor and I think this will get us back up to $100 and pivot around there until something else happens." CARL LARRY, DIRECTOR OF ENERGY DERIVATIVES AND RESEARCH, BLUE OCEAN BROKERAGE, NEW YORK, NY "I think the non-agreement is getting a bit of overreaction in the market. All this is doing is opening the door for Saudis to do what everyone else is doing: cheating. What I do think is pretty bullish about this is that we are seeing more lines drawn between the Arab states and that could exacerbate the issues there already." TOM BENTZ, DIRECTOR, BNP PARIBAS COMMODITY FUTURES, INC, NEW YORK, NY "It seems to me that with crude prices as high as they are, most members are already producing as much as they possibly can. Legitimizing the output quotas would have been a non-event anyway. The only question was will members allow producers with additional capacity to add more supply to the market. "The consensus is no, but that doesn't mean as the Saudis have said before, they were ready to act with OPEC. They may still add 500,000 barrels to the market. But in the big picture, none of this matters since we are not replacing the 1.6 million barrels of Libyan crude the market lost a few months ago."
