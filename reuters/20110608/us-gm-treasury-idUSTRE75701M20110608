 (Reuters) - The Treasury Department is unwilling to sell a piece of its stake in General Motors back to the automaker while the shares are trading at 13 percent less than the initial public offering, Bloomberg reported citing a person familiar with the matter. 

 GM's executives have also discussed buying part of the Treasury's shares or allowing common-stock holders to sell back shares, Bloomberg said. The government, which owns a 32 percent stake in the Detroit-based company, is looking to get at least the $33 the IPO was priced at, if not more, Bloomberg said citing the same source. Spokespersons for General Motors and the Treasury were not available for comment outside business hours. (Reporting by  Abhiram Nandakumar  in Bangalore; Editing by  Lisa Shumaker )
