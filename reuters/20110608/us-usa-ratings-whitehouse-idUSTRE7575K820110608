 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The White House said on Wednesday the warning from Fitch Ratings that the U.S. triple-A debt rating was in peril if it suffered even a "technical" debt default showed the need to raise the U.S. borrowing limit. 

 "It makes clear the case that we've been making, that there is no alternative here to raising the debt ceiling. This is not about additional spending, this is about honoring about the obligations the United States government has made," White House press secretary Jay Carney told a daily briefing.
