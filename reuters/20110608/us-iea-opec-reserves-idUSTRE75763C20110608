 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - If Saudi Arabia can't fill the "gap" in oil supply needed to meet world demand, then the International Energy Agency would coordinate a release of its member countries' emergency petroleum reserves, the head of the IEA said on Wednesday. 

 "We are ready to move," IEA Executive Director Nobuo Tanaka said at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank. (Reporting by  Tom Doggett )
