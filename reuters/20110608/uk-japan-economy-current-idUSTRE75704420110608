 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japan's current account surplus tumbled in April from the same period a year earlier as exports and industrial output slumped after a devastating earthquake in March, but the surplus is likely to stabilise and start expanding in coming months as manufacturers restore output and exports. 

 KEY POINTS: -- Japan's current account surplus fell 69.5 percent in April from a year earlier, Ministry of Finance data showed on Wednesday, more than a 34.3 percent decline in the year to March but less than the median forecast for an 84.3 percent annual drop. -- The surplus stood at 405.6 billion yen ($5.07 billion), versus the median forecast for a 210 billion yen surplus. -- Outstanding loans held by Japanese banks fell 0.7 percent in May from a year earlier, down for the 18th straight month but at a slower pace, the Bank of Japan said on Wednesday, after the March earthquake and tsunami lifted some corporations' demand for funding. COMMENTARY: GEORGE WORTHINGTON, CHIEF ECONOMIST, ASIA-PACIFIC, IFR MARKETS, SYDNEY "Japan's latest run of data came out near expectations, which is to say, quite weak. "There is no sign of a pickup (in bank lending) in the wake of the earthquake and the report highlights that the main transmission mechanism for monetary policy remains broken. "In seasonally-adjusted terms, the (current account) surplus hit a 27-month low. The data shows the economy continues to falter, exacerbated by the disasters." JUNKO NISHIOKA, CHIEF ECONOMIST JAPAN, RBS SECURITIES, TOKYO "We cannot rule out the possibility that the trade deficit may widen in the coming months on demand for LNG and crude oil to make up for the nuclear energy loss. But the current account balance is unlikely to swing to a deficit given the country's steady income surplus. "The current account surplus is expected to start picking up from later this year as the trade balance will return to a surplus in the July-September quarter. Still surpluses are unlikely to return to such high levels as those seen in 2007-2008 because the recovery in global demand will be sluggish." TAKESHI MINAMI, CHIEF ECONOMIST, NORINCHUKIN RESEARCH INSTITUTE, TOKYO "The current account surplus will continue to shrink as a trend until around the autumn. But production is recovering faster than initially expected and while there are signs of a global economic slowdown, Japanese exports will bounce back. If so, the surplus will increase again later this year. "A slowdown in the global economy cannot be ruled out. If so, it might be difficult for exports to return to levels immediately before the quake because Japan's economy is still very much reliant on exports." SHUJI TONOUCHI, SENIOR FIXED-INCOME STRATEGIST, MITSUBISHI UFJ MORGAN STANLEY SECURITIES, TOKYO "The trade balance swung to a deficit, which pulled down the current account surplus. "However, the income surplus is strong due to income from investments in overseas assets. "We can expect a recovery in production at Japanese manufacturers from here on, so the current account surplus isn't likely to worsen further. "There are still risks to the outlook, such as signs of a slowdown in overseas economies. This is something that the Bank of Japan is likely to watch closely, but for the time being the BOJ will keep monetary policy on hold as it wants to confirm how quickly Japanese production will recover." BACKGROUND: -- Japan is facing its worst crisis since World War Two after a 9.0 magnitude earthquake and a tsunami slammed its northeast coast on March 11, triggering meltdowns at a nuclear power plant. -- Shortages of electricity could disrupt some manufacturing activity in the summer, but companies have been making progress in restoring lost production and mending supply chains of parts needed to make goods. -- Japan's gross domestic product probably shrank an annualised 3.0 percent in the first quarter, less than a preliminary estimate of a 3.7 percent annualised decline, as inventories and corporate spending fell less than initially reported, according to a Reuters poll. The revised data is due at 8:50 a.m. on June 9 (2350 GMT on June 8). -- Analysts expect the economy to shrink again in April-June, which would mark three consecutive quarters of decline, and then resume growing in the second half of the year as exports recover.
