 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia faces opposition from some in OPEC for an output ceiling rise it wants the group to approve at its Wednesday meeting in Vienna. 

 OPEC's official output ceiling, in place since December 2008, stands at 24.84 million barrels per day. Actual output from the 11 group members with production targets was at 26.23 million bpd in May, according to a Reuters survey. FOR AN INCREASE * SAUDI ARABIA - Oil Minister Ali al-Naimi has not spoken ahead of the meeting. A senior Gulf industry source told Reuters the kingdom plans a unilateral output increase of around 500,000 bpd in June. * KUWAIT - "There is a need for more supply in the market," Oil Minister Mohammad al-Busairi told Reuters. "I expect demand to be strong in the third and fourth quarter, the demand will mainly come from Asia." "I expect OPEC to increase output during this meeting but I am still unsure how much." * UAE - "We have to look beyond the second quarter, the market will be tight," Oil Minister Mohammed bin Dhaen al-Hamli said. * NIGERIA - Represented at the meeting by OPEC governor Goni Musa Sheikh, who has not been drawn on the issue. He attended the Tuesday meeting of OPEC's Ministerial Monitoring Committee (MMC) which an OPEC delegate said recommended a one million bpd rise. * ALGERIA - Oil Minister Youcef Yousfi also has not spoken on a raise but also attended the MMC meeting. AGAINST AN INCREASE * VENEZUELA - President Hugo Chavez said on Tuesday he opposed more OPEC oil: "We do not agree with production being increased now...we must continue to defend fair prices." * ECUADOR - President Rafael Correa, speaking beside Chavez, said production should only increase when demand grows. * IRAN - Its OPEC governor Mohammad Khatibi has said there is no need to raise. * IRAQ - No direct statement but Oil Minister Abdul-Kareem Luaibi said oil prices were not too high. Iraq is not subject to OPEC output targets. UNKNOWN * QATAR - Energy Minister Mohammed Saleh al-Sada yet to speak in Vienna but the group's second smallest oil producer usually backs the views of its Gulf neighbors. * ANGOLA - Angola's oil minister said he did not expect a raise but added he would not oppose one if it were needed. * LIBYA - Represented by a stand-in, Omran Abukraa, after the defection its top oil official.
