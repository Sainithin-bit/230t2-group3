 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Independent power producer Dynegy Inc. ( DYN.N ) on Wednesday posted a third-quarter net loss as charges related to a write-down of a Kentucky power plant cut into gains in its Midwest operations. 

 The company, which will spend more than $2 billion to buy power plants from private equity fund LS Power Group, said the net loss applicable to common stockholders was $69 million, or 14 cents per share, compared with a year-earlier profit of $23 million, or 6 cents per share. Excluding special charges, Dynegy, which provides power to the Midwest, Northeast and South, earned 6 cents per share, falling short of analysts' average forecast of 10 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue fell 24.5 percent to $581 million from $770 million. With the purchase of the LS Power plants, Dynegy's generating capacity will jump to 20,000 megawatts from nearly 13,000 MW currently. Daniele Seitz, an analyst at Dahlman Rose & Co, said the quarter was weaker than expected because "power prices crashed pretty quickly toward the end of the quarter." But the company benefited from improved margins and lower interest costs, said Seitz, who has a "buy" rating on Dynegy. Average market prices for power declined nearly 30 percent from the year-earlier period, President Steve Furbacher told a conference call. The company's net volume, or the sales volume of generated power, fell 20 percent, pushed down by planned production outages and reduced operations. These were somewhat offset by stronger realized prices in the Midwest due to existing contracts and by benefits from unrealized gains in its hedge portfolio. Shares of Dynegy were down 21 cents, or 3.4 percent, to $6.01 in early morning trading in the New York Stock Exchange. CHARGES WEIGH The Houston-based company said current results included $98 million in special after-tax charges. These items included a $61 million write-down of the value of its Bluegrass peaking plant and a $23 million charge related to a debt exchange. The Houston company also took a $14 million charge as part of a $44 million payment to Enron Corp. to settle outstanding claims dating back to 2001 with the now-defunct power trader. Dynegy, which backed out of a planned purchase of Enron in the weeks before Enron's collapse into bankruptcy, underwent a management change and restructuring that enabled it to avoid financial ruin in the wake of the power markets collapse of 2001-2002. Dynegy cut the forecast for 2006 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for its power generation business to between $475 million and $505 million from $570 million to $630 million. That would bring its expected net loss applicable to common shareholders to $305 million to $325 million versus the previous forecast of a loss of $215 million to $260 million.
