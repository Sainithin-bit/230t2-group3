 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - ExpressJet Holdings Inc. XJT.N, which flies regional jets for Continental Airlines CAL.N, posted a lower-than-expected profit on Wednesday, hurt by higher expenses and sending its shares down nearly 9 percent. 

 The feeder airline reported a lower operating margin, as it incurred costs related to diversification, back-office infrastructure and headquarters relocation. These higher expenses were not expected, said Jim Corridore, an equity analyst at Standard & Poor's. Net profit in the third quarter fell 11 percent to $22.7 million, or 38 cents per share, from $25.5 million, or 43 cents per share, a year earlier. Wall Street analysts, on average, were expecting 42 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. ExpressJet's shares were off 68 cents at $7.55 during morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Its shares have traded in a 52-week range of $10.97 to $5.01. Last month, ExpressJet said it will launch a new unit to charter planes to businesses and other private entities. Last May, ExpressJet said it would hold on to 69 regional jets after Continental canceled a capacity purchase agreement agreement. That decision left the company searching for new business ventures for the planes. ExpressJet said it would add five of those freed up aircraft to its Corporate Aviation business, bringing the fleet in that unit up to 15. Operating revenue rose 8.8 percent to $428.6 million, helped by fuller planes. Load factor, the measure of how full flights are, rose 1.5 points to 78.1 percent. Operating margin fell to 8.1 percent from 9.6 percent. The company rebated $2.6 million back to Continental to meet its contractual operating margin of 10 percent.
