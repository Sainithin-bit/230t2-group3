  LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Leading network equipment maker Cisco Systems Inc. ( CSCO.O ) reported a rise in fiscal first-quarter profit on Wednesday as businesses upgraded their networks to handle increasing Internet traffic. 

  COMMENTARY: ERIK SUPPIGER, ANALYST, PACIFIC GROWTH EQUITIES: "It's a very impressive quarter. I think there was certainly some expectation for upside and they delivered considerable upside..." "There's certainly some room to run (for the stock). I would not be surprised to see it run into the high $20s. They're demonstrating some pretty strong revenue growth. The earnings multiple in the high teens or 20s is not unrealistic." Re: drivers for growth in 2007: "I think it would be service providers broadly, which includes Scientific-Atlanta. More than Scientific-Atlanta, I think the deployment IPTV and next-generation carrier networks is going to be a pretty strong market opportunity for Cisco." MARK SUE, ANALYST, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS: "Revenues were better than most people were expecting ... the EPS was also 2 cents better, and in terms of the metrics I think the gross margins are very healthy for Cisco, indicating they are still able to charge a premium for their products... "The driver (in 2007) for Cisco is video. For their enterprise customers it is a big driver and also emerging markets... "In terms of consolidation, we have seen some (negative impact) but so far Cisco is a little better shielded than some of its peers."
