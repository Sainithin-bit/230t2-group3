 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Barr Pharmaceuticals Inc. BRL.N said on Wednesday that quarterly earnings fell 37 percent, hurt by charges related to its acquisition of Pliva and a patent settlement. 

 Net income at the Woodcliff Lake, New Jersey-based company fell to $52.8 million, or 49 cents per share, from $83.2 million, or 78 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, the company earned 78 cents per share. Revenue rose 7 percent to $322 million. Barr is changing its fiscal year, which had ended in June, to a regular calendar year, and said it would provide its forecast for 2007 results in February. Generic product sales fell 5 percent to $198 million. That decline was offset by a 73 percent jump in sales for its proprietary products to $103 million, led by several birth-control products. Barr last month finalized its deal to acquire Croatian drugmaker Pliva, making the combined company the world's third-largest generic drug manufacturer. Barr took a pretax charge of 25 cents per share tied to the decline in fair value of the company's foreign currency option acquired in connection with the Pliva deal. It also recorded a one-time charge of 4 cents per share for a payment to a third-party supplier arising from a patent-challenge settlement.
