 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - McDonald's Corp. ( MCD.N ) on Wednesday said sales at its hamburger restaurants open at least 13 months rose 5.5 percent in October, helped by a popular Monopoly promotion in the United States. 

 Three Wall Street analysts had forecast increases of 4.6 percent to 5.5 percent. The stock edged up less than 1 percent. In the United States, McDonald's primary market, same-store sales rose 5.6 percent, driven by the Monopoly game and a strong breakfast business. "Domestic results were excellent once again with comparable sales ... 1-2 percentage points above our expectations," A.G. Edwards analyst Jack Russo wrote in a note to clients. "Lower gas prices have helped all restaurant chains of late, but these figures are also strong due to McDonald's continued emphasis on improved food and menu," he said. McDonald's and other restaurant chains struggled over the summer, when steep gasoline prices prompted some people to cut back on driving trips. Russo said McDonald's appeared to be taking market share from rivals Burger King Holdings Inc. BKC.N and Yum Brands Inc. ( YUM.N ), owner of Taco Bell, KFC and Pizza Hut, which is expected to release its monthly sales later this week. In Europe, McDonald's same-store sales were up 5.5 percent, with particular strength in Germany and France. Systemwide sales rose 8.2 percent. Stripping out the effect of foreign currency, sales were up 6.6 percent, the Oak Brook, Illinois-based company said. McDonald's shares were up 27 cents, or 0.7 percent, at $41.93 in afternoon New York Stock Exchange trade. The stock trades at about 16.3 times analysts' profit forecasts for next year, compared with multiples of 14.8 for Burger King and 18.6 for Yum Brands.
