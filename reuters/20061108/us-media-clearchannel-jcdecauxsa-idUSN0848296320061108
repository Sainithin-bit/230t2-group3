 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - France's JCDecaux SA ( JCDX.PA ) said it would like to buy its larger rival, Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings Inc. ( CCO.N ), the company's co-CEO said in an interview with the Wall Street Journal. 

 A deal would combine the world's two biggest outdoor advertising companies. Clear Channel Outdoor, the majority-owned unit of Clear Channel Communications Inc. ( CCU.N ) has a market value of $8.9 billion. Private equity groups Providence Equity Partners, Blackstone and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. are in advanced talks to buy Clear Channel Communications, the largest U.S. radio company. A deal could put the outdoor business in play, as the winner would use the sale to pay down debt. Paris-based JCDecaux has expressed its interest in recent conversations with at least two of the private-equity teams, the Journal reported, citing a person familiar with the matter. "Combining Clear Channel Outdoor and JCDecaux would create one of the few global media companies in the world with a lot of potential growth," said Jean-Francois Decaux, JCDecaux co-chief executive, in the Journal interview. "Of course, we're interested."
