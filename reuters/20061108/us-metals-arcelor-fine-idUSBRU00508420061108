 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - The European Commission fined three units of steel maker Arcelor CELR.PA a total of 10 million euros ($12.8 million) on Wednesday for participating in a steel beams price-fixing cartel from 1988 to 1991. 

 The Commission's decision is a re-adoption of its own ruling from 1994, which was thrown out on procedural grounds by the European Court of Justice in 2003. The court scrapped the Commission's initial fine because the European Union executive had not sent a statement of objections to the interested company, at that time called Arbed SA, in 1992. Arbed has since changed its name to Arcelor Luxembourg SA. "The Commission decided to re-open the procedure as regards Arbed SA and issued a statement of objections on 8 March 2006 correcting the procedural error," it said in a statement. The other two units of Arcelor included in the fine are Arcelor International SA, formerly TradeArbed SA, and a wholly owned subsidiary of Arbed, and Arcelor Profil Luxembourg SA, formerly ProfilArbed SA. "Between 1988 and 1991, the companies fixed prices, allocated quotas and exchanged confidential information in the steel beams industry covering the whole of the single market," the Commission said. In determining the size of the fine, the Commission took into account the size of the European Community market for the product in 1990, the last complete year of the infringement, the duration of the cartel and the size of the firms involved. "Under normal circumstances the fine would have been at least 20 million euros, plus an increase for the duration," it said. "However, by way of exceptional circumstances, the Commission considers that it has already taken a position on the amount of the fine for Arbed SA in its 1994 decision, which the Court of First Instance reduced to 10 million euros. The total fine imposed in this case is therefore 10 million euros."
