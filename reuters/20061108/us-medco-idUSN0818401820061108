 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Medco Health Solutions Inc. MHS.N tried to strike a merger deal with Caremark Rx Inc. CMX.N in the days before the rival pharmacy-benefits manager accepted a $21 billion bid from drug chain CVS Corp. ( CVS.N ), The Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday. 

 Caremark feared a combination of the two largest U.S. drug managers would not get antitrust approval, the paper said. That and other factors led to talks breaking down. Medco's move suggests it could pursue a new Caremark deal or a different acquisition. Wall Street chatter on Tuesday was that Franklin Lakes, New Jersey-based Medco or another buyer would try to disrupt the Caremark-CVS combination, the Journal said. Investors have reacted coolly to the Caremark-CVS deal, which was announced on November 1.
