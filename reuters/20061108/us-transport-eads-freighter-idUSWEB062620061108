 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - EADS ( EAD.PA ) finance chief Hans Peter Ring said on Wednesday UPS's ( UPS.N ) and International Lease Finance Corporation's (ILFC) orders for the A380 freighter version had to be confirmed after FedEx ( FDX ) canceled its order for 10 of the aircraft. 

 He said, depending on the customers' decision, development of the A380 freighter version would continue. But he added: "We will have to take another decision whenever the customer's made up their mind finally." He also said demand was currently higher than expected for the Airbus A330 and that the Power8 cost-cutting program was "crucial" for the funding needs of the planned A350 XWB.
