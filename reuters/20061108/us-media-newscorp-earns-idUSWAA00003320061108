 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - News Corp. NWSa.N reported on Wednesday a quarterly profit mainly due to increased advertising sales at its U.S. television networks and gains from asset sales, offsetting weaker DVD revenue. 

 The owner of the 20th Century Fox movie studio and Internet social network MySpace said its fiscal first-quarter profit was $843 million, or 27 cents per share, compared to a net loss of $433 million, or 13 cents a share a year earlier. News Corp. took a non cash charge of $1 billion to reduce the value of its television stations federal licenses in the year earlier period. Revenue rose 4 percent to $5.9 billion. Wall Street expected the company to post a profit of 21 cents per share and revenue of $5.9 billion. Operating income fell 6 percent to $851 million, from $909 million a year earlier, dragged by lower revenue at its movies division. Film division operating income fell 35 percent to $239 million from $368 million as the year earlier quarter included strong revenue from syndication fees for Fox TV shows and DVD sales from "Robots" and "Hide and Seek". Its television division operating income rose 20 percent to $192 million primarily from its U.S. advertising sales at its Fox TV network. Its cable network operating profit rose 26 percent to $249 million mainly on an advertising sales gain from its Fox News network and regional sports networks. News Corp., which announced a MySpace joint venture with Japan's Softbank Corp. ( 9984.T ) on Tuesday, sees its Internet division as the company's fastest area of growth, has said it plans to launch into 11 international regions including China. It does not currently break out the financial performance of its Internet businesses. Shares of the media conglomerate have outpaced its rivals since the beginning of the year. Most big media stocks have rallied this year on the belief that the Internet will be a profit growth opportunity for years to come, but News Corp. has led the pack. Its enterprise value currently trades at 13-times its fiscal 2007 earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, compared to Walt Disney Co.'s ( DIS.N ) 2007 EV/EBITDA of 10 and Time Warner Inc.'s ( TWX.N ) 9-times valuation.
