 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Network equipment maker Cisco Systems Inc. ( CSCO.O ) forecast on Wednesday year-on-year revenue growth of 24 percent to 25 percent in its fiscal second quarter. 

 Cisco President and CEO John Chambers also told analysts in an earnings call that the company's stand-alone revenue, which excludes that of cable set-top box maker Scientific Atlanta, would likely rise 14 percent to 15 percent in the fiscal second quarter. Cisco earlier reported results for its fiscal first quarter, which showed higher-than-expected growth in revenue and earnings.
