 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A federal judge on Wednesday approved a $336 million settlement of a lawsuit accusing banks and credit card groups of conspiring to charge excessive fees on transactions denominated in foreign currencies. 

 The plaintiffs said Visa, MasterCard Inc. ( MA.N ) and others colluded to fix amounts charged to convert transactions from one currency to another, and failed to properly disclose costs. Other defendants included Bank of America Corp. ( BAC.N ), Citigroup Inc. ( C.N ), HSBC Holdings Plc ( HSBA.L ), JPMorgan Chase & Co ( JPM.N ), Washington Mutual Inc. ( WM.N ) and various affiliates. The settlement "appears to be the product of serious, informed, non-collusive negotiations by experienced counsel," wrote Judge William Pauley of the U.S. District Court in Manhattan. "The settlement amount falls within a reasonable range for purposes of preliminary approval." Calls to both sides seeking comment were not immediately returned.
