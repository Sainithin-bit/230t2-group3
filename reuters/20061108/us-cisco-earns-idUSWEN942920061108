 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Cisco Systems Inc. ( CSCO.O ) reported a higher-than-expected rise in quarterly profit on Wednesday on orders from businesses upgrading to handle increasing Internet traffic, lifting its shares by 6 percent. 

 The results from the leading network equipment maker also showed substantial gains from its February acquisition of cable set-top box maker Scientific Atlanta, validating its expansion from its main business of making routers and switches to direct Web traffic. Cisco said profit before special items rose to $1.9 billion, or 31 cents per share, in its fiscal first quarter, from $1.6 billion, or 25 cents per share, a year ago. The result beat the average Wall Street forecast of 29 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. "It's a very impressive quarter. I think there was certainly some expectation for upside and they delivered considerable upside," said Erik Suppiger, an analyst at Pacific Growth Securities. Cisco Chief Executive John Chambers told analysts on a conference call that he expected fiscal second-quarter revenue to rise 24 percent to 25 percent from a year ago, or to rise 14 percent to 15 percent excluding Scientific Atlanta. Analysts said one of the drivers of growth is Cisco's video business, which is gaining steam alongside rising consumer demand for Web-based television services, known as Internet Protocol television (IPTV). "More than Scientific-Atlanta, I think the deployment of IPTV and next-generation carrier networks is going to be a pretty strong market opportunity for Cisco," Suppiger said. Cisco said net profit for the quarter ended October 28 rose to $1.6 billion, or 26 cents per share, from $1.3 billion, or 20 cents per share, in the same quarter a year earlier. Revenue rose 25 percent to $8.2 billion, with Scientific Atlanta, which was not part of Cisco last year, contributing $584 million. Analysts on average had expected revenue of $7.9 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. Cisco also said it had repurchased 66 million shares of common stock at an average price of $22.85 for an aggregate purchase price of $1.5 billion during the quarter. Having closed at $25.10 on Nasdaq, Cisco shares rose to $26.65 in after-hours trade on the results, a level not seen since 2004. "Revenues were better than most people were expecting," said Mark Sue, analyst at RBC Capital Markets. "The EPS was also 2 cents better, and in terms of the metrics I think the gross margins are very healthy for Cisco, indicating they are still able to charge a premium for their products." The stock has risen about 47 percent since the start of the year, compared to a 6 percent rise in the Nasdaq 100 and a 16 percent fall in rival equipment maker Juniper Networks Inc. JNPR.O.
