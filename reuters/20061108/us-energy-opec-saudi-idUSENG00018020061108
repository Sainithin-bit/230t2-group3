 ABU DHABI  (Reuters) - All OPEC ministers have sincerely pledged to carry out output cuts of 1.2 million barrels per day, an OPEC delegate said on Wednesday, dismissing a U.S. government agency report that reductions would fall far short. 

 The U.S. Energy Administration said on Tuesday it expected OPEC to reduce its oil production levels in November by just 745,000 barrels per day.
