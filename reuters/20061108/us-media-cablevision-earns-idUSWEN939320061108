 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Cablevision Systems Corp. ( CVC.N ) said on Wednesday it posted a narrower quarterly loss as subscribers continued to grow for its cable television, telephone and high-speed Internet services. 

 The company, which is assessing a bid by its controlling shareholder, the Dolan family, to take it private, said it continues to benefit from success in offering attractively priced bundles of services for consumers in the New York area. "While the Cablevision bundle continues to drive results, we believe performance metrics are now relatively in-line with expectations as the company is on track to achieve full-year guidance," UBS analyst Aryeh Bourkoff said in a note on Wednesday. Cablevision re-affirmed its forecast for basic video subscriber growth of 3.5 percent to 4.0 percent in 2006, and total revenue growth in the high teens percentage. It also said it sees capital expenditure of $750 million. Its net loss slimmed to $59.2 million, or 21 cents a share, in the third quarter from $62.9 million, or 22 cents a share, a year ago. Revenue rose to $1.41 billion from $1.24 billion. Analysts, on average, expected the company, which also owns the Madison Square Garden arena in New York and cable TV networks AMC, IFC and WE, to post a loss of $38 million, or 13 cents per share, on revenue of $1.41 billion. Cablevision, which serves 3 million households in the New York metropolitan area, said average monthly revenue per basic video customer rose to $111.13 from $96.69 a year ago. The Bethpage, New York-based company said basic video subscribers were up for the tenth consecutive quarter, by nearly 10,000 in the third quarter. It added 93,600 digital video subscribers, 72,400 high-speed data subscribers and 113,100 digital phone subscribers. Last month, the Dolan family, offered to take Cablevision private, valuing the company at $7.9 billion or $27 a share. Bourkoff said in his note, "We believe the privatization process appears on track and will be a key determinant of value for equity and debt investors." Cablevision's shares dipped 7 cents to $27.86 on the New York Stock Exchange.
