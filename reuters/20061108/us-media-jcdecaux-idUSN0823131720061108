 PARIS  (Reuters) - JCDecaux ( JCDX.PA ), the world's No. 2 outdoor advertising group, said on Wednesday it is interested in buying larger rival Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings Inc. ( CCO.N ) in a deal that would create a billboard powerhouse. 

 A merger could make strategic sense for JCDecaux, analysts said, creating a group with consolidated sales of roughly $5 billion and a stock market value of nearly $15 billion. "We have always said we were interested by CCO," a JCDecaux spokeswoman told Reuters. "Our interest (for CCO) relates to their entire outdoor business." A CCO spokeswoman was not immediately available for comment. CCO's future has been in question since parent Clear Channel Communications Inc. ( CCU.N ) started talks with private equity groups Providence Equity Partners, Blackstone Group and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co., which are interested in buying the radio company. This in turn has fueled speculation that whoever buys Clear Channel Communications could sell all or part of its 90 percent interest in its outdoor advertising affiliate to pay off debt. JCDecaux has expressed its interest in recent conversations with at least two of the private-equity teams, the Wall Street Journal said, citing a person familiar with the matter. It was widely known that JCDecaux was interested in joining forces with one of its two U.S. based rivals, CCO or CBS Outdoor, which is owned by CBS Corp. ( CBSa.N ). Some analysts, however, voiced concern over a potentially high price tag, the funding of the deal and regulatory hurdles -- notably in Europe, where CCO is JCDecaux's main competitor. Clear Channel Outdoor has a market value of $8.9 billion while JCDecaux has a market capitalization of $5.9 billion. If JCDecaux managed to grab CCO it would become "the unmistakable leader in the outdoor business with around 45 percent of the worldwide market and an even higher market share in street furniture," Fortis Bank analysts said in a note. But Fortis Bank said issues remained, such as the scope of any deal, the possible dilution of the family controlling shareholders' stake and the price that JCDecaux would pay. The Decaux family owns over 70 percent of the group's capital. In afternoon trading, JCDecaux shares fell 2.26 percent to 20.36 euros, while CCO shares fell 12 cents to $25.04 on the New York Stock Exchange. A BOLD DEAL UBS said a deal would be a "bold move" for JCDecaux and require a combination of cash and shares, with the JCDecaux family likely to lower its stake below 50 percent. Ixis Securities said it expected "strong synergies" in billboard and transport advertising if a deal came through. "Combining Clear Channel and JCDecaux would create one of the few global media companies in the world with a lot of potential growth," JCDecaux Co-Chief Executive Jean-Francois Decaux told the Journal. "Of course we're interested." Analysts said that JCDecaux might only be able to buy or interested in purchasing part of CCO. Whether that would be its U.S. or international business was a subject of debate. Deutsche Bank said in a research note on Wednesday that a "transaction would make sense, especially overseas," but that whether CCO would want to sell its domestic U.S. business would be an important issue. "We believe a sale of the international unit separately is a possibility," Deutsche Bank said. Decaux is strong in Europe and Asia but weaker in the United States, so there should be few U.S. antitrust concerns. But authorities could look at local markets for overlap. But Exane BNP Paribas cautioned in a recent note that JCDecaux might run into trouble acquiring the European business of CCO since both companies "have a very significant market share" in many European countries. "It could however be interested in the U.S. business," the note said. (Additional reporting by  Michael Flaherty  and  Paul Thomasch  in New York)
