 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Former Tyco International Ltd. ( TYC.N ) Chief Executive Dennis Kozlowski has reached a deal to sell his Colorado home for $10 million, court papers show. 

 Kozlowski will sell the Beaver Creek, Colorado home and its contents to an unidentified buyer, according to papers filed with the Supreme Court of New York. The furnishings -- including kitchen appliances, electronics and satellite systems -- will sell for an additional $750,000. Kozlowski's net proceeds after closing costs and the broker's fee are estimated at $9.1 million, the papers show. Mac Hodge, a real estate broker with Prudential Colorado, said the home was under contract but declined to identify the buyer. Kozlowski and former Tyco finance chief Mark Swartz were convicted in June 2005 of stealing more than $150 million from the conglomerate. Both are serving sentences of up to 25 years, and are appealing their convictions. Kozlowski is imprisoned at the Downstate Correctional Facility in Fishkill, New York, an hour from Manhattan. When Kozlowski was sentenced in September 2005, he was required to pay $134 million in restitution and a fine of $70 million, according to the papers filed by New York District Attorney Robert Morgenthau.
