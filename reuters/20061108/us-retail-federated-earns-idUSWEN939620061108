 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Federated Department Stores Inc. FD.N reported a quarterly loss and weaker-than-expected sales on Wednesday, as the parent of Macy's struggles to boost sales at the May Department Stores it acquired last year. 

 Federated, which is also the parent of Bloomingdale's, posted a loss of $3 million, or 1 cent per share, for its fiscal third quarter ended October 28, compared with profit of $436 million, or 90 cents per share a year ago. Excluding May merger integration costs and inventory valuation adjustments of $145 million, Federated said its third-quarter earnings per share from continuing operations were 20 cents, below analysts' average estimate of 25 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. "The May stores are proving to be a little more difficult to turn around than originally anticipated," said Arun Daniel, a senior analyst at ING Investment Management."... I think the market was clearly anticipating a much faster pace than the current pace that it's happening." Shares declined 56 cents, or 1.4 percent to $39.76 in midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Federated's shares have risen almost 22 percent year-to-date through Tuesday. Federated acquired May Department Stores last year and converted more than 400 former May stores, such as Foley's, Hecht's and Filene's, to the Macy's name in September, creating a national chain of more than 800 Macy's stores. It is now working to improve sales at the old May chains, bringing in new merchandise, such as Macy's own INC and Alfani brands, and tailoring the stores to fit the local market. In September, it unleashed the largest advertising campaign in its history to promote the new, national Macy's chain. But the name change was not popular with all shoppers and investors are waiting to see if Macy's will be able attract former May shoppers to its stores. On a conference call, Chief Financial Officer Karen Hoguet said sales lagged in Macy's home business, which accounts for roughly 15 percent of sales. "In the new Macy's (stores), it was the home store that was by far the most disappointing," she said. She said sales in that business were hurt in part by the lower promotional activity at Macy's compared with May and "the general industry softness in home categories." Federated said quarterly sales rose 6 percent to $5.89 billion, missing analysts' expectations of $6.11 billion. Sales at stores open at least a year -- a key measurement of a retailer's health known as same-stores sales -- increased 5.9 percent. Federated had forecast total sales of $5.9 billion to $6.1 billion for the third-quarter and a same-store sales increase of between 3 percent and 5 percent. Craig Johnson, president of retail consulting firm Customer Growth Partners, said the heat is now on for Federated heading into the holidays. "This season will be the 'show me' season," he said. "There will be a lot of attention by investors and analysts on this season." For the fourth-quarter, Federated said it still expects a same-store sales rise of 3 percent to 5 percent, total sales of $9.1 billion to $9.4 billion and earnings per share, excluding merger integration costs and related inventory valuation adjustments, of $1.40 to $1.50. Analysts, on average, are expecting sales of $9.21 billion and earnings of it to $1.52 per share, according to Reuters Estimates.
