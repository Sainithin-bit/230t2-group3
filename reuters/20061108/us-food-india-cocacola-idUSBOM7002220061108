 MUMBAI  (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co. ( KO.N ) plans to invest $250 million in its Indian bottling arm to restructure its marketing and distribution operations, the Economic Times paper reported on Wednesday, citing unnamed sources. 

 Hindustan Coca-Cola Beverages would realign its capacities and add new facilities for new products, the paper said. The company would also buy out excess capacity from franchisee bottlers, the paper said. A company spokesman declined to comment on the report. "As an FMCG (fast moving consumer goods) company, we are constantly investing in our operations to extend our reach and strengthen our presence in the market," he told Reuters.
