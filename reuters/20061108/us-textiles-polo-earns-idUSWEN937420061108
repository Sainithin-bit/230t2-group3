 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Polo Ralph Lauren Corp. ( RL.N ) on Wednesday said second-quarter earnings rose 31 percent as the luxury apparel and home goods company benefited from increased demand for Ralph Lauren-branded products, and it raised its full-year earnings forecast. 

 Sales at its wholesale and its stand-alone retail operations rose, and its shares jumped as much as 4 percent in mid-morning trade. "Their business is absolutely smoking," said Pacific Growth Equities analyst Christine Chen, adding that the company is on track for a strong holiday selling season since "fall trends are a general indication for holiday." For the quarter ended September 30, the company reported net income of $137 million, or $1.28 per share, compared with $104.2 million, or 97 cents per share, for the second quarter of fiscal 2006. Sales climbed 14 percent to $1.17 billion. Analysts surveyed by Reuters Estimates had expected the company to report an average profit of $1.06 per share, on revenue of $1.16 billion. The maker of Ralph Lauren Purple Label, Polo and Chaps clothing also said it agreed to buy the New Campaign group from Kellwood Co. KWD.N. The business has been a Polo Ralph Lauren licensing partner for the manufacturing and distribution of men's and women's belts and other small leather goods under the Ralph Lauren, Lauren and Chaps lines in the United States. EXPANSION The company said it plans to aggressively expand internationally, focusing on Western Europe, China, India and Japan. Currently, it does about 15 percent of its business in Europe, about 15 percent in Asia and about 70 percent in the United States. "Our next three-year plan, I think, will have us investing more time, money, advertising, marketing and resources to accelerate those regions," said Roger Farah, president and chief operating officer, in a conference call with analysts and investors. Still, he added, "To move from a 15-15-70 mix, to a third (in each region) is a long-term project and I think we need to understand it could be a five to 10-year time horizon." Polo Ralph Lauren also said that many new stores will carry the Ralph Lauren name, and that it will likely open more children's stores. Any increase in children's stores could have implications for other high-end kids apparel companies, such as Gymboree Corp.'s GYMB.O Janie and Jack unit or even Abercrombie & Fitch Co.'s ( ANF.N ) children's line, Pacific Growth's Chen said. OUTLOOK For the third quarter, the company said it expects revenue growth in the "low double-digits" on increasing sales at retail and wholesale units. Analysts had expected third-quarter sales of $1.11 billion, up 11 percent from the year-ago period. Polo Ralph Lauren also raised its full-year earnings-per-share forecast to $3.50 to $3.60, from $3.25 to $3.35. Analysts were looking for earnings of $3.37 per share. Shares rose $1.75 to $73.35. The stock is up 75 percent so far this year, compared with a 16 percent gain in the Standard & Poor's textiles apparel index .GSPTEX. Shares of Polo Ralph Lauren are selling for 18.7 times next year's expected earnings, while competitor Kellwood is selling for 15.2 times earnings.
