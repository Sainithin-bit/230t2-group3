 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Bankrupt auto parts maker Delphi Corp. DPHIQ.PK said on Wednesday it would delay filing its third quarter earnings report after determining its designation of foreign currency hedges may not satisfy accounting rules. 

 The potential change would not affect cash flows, but could change the timing of previously deferred gains or losses, it said in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Delphi also said it would ask lenders who provided bankruptcy financing for more time to complete the filing. Delphi in October settled fraud charges with the SEC stemming from accounting improprieties that led to several years of restated earnings. It neither admitted nor denied the charges and was not subjected to a financial penalty.
