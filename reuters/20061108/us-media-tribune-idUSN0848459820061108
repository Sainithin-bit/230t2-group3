 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Los Angeles billionaire philanthropist Eli Broad and investor Ron Burkle have made a bid to buy newspaper publisher and broadcaster Tribune Co. TRB.N, a source close to the situation said on Wednesday. 

 Affiliates of the Broad Investment Co. and Burkle's Yucaipa Companies made the bid, the source told Reuters. No other details were available. Broad and Burkle were not immediately available for comment. A Tribune spokesman declined comment. The news of Broad's and Burkle's bid comes a day after Los Angeles Times editor Dean Baquet said he would leave the paper, which is one of Tribune's biggest properties, after Baquet lost a battle to resist job cuts. Tribune has received several preliminary offers for the company from private-equity firms, sources familiar with the matter have said. One group includes Texas Pacific Group and Thomas H. Lee Partners; another consists of Madison Dearborn Partners, Providence Equity Partners and Apollo Management; and Bain Capital also put in a bid, the sources have said. Some of those bids came in low, according to media reports, so Tribune is considering selling individual properties, which include 11 daily newspapers and about two-dozen local television stations as well as the Chicago Cubs baseball team. Tribune shares rose 78 cents, or 2.5 percent, to $32.40 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
