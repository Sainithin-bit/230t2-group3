 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Sirius Satellite Radio Inc. ( SIRI.O ) on Wednesday reported a smaller third-quarter net loss as revenue more than doubled on a sharp increase in subscribers to its fee-based service. 

 Sirius, whose service is the exclusive home to shock jock Howard Stern, also reiterated its forecast for 6.3 million users by the end of the year, with total 2006 revenue at $615 million and 2007 revenue of $1 billion. The results set the stage for a hot contest in the fourth quarter, when Sirius and rival XM Satellite Radio Holdings Inc. XMSR.O will battle to woo holiday shoppers to sign up or give the radios as gifts. Both offer subscriptions at up to $13 a month. "Sirius reported a solid result that mirrored peer XM's in its notable absence of disappointments," Sanford Bernstein analyst Craig Moffitt said in client note. "With their release coming five weeks into the fourth quarter ... their affirmation of year-end guidance is likely to be a welcome sign that the fourth quarter is already off to a strong start." Sirius' net loss narrowed to $162.9 million, or 12 cents a share, from $180.4 million, or 14 cents per share, a year earlier. Analysts on average had expected a loss of 14 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue for the New York-based company was $167.1 million, just shy of the analysts' view of $168.6 million. Both Sirius and XM are growing rapidly, but losing money as they beef up their technologies and enlist top-shelf entertainment, such as Sirius deals with the National Football League, Nascar and Stern. Both companies earlier this year briefly halted making some models because they were not compliant with federal guidelines. This week, each voiced optimism about the holiday season, saying that they will have enough product to meet demand. "What we have seen in each year is that the holiday season has loomed large," Sirius Chief Financial Officer David Freer told Reuters in an interview. "We have seen huge gift-volume in each of the last three years and we are anticipating that will be the case again this year." During the third quarter, Sirius added about 441,000 net subscribers for a total of 5.1 million. The cost of acquiring each customer decreased 23 percent to $114 from $149, due to the reduction in average subsidy rates as the company continued to reduce manufacturing and chip set costs. On Monday, XM, whose offerings include Major League Baseball and an Oprah Winfrey channel, said it also had pared its quarterly loss and ended the quarter with 7.2 million subscribers. Sirius shares rose 1.2 percent, or 5 cents, to $4.14 on Nasdaq late on Wednesday. The stock has slipped about 40 percent this year, but has risen 10 percent since XM's results were released on Monday. XM shares were up 5 cents at $13.54.
