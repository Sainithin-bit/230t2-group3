 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - NYSE Group Inc., which owns the largest U.S. stock exchange, said on Wednesday it will slash 520 jobs, or nearly 18 percent of its work force, in the latest sign of wrenching changes in the once not-for-profit exchange sector. 

 Four hundred employees and 120 full-time consultants at the New York Stock Exchange and other business units will be affected by the cuts, the company said in a statement. An NYSE spokesman declined to elaborate on the statement's contents. The cuts aim to reduce costs and get rid of duplicate services following the NYSE's March takeover of electronic trading platform Archipelago Holdings Inc., a deal which turned it into a publicly listed company. That takeover brought more automation to the storied exchange, which has also come under increasing competitive pressure from its biggest rival, the all-electronic Nasdaq  ( NDAQ.O ). Over 950 out of 3,484 employees have lost jobs at the NYSE since March 2005, bringing the layoffs to about 35 percent of its work force, the company said. The latest cuts are unlikely to be the last. "This move was almost overdue. And there's more on the way," said Richard A. Herr, analyst at financial services firm Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. In a long-anticipated move last week, the NYSE said it will shut down one of its five trading rooms around Wall Street, citing its hybrid trading platform and cost cutting efforts as reasons. That plan meant probable layoffs for the specialist firms whose employees have traditionally handled stock trading, rather than jobs at the exchange itself. Herr said the latest cuts, the largest to date, were a sign of how the NYSE is adapting to Archipelago's electronic model, adding that he still expects the exchange to maintain some form of floor trading. The job cuts also signal the exchange's focus on profitability, now that it is a public company, said John Jakobson, a former seat holder at the NYSE. "This is all to make this place extraordinarily profitable for shareholders. That has been the objective since the beginning and John Thain has made no mistake," Jakobson said. The NYSE had previously outlined cost savings of $200 million over 2 years. "They told us the numbers, they just didn't tell us how they would get there. Now we know," Herr said. The NYSE said about 150 employees of the Securities Industry Automation Corp. included in the latest job cuts will join the American Stock Exchange. NYSE said last month it was buying the remaining portion of SIAC that it did not own from the Amex. The NYSE Regulation operation will not be affected by this move.
