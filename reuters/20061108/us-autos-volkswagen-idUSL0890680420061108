 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Surprise news that Volkswagen's ( VOWG.DE ) chief executive will resign at year's end left investors guessing on Wednesday about what the future holds for top lieutenant and reform driver Wolfgang Bernhard. 

 Analysts said Bernhard could be a casualty in the fallout from the unexplained departure of CEO Bernd Pischetsrieder, and said they were concerned that VW, Europe's largest carmaker, could lose the focus on cost-cutting he has driven. Citigroup downgraded the stock to "hold" from "buy", saying both Bernhard and group finance chief Hans Dieter Poetsch -- two top Pischetsrieder allies -- could wind up as collateral damage. "At worse, the positions of CFO Poetsch, responsible for capital discipline, and VW Brand CEO Bernhard, responsible for driving production savings, could be in jeopardy," it wrote. VW was not available for comment on the situation. Chosen by Pischetsrieder to head the VW brand, the 46-year old restructuring expert with the movie-star looks has been at the forefront of VW's campaign to slash costs and jobs at the group's troubled western German operations. Bernhard is responsible for delivering 7 billion euros ($8.9 billion) in gross earnings improvements at the VW brand by 2008, and has aggressively looked to prune benefits and extend working hours for the roughly 100,000 workers at the six traditional VW plants in western Germany. His presence has been seen as a guarantee that the far-reaching changes necessary at Volkswagen would not be hijacked by special interests within the company resistant to surrendering VW's historically cozy system of consensus-based decisions, influenced in part through labor's co-management. Martin Winterkorn, the head of the Audi premium division and protege of powerful VW Chairman Ferdinand Piech, will replace Pischetsrieder, the company said late on Tuesday. Markets fear that a Bernhard departure would undermine reforms at a company still recovering from cronyism blamed for a series of scandals last year, which included criminal investigations of bribery, fraud and paid sexual favors. "If he goes, the stock is going to go way down," an automotive analyst said, declining to be named. German bank HVB said VW's refusal to explain the CEO's sudden resignation raised the question of whether the focus and cost discipline that Pischetsrieder championed would continue. Focus magazine of Germany reported that Pischetsrieder, whose contract was just extended six months ago until April 2012, resigned after confronting opposition from five of the six members of the supervisory board's key steering committee, led in particular by all three labor representatives. Its shares swung through a wide 3-euro range and were off 1.4 percent at 80.08 euros by 1105 GMT, the leading decliner in the DJ Stoxx European car sector index .SXAP. The stock has been the index's second-best performer this year. CHASED OUT OF DAIMLER The market had already speculated whether Bernhard would throw in the towel, frustrated by the highly sensitive politics prevalent at a company where 97 percent of its German workers are organized through the powerful IG Metall trade union and labor representatives make up half of the supervisory board. Bernhard, a no-nonsense manager with little patience for bureaucracy endemic to former state-owned companies such as Volkswagen, has already run into problems with powerful German works councils in the past. In April 2004, DaimlerChrysler's DCXGn.DE supervisory board blocked Bernhard from taking over as head of the Mercedes Car Group. The move came just days before he was set to assume the post, amid German media reports that labor was out for blood following reported comments that he called former pearl Mercedes a "restructuring case". "A change of (Volkswagen) management at the highest level at such a sensitive time will raise questions about deeper internal conflict amongst management," Morgan Stanley said in a note. "Some investors may speculate that this may hasten Dr. Bernhard's departure from VW and possible return to DCX to head the Mercedes car business, or to rescue Chrysler," the bank continued.
