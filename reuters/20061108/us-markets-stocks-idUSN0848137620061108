 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rose on Wednesday as U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld resigned a day after Democrats regained control of the U.S. House, fueling hopes for a change in Iraq policy and less government spending. 

 Helping tech stocks, Microsoft Corp. ( MSFT.O ) set a rock-solid date for its new operating system, and a gain in oil prices drove up shares of energy companies, including Exxon Mobil Corp. ( XOM.N ). Strong results from Cisco Systems Inc. ( CSCO.O ) after hours may boost sentiment on Thursday. However, the election results hurt sectors such as drugs, with Democrats seen likely to increase legislation in that area. The American Stock Exchange index of drug stocks .DRG fell 1.6 percent. "There's a sense that things in Iraq aren't going the way people had hoped. Along with that, it's costing us a tremendous amount of money to be there, which is killing our budget (with) deficits," said Hans Olsen, chief investment officer at Bingham Legg Advisers in Boston. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  rose 19.77 points, or 0.16 percent, to end at 12,176.54, a record closing high. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  added 2.88 points, or 0.21 percent, to finish at 1,385.72. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  gained 9.06 points, or 0.38 percent, to close at 2,384.94. All three indexes rose for the third straight day. After the closing bell, shares of Cisco gained 3.6 percent to $26 in extended trade after the network equipment maker reported quarterly profit and revenue that beat Wall Street's expectations. The stock closed on Nasdaq at $25.10, up 1.1 percent, or 26 cents. During the regular session, Microsoft, whose shares gained 0.1 percent, or 3 cents, to $29.98 on Nasdaq, said the next version of its Windows operating system, called Vista, is "rock solid and ready to ship" and will be available to retail customers on January 30.  Shares of No. 1 personal computer maker Hewlett-Packard Co. ( HPQ.N ) gained 0.5 percent, or 18 cents, to $38.88 on the  NYSE. CHILL WIND FOR DRUGS AND DEFENSE In U.S. elections on Tuesday, Democrats wrested control of the U.S. House of Representatives from Republicans and were within one seat of a victory in the Senate. Results were still being tallied by late afternoon on Wednesday.  Shares of drug maker Merck & Co. ( MRK.N ) dropped 3.4 percent, or $1.56, to $44.34 on the NYSE, while Pfizer Inc.'s ( PFE.N ) shares fell 1.6 percent, or 43 cents, to $26.62. The two Dow components were among the biggest drags on both the Dow and the S&P 500. In addition, Merck faces a potential $5.58 billion in tax liabilities from U.S and Canadian authorities related to disputes over accounting for past transactions, the company said in a filing on Tuesday. Shares of defense contractor Lockheed Martin ( LMT.N ) also fell, ending down 1.2 percent, or $1.04, at $86.45. Also under pressure were shares of Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ( WMT.N ), the world's largest retailer and a Dow component. The discounter is also among companies likely to come under the Democrats' scrutiny. Its shares fell 1.3 percent, or 62 cents, to $47.03 on the NYSE. EXXON MOBIL CLIMBS Oil futures rose 90 cents to settle at $59.83 a barrel. Shares of Exxon Mobil climbed 2.2 percent, or $1.60, to $74.13 on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock, which also benefited from a broker's price target upgrade, was a top contributor to the gains in both the Dow and S&P 500. Shares of ConocoPhillips ( COP.N ) rose 2.3 percent, or $1.38, to  $62.37. Trading was active on the NYSE, with about 1.70 billion shares changing hands, above last year's daily average of 1.61 billion, while on Nasdaq, about 2.20 billion shares traded, above last year's daily average of 1.80 billion. Advancing stocks outnumbered declining ones by a ratio of about 7 to 4 on the NYSE, and on Nasdaq, by about 3 to 2.
