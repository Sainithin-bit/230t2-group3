 MEXICO CITY  Nov 7 (Reuters) - Mexican tycoon Carlos Slim
is getting rid of the holding company he uses to control his
flagship cell phone operator, America Movil, to simplify the
ownership structure and free up cash for shareholders.  America Movil, with more than 113 million wireless
subscribers across Latin America, will pay 4.07128 shares for
every share of holding company America Telecom.  The only significant investment of America Telecom
AMTELA1.MX, controlled by Slim's family, is a 41 percent
stake in America Movil ( AMXL.MX ) ( AMX.N ).  America Movil said the new arrangement would increase by
12.5 billion pesos ($1.15 billion) the amount it can put toward
share buybacks or dividends without having to pay more taxes.  America Movil also said the new structure would simplify
shareholders' decision-making and investment plans and boost
trading volume for its stock, already one of Latin America's
most traded.  Shares of America Movil rose 0.55 percent to 23.62 pesos
ahead of the announcement, while America Telecom was up 1.46
percent at 85.69 pesos.  The mobile phone company said it would take on America
Telecom's debt of 13.8 billion pesos.  Slim, who also has construction, retail and industrial
interests, controls Mexico's dominant fixed-line phone
operator, Telmex TELMEXL.MX TMX.N, through holding company
Carso Global Telecom TELECOMA1.MX.  Earlier on Tuesday, an industry source told Reuters that
America Movil was one of two unnamed bidders for TIM
Participacoes, the No. 2 Brazilian wireless operator, but did
not say how much the Mexican telecom heavyweight has offered.
