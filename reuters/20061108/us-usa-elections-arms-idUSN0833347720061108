 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Shares in defense companies fell on Wednesday after a strong showing by Democrats in mid-term elections soured the long-term outlook for U.S. military spending. 

 "This may make the outlook for the next presidential elections more favorable for the Democrats...and that could have long-term implications on defense spending," said Paul Nisbet, an analyst at aerospace and defense specialist JSA Research. But in the short-term there is little risk to the defense budget and he advised clients to buy on weakness. Standard & Poor's Aerospace and Defense index .GSPAERO fell 0.8 percent in afternoon trading, led by declines in a major defense contractors Northrop Grumman ( NOC.N ), General Dynamics ( GD.N ), and Raytheon ( RTN.N ). In Tuesday's elections, Democrats swept Republicans from power in the U.S. House of Representatives and were close to winning control of the Senate. Dissatisfaction over the war in Iraq was a key factor in the election, with the Democrats vowing a change of strategy, but not going so far as to promise an immediate withdrawal. The poor showing by the Republicans, U.S. President George W. Bush's party, was quickly followed by the resignation of controversial Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld. Despite the departure of Rumsfeld and the setback for the Republicans, defense spending is expected to remain strong at least for the next two years. The U.S. defense budget is likely to top $500 billion in fiscal year 2007, plus separate requests to fund the operations in Iraq and Afghanistan "This development should not, in our view, have much near-term impact on defense contractors beyond headline risk," Robert Stallard, an analyst with Bank of America, said in a note. "Neither political party will want to be seen to be denying the troops with two years to run to the presidential election." On the New York Stock Exchange, Northrop Grumman shares were down 1.7 percent to $65.25. General Dynamics fell 1.6 percent to $70.86. Raytheon dipped 1.4 percent to $48.98.
