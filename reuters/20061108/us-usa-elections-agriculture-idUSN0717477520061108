 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Rep. Collin Peterson of Minnesota, a supporter of crop subsidies, is in position to become leader of the Agriculture Committee now that Democrats have won a majority in the House of Representatives. 

 Peterson was a pre-election booster of $3 billion in disaster relief for farmers and ranchers because of drought in the Plains and western Corn Belt this year. He said that Congress would probably pass the aid later this month. During an October interview, Peterson said he thought most of the Agriculture Committee membership "believes we should have a continuation" of the comparatively generous crop and dairy supports now in place. Leaders of the Senate Agriculture Committee also leaned toward retention of crop supports that date from the Depression era. A coalition of fiscal hawks, small-farm advocates and fruit, vegetable, nut and nursery crop farmers want to put more attention -- and money -- into land stewardship and public nutrition programs such as food stamps. Private consultant John Schnittker said Peterson "is generally a big subsidy guy" with a constituency that opposes any cuts in subsidies. In October, Peterson was cool to proposals that would lower the current limit of $360,000 a year in subsidies per farmer, a stance that may be indicative of how he wants Congress to update a $20 billion farm law due to expire in September 2007. With Democratic gains, lawmakers are likely to give more support to "green" payments and public nutrition, said two analysts before the election. Two newly elected senators, Democrats Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Bob Casey of Pennsylvania, are supporters of mandatory country-of-origin labels on red meat. Klobuchar says she wants a seat on the Senate Agriculture Committee. Casey defeated Republican Sen. Rick Santorum, an Agriculture subcommittee chairman. In Minnesota, Democrat Tim Walz defeated Republican Rep. Gil Gutknecht, chairman of a House Agriculture subcommittee. In early 2005, Peterson became the Democratic leader on the committee, succeeding Charlie Stenholm of Texas. Peterson was a co-founder of Blue Dog Democrats, a group of fiscally conservative House Democrats. A former accountant and occasional guitar player in an amateur rock band, Peterson, 62, was elected to his ninth term in the House on Tuesday. His district in western Minnesota is home to dairy and grain farms. Sugar beets are grown in the Red River valley adjoining North and South Dakota.
