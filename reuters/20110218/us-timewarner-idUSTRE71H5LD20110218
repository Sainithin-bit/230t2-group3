 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Ousted Time Inc chief Jack Griffin defended his record at the media company on Friday, declaring it was neither his management style nor a lack of results that culminated in his surprise departure. 

 Time Warner Inc ( TWX.N ) ousted Griffin, hired to head its storied magazine division less than six months ago, because of what insiders called a polarizing management style. In a statement, Griffin did not explain why he was asked to leave. But he said he had the "consistent and documented acclaim of Time Warner's senior management". "I was recruited and hired by Time Warner to lead the business transformation of Time Inc, based on my clear record of success and results in the industry," Griffin said in his statement. "Every action I took over the past six months was made with that ultimate goal in mind. My exit was clearly not about management style or results." "I leave behind a first-rate team and wish them all the best of success," he added. (Reporting by  Edwin Chan , editing by Gerald E. McCormick)
