 PARIS  (Reuters) - A Group of 20 statement this weekend is likely to omit wording on advanced economies being vigilant to volatile currency moves in favor of a reference to broad efforts to reform the global monetary system, a G20 source said on Thursday. 

 In a communique from their last meeting in October, finance ministers from the group of the world's big economies agreed "advanced economies, including those with reserve currencies, would be vigilant against excess volatility and disorderly movements in exchange rates." The official with knowledge of work on the communique said there was likely to be a change at the meeting ending on Saturday. "Probably the sentence on advanced economies remaining vigilant against excess volatility and disorderly movement will be taken off," the source, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters. Instead, there would be a sentence in the communique about reforming the international monetary system to deal with high volatility in exchange rates. French President Nicholas Sarkozy has called for a new Bretton Woods system for managing the world economy but just months into France's G20 presidency, officials are playing down hopes of any major breakthrough on monetary reform. Sarkozy had said last year he would make discussion of how to wean the world off its reliance on the dollar a top priority of his year-long stewardship but has since appeared to moderate a tone in the face of Washington's intransigence. Another G20 source told Reuters last week that the group would likely encourage emerging countries to let their currencies float more freely when they meet this week, in a repeat of language used last year. That official added the group was not expected to single out any one country in its language on currency. (Editing by Mike Peacock)
