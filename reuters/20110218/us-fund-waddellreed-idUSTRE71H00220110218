 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. stocks are primed to head higher, but Washington's fiscal straits hang over the market and will eventually cause a pullback, the chief executive of money manager Waddell & Reed Financial Inc ( WDR.N ) said on Thursday. 

 A lack of political will to address the U.S. deficit and agree on a budget is the biggest challenge investors face in a market that is the most complex he has ever seen, said Henry Herrmann, who in March will complete 40 years at Overland Park, Kansas-based Waddell. "You have this conflict at a critical time," he said. "We need to do something about the debt ceiling, come up with a budget and decide on these fiscal matters on a long-term basis." U.S. government spending as a percentage of gross domestic product has grown to 24 percent in 2010 -- about one-fourth more than in recent years. That is one reason why it is difficult to have "table-pounding confidence" in the stock market, Herrmann said. Yet large-cap U.S. stocks, which have doubled in price since touching a decade-low in March 2009 and are now well above their 200-day moving average, continue to march higher in a surge that has confounded many investors. "We're all in shock that the market has now doubled from its low, and everybody in the professional world I talk to seems to be a fully invested bear," said Herrmann, who started as a junior analyst at Chase Manhattan Bank in 1963. At the same time, the government and Federal Reserve are propping up the U.S. economy, leading most people to conclude that corporate profits will improve, stocks will go up and price-earnings ratios can go higher, Herrmann said. Also, investors who put money into various fixed-income assets during the economic crisis are beginning to buy U.S. equities, as witnessed by fund flows data. "We still seem to be climbing a wall of worry, which generally speaking is good," he said. Rising inflation in India and China, and to a lesser degree in Brazil, will cause problems in emerging markets, making U.S. stocks the choice of global investors, he said. Herrmann, who was in New York to introduce a year-long branding campaign for the Ivy Funds -- mutual funds with about $44 billion under management -- said he favors industrials, energy and technology stocks. Overall, Waddell & Reed has about $84 billion in assets under management.
