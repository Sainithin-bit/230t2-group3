 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker, in a sweeping criticism of the financial system, called on the U.S. government to do more to stem the credit crisis, in a speech on Tuesday. 

 Volcker questioned why the Federal Reserve under the leadership of current Chairman Ben Bernanke has been shouldering the burden of fixing the mortgage market, when the government has other tools to defuse what he called the "mother of all crises." The actions taken so far by the Fed to loosen lending markets and soften the blow to the economy have taken the central bank to the "edge of its lawful and implied powers," Volcker, who was named Fed chairman in 1979 and served until 1987, said in a speech at the Economic Club of New York. Since rising defaults in subprime mortgages led to a broader credit morass last August, the Fed has slashed its benchmark interest rate by 300 basis points, increased its emergency lending facilities, and pledged to take on some of the toxic securities plaguing bank balance sheets. Volcker, however, said the government-backed agencies created to support the U.S. mortgage market, such as Fannie Mae FNM.N and Freddie Mac FRE.N, should do more to end the current crisis. "In the here and now, if the illiquidity of the mortgage market is the crux of the problem, use of the existing institutions would be quicker and more effective now than building a new channel for government assistance," said Volcker, who during his tenure as Fed chairman faced double-digit inflation and two recessions. "At any rate, the crisis is simply too threatening to rule out the possibility of government support," he said. In systematic fashion, Volcker criticized the financial system that has provided more wealth for some but increased the risks of a cascading breakdown in the entire system. He singled out the use of mathematical modeling, securitization, and off-balance-sheet accounting -- all facets of the housing boom of the last decade and its bust.
