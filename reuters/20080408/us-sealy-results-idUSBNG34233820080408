 (Reuters) - Mattress maker Sealy Corp's ZZ.N first-quarter profit beat market estimates as its branded specialty bedding products business bucked sluggish U.S. retail trends for home furnishings, boosting its shares 10 percent. 

 First-quarter U.S. sales fell 11 percent at the company, which also suspended its quarterly dividend, but revenue from its branded domestic specialty bedding products grew 17 percent and international sales rose 15 percent. Profit at Sealy fell for the third straight quarter as the company struggled with softer U.S. sales in the face of the housing meltdown and rising costs of materials. The company, whose brands include Sealy Posturepedic, Stearns & Foster and Bassett, said earnings fell to $16.2 million, or 17 cents a share, from $24.6 million, or 26 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales fell 5 percent to $391.9 million. Total U.S. net sales fell to $281.3 million. Analysts on average had expected Trinity, North Carolina-based Sealy to earn 10 cents a share, before special items, on revenue of $383.8 million, according to Reuters Estimates. International net sales grew more than 15 percent to $110.6 million during the first quarter. Sealy, whose largest shareholder is buyout firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co, announced the abrupt departure of Chairman and Chief Executive David McIlquham last month, and named Lawrence Rogers interim CEO. The company, whose market value has dropped by more than a third this year, is searching for a permanent replacement. The bedding maker said McIlquham and the board determined it was in Sealy's best interest to seek new leadership. Last month, Sealy's rival Tempur-Pedic ( TPX.N ) forecast a 50 percent drop in first-quarter profit amid concerns of an unprecedented slowdown in the U.S. mattress industry. Sealy's shares rose 10 percent to $7.79 in trading after the bell. They had closed down almost 3 percent at $7.10 Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange.
