 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - American Airlines, a unit of AMR Corp AMR.N, canceled up to 500 flights on Tuesday to conduct additional safety inspections of its MD-80 aircraft, the airline said. 

 American said in a statement that the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) raised new concerns about recent MD-80 wiring inspections that resulted in canceled flights two weeks ago. The current and previous inspections stem from an industry wide FAA review of airline compliance with agency safety directives. Several carriers have grounded aircraft as a result of the audit, which was triggered by inspection and maintenance lapses at Southwest Airlines Co ( LUV.N ) and pressure from government watchdogs and congressional investigators to take action. American said additional cancellations were likely on Wednesday. "We've been working in good faith to ensure that we are in compliance with this airworthiness directive," said Gerard Arpey, AMR's chairman and chief executive. American operates nearly 300 MD-80 aircraft, about half its overall fleet, mainly on routes servicing the carrier's Dallas and Chicago hubs. The inspection at American relate to a 2006 FAA order that wiring in MD-80 wheel wells was properly installed and secured. The FAA had additional questions about how the work was performed at American. Any plane that does not conform to detailed technical specifications of the order will be grounded while the work is completed, American said. American re-accommodated passengers on other American flights or those operated by other airlines. (Editing by  Andre Grenon )
