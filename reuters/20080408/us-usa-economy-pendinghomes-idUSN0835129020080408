 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Pending sales of previously owned homes fell a bigger-than-expected 1.9 percent in February to the lowest reading on record, according to a report from a real estate trade group on Tuesday that pointed to more troubles in the beleaguered housing market. 

  KEY POINTS: * The National Association of Realtors Pending Home Sales Index, based on sales contracts signed in February and seen as a key barometer of future housing sales activity, fell to a reading of 84.6 in February from 86.2. * That was the lowest reading since the trade group began tracking this data in 2001. * Compared to a year ago, pending sales were down 21.4 percent.  COMMENTS:  KIM RUPERT, MANAGING DIRECTOR OF GLOBAL FIXED INCOME ANALYSIS, ACTION ECONOMICS LLC, SAN FRANCISCO: "The data didn't really tell us anything new. We know the housing market is in crisis." "It might suggest some sort of bottoming. We've seen other statistics suggest that as well but I think there is still a lot of pain left in the housing market."  ROBERT BRUSCA, CHIEF ECONOMIST, FACT AND OPINION ECONOMICS, NEW YORK: "It's a substantial drop despite the increase in the Northeast, which I'm skeptical of. Housing sales are still under pressure."  T.J. MARTA, FIXED INCOME STRATEGIST, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS, NEW YORK: "The housing correction continues, with sales still faltering. And when they begin rising, it will be because sellers are capitulating on price, which will cause the realization of net worth destruction. The consumer is becoming conscious of this threat, as indicated by the lagging collapse of the perception about their personal finances."  MICHELLE MEYER, ECONOMIST, LEHMAN BROTHERS, NEW YORK: "Pending home sales fell more than some expected, but it was close to our expectations. Buyers continue to sit on the sidelines and it is very challenging for non-prime borrowers. Prices continue to fall. People do not want to buy a home that is falling in value. The economic outlook is uncertain and consumers are uncertain about their future finances and in response are holding off purchasing a home."  GARY THAYER, SENIOR ECONOMIST, WACHOVIA SECURITIES, ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI: "The pending home sales drop clearly shows that the housing industry still faces problems. It's a buyers' market where there's no real rush to step up and buy. A lot of homes are on the market and even though they are more affordable and interest rates are down, buyers are just holding back."  KURT KARL, HEAD OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH, SWISS RE, NEW YORK: "We are still deteriorating. With pending home sales, the series would have to go back to 1990 to get a worse number up here because we did have a housing slump in 1990, 1991 and 1992 period but we had no housing slump to speak of in 2001 and 2002. So the number of pending home sales is just going to deteriorate probably into the third quarter of this year and then we will start seeing a bottoming out and a flattening of it and the hopefully early next year there will be some strong improvements in pending sales."  STEPHEN MALYON, SENIOR CURRENCY STRATEGIST, SCOTIA CAPITAL, TORONTO: "It doesn't really look like there is a strong reaction. The (pending home sales) numbers were a little bit weaker-than-expected, but not so much so that it really changed the view that the housing market is under pressure. The euro came off ever so slightly, but not to any magnitude that I would really want to ascribe it to the numbers."  SCOTT BROWN, CHIEF ECONOMIST, RAYMOND JAMES & ASSOCIATES, ST PETERSBURG, FLORIDA: "The data suggest we haven't really seen a bottom yet in the housing market. There is a huge mismatch between prices and median incomes. There is potential for further declines in home prices of another 10 percent or 20 percent, especially in areas that have had the biggest run-ups. The big concern is that credit is getting tighter all around, not just for mortgage loans but also for consumer loans and business loans."  TODD LEONE, HEAD OF LISTED TRADING, COWEN & CO., NEW YORK: "They were a little bit worse than expected, and people are coming to expect that... and we keep getting it. You have the FOMC minutes coming out this afternoon, so (the focus) will be on that."  MARKET REACTION: * BONDS: U.S. Treasuries hold gains. * CURRENCIES: The dollar was unchanged. * STOCKS: U.S. stock indexes briefly added to losses. * RATE FUTURES: Held small gains.
