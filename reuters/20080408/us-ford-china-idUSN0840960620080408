 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co ( F.N ) said on Tuesday it had posted a 47 percent gain in first-quarter sales through affiliates in China, with 90,791 vehicles sold. 

 Ford said its passenger car joint-venture, Changan Ford Mazda Automobile, had increased quarterly sales by 58 percent to 61,789 units compared with the same period a year earlier. Jiangling Motor Corp, the joint-venture handling Ford's commercial vehicles like the Ford Transit van, posted sales of 23,785 vehicles, Ford said in a statement. Ford included sales of imported Land Rover and Jaguar models in its first-quarter sales results for China. Ford has sold those brands to Tata Motors Ltd ( TAMO.BO ) in a $2.3 billion deal that closed last month.
