 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Jeans maker Levi Strauss & Co said on Tuesday that quarterly net profit rose 12 percent, helped by lower interest expense and a lower tax rate. 

 The American casual brand, which is privately owned but reports quarterly results due to outstanding debt, said that first-quarter net profit rose to $97 million from $87 million a year earlier. (Reporting by  Alexandria Sage , editing by Richard Chang)
