 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Leon Black's buyout firm Apollo Management is mulling the idea of a "prepackaged" bankruptcy plan for ailing home furnishings retailer Linens 'n Things, the New York Post reported online on Tuesday, citing sources. 

 In the course of such a plan, Apollo and the retailer's creditors would agree on a restructuring plan before filing for Chapter 11, the NY Post reported. Linens 'n Things could not be reached immediately for comment. (Reporting by  Aarthi Sivaraman )
