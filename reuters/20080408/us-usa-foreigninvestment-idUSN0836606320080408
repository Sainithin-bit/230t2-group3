 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The Treasury Department said on Tuesday it will release rules by the end of this month clarifying how the government will vet acquisitions involving foreign buyers for national security risks. 

 The long-awaited update is part of legislation passed last year aimed at tightening government oversight of cross-border deals in the wake of the controversy sparked by Dubai Ports' purchase of a company that operated U.S. ports. "We are expecting to release the draft FINSA regulations for public comment by the end of the month," said Treasury spokesman Rob Saliterman. Treasury has already sent other agencies a draft of the rules, sources familiar with the process said. The updated rules come as debate intensifies over the role of government-owned funds that have bought billion-dollar stakes in some of the largest U.S. banks whose balance sheets have been battered by the subprime mortgage mess. Critics of these sovereign wealth funds worry that they may seek to base investment decisions on political rather than financial gain. Companies involved in international mergers -- and the lawyers who represent them -- have been eager for clearer guidance on which deals would require special government review. Treasury officials had said that wealth funds would get closer scrutiny under the new rules. "What I think the regulation will really do, is take the broad category of government-owned entity and stipulate that it can mean sovereign wealth fund," said Todd Malan, president of the Organization for International Investment, a trade group that represents foreign companies. The reviews are conducted by a panel led by the U.S. Treasury Department called the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS. The panel includes representatives from the departments of Commerce, Defense and Justice. NO 10 PCT THRESHOLD The revised rules are also expected to clear up a misconception that CFIUS will not review a deal that involves a stake smaller than 10 percent. "Treasury has been debating internally and expected to clarify on the 10 percent threshold," said Bruce Josten, executive vice president for government affairs at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Malan said: "I think they will make it very clear that if there is control and national security risk, it doesn't matter the percentage of ownership. "People make a mistake when they only look to the percentage of ownership. You really have to do a deeper dive on are there other mechanisms of control at work, because if there are, CFIUS will review the deal," he said. Earlier this year, three House Democrats told the Treasury Department that the laws were not sufficiently clear to determine the criteria to trigger a national security review. House Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank urged the department to clarify that the 10 percent threshold is only one measure of control and does not represent a bright line below which CFIUS has no ability or intent to review a transaction. "The regulations should not give the false impression that investments below this threshold are also below the radar in terms of the CFIUS's ability to do its work," said Frank's letter to the Treasury Department. Carolyn Maloney from New York and Luis Gutierrez of Illinois also signed the letter. Treasury would not comment on the substance of the draft. (Editing by Leslie Adler)
