 AMSTERDAM  (Reuters) - TomTom ( TOM2.AS ), the Dutch navigation device maker, cut its 2008 revenue outlook on Tuesday and warned price cuts would hit first quarter sales and profits, sending the stock to a 32-month low. 

 The maker of portable navigation devices (PNDs) for cars and mapping software for handheld computers said quarterly sales would fall year-on-year for the first time since the company went public in 2005. Its 2.9 billion euro ($4.56 billion) bid for digital map maker Tele Atlas TA.AS remains on track, TomTom said. The Amsterdam-based firm now expects first quarter sales of 260 million to 270 million euros ($409-$425 million), well below an average forecast of 347 million euros from analysts polled by Reuters Estimates. Analyst forecasts range from 290 million to 418 million euros for the figures, which are due on April 23. Revenue in the same quarter a year earlier was 296 million euros. The Amsterdam-based firm said its operating margin would fall to a low single-digit percentage from 19 percent a year earlier. Shares in TomTom were down 10 percent at 23.79 euros at 0914 GMT after hitting 22.58 euros, their lowest since July 2005. TomTom went public at 17.50 euros per share in May 2005. A weak first quarter would mean full-year 2008 revenue of between 1.8 billion and 2.0 billion euros, TomTom said, cutting a projection of 2.0 billion-2.2 billion made in February. Analysts on average expect revenue of 2.17 billion euros. TomTom kept its forecast for device shipments unchanged at 14 million to 15 million units, indicating price cuts. It expects to achieve a gross margin of 40 percent and operating margin of 20 percent, in line with long-term targets. TomTom said first quarter results would reflect the fact it had cut prices ahead of the introduction of new models and retailers reducing their inventory levels more strongly than expected, especially in Europe. "That's not TomTom specific, it's not even PND specific, it's a generic desire of retailers to shorten their balance sheets," TomTom CEO Harold Goddijn told an analyst conference call. "I don't think it's a slowing down of the market overall." BIGGER PROBLEM? ING analyst Marcel Achterberg said retailers' reluctance to buy devices to hold in stock was understandable considering uncertainty over how the wider economy would develop. "There certainly is a first quarter inventory problem, whether it's a bigger problem is yet unknown," he said. Achterberg said he was concerned that even though market players cut prices aggressively in January and February, this did not help to sell units. This could spell trouble for TomTom's business model of driving volumes through lower prices while using economies of scale to cut costs and maintain profit margins. TomTom said its first-quarter market share in North America and Europe remained strong, with the personal navigation device market doubling in North America and growing by 40 percent from a year earlier. "Inventory levels have been reduced, but PNDs are the fastest-growing consumer product category in the world, and retailers cannot afford not to stock it. At some point we will get the orders," Goddijn said. With new products hitting the market and the summer driving season approaching, Goddijn said: "The outlook for the second quarter in principle is good." Seeking to counter analyst concerns that TomTom may have trouble with the debt for its bid for digital map maker Tele Atlas, Chief Financial Officer Marina Wyatt said the company was "okay" regarding its banking covenants for gearing and interest cover. She would not give further details. Goddijn said the company was committed to the Tele Atlas takeover and expected to get European Union approval. (Editing by Paul Bolding and  Jason Neely )
