 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Washington Mutual Inc ( WM.N ) and its advisers on Monday were working out the final details of the plan for capital injection from investors led by private equity firm TPG, the Wall Street Journal reported online citing a person familiar with the matter. 

 While exact terms are still unclear, the total value of the deal could be as much as almost $7 billion, the Journal said. It was reported earlier that Washington Mutual, the largest U.S. savings and loan, is close to getting a $5 billion injection from investors to ease its need for capital as losses have mounted from subprime mortgages and other loans. Representatives for Seattle-based WaMu and for TPG were not immediately available for comment. (Reporting by  Aarthi Sivaraman ; Editing by Erica Billingham)
