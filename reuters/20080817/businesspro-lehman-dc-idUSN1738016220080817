 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Some analysts are girding for a 
third-quarter loss of $1.8 billion or more from U.S. investment 
bank Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc LEH.N, instead of the 
modest profit they had previously expected, the Wall Street 
Journal reported on Sunday. 

  If losses keep piling up, Lehman could need to raise 
additional capital beyond the $6 billion it got in June, the 
paper said.  Lehman is considering pre-announcing its earnings this 
month, the paper said, citing a person familiar with the 
matter. The end of Lehman's fiscal third quarter is less than 
two weeks away, and the bank typically announces its 
third-quarter earnings in mid-September.  In June, the bank posted its first quarterly loss as a 
public company, of $2.8 billion.  The likelihood of back-to-back quarterly losses is fueled 
by widely anticipated write-downs in a portfolio saddled with 
more than $50 billion in risky real-estate and mortgage assets, 
the Wall Street Journal said.  Lehman declined to comment.  (Reporting by  Megan Davies , editing by Richard Chang)
