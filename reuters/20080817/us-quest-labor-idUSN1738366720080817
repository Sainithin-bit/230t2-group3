 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Qwest Communication International Inc ( Q.N ), a U.S. phone company, and union workers failed to reach a labor agreement by a Sunday morning deadline. 

 The Communication Workers of America said workers will continue reporting to their jobs, and the company said it remains operational. Qwest said it would continue to bargain with the union. The union voted last week to authorize a strike if it could not come to an agreement with the company. (Reporting by  Ritsuko Ando  and  Sarah Coffey , editing by Maureen Bavdek)
