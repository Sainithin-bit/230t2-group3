 PARIS  (Reuters) - French bank Societe Generale defended its handling of the world's biggest trading scandal on Sunday, but admitted its risk systems had failed to detect a 50-billion-euro ($73.3 billion) market bet by a lone trader. 

 Prosecutors said the trader, named as 31-year-old Jerome Kerviel, would remain in custody until Monday after handing himself in on Saturday, and was co-operating with a probe into how the bank ran up $7 billion losses on the illicit deals. "The inquiry ... is extremely fruitful," Jean Michel Aldebert, the head of the financial section of the Paris prosecutors office, told reporters on Sunday afternoon. "The detention is going very well. (Kerviel) is talking about the things he has been accused of," he added. Kerviel's lawyer said he had not committed embezzlement, had "not stolen a single cent" and was "just doing his job". "He took some risks but that's what he is paid for. The bank liquidated his positions in atrocious (market) conditions, so the bank is responsible for losing the 4.9 billion euros," Christian Charriere-Bournazel told Reuters. Many market experts have cast doubt on SocGen's affirmation that a single trader was able to conceal positions that were higher than the gross domestic product of Morocco. In a statement on Sunday, the bank said its staffer created fictitious accounts to make it look as though his positions had been covered, when in fact they remained open. It said he also falsified documents to justify his actions. The anomalous trades only came to light on January 18 and SocGen said the trader had acknowledged "committing unauthorized acts and, particular, creating fictitious operations". SocGen's corporate and investment banking chief Jean-Pierre Mustier said there was no evidence of an accomplice, adding just one trader had unbundled the massive exposure. "If one trader can unwind this transaction, one person can make such a transaction," he said in a conference call. The rogue trader used "very simple (financial) instruments" as a vehicle for his deals, which he then hid using high-tech smoke and mirrors, he said. The shell-shocked bank also defended itself from accusations that its move to unwind the trade distorted the market and might have inadvertently triggered a cut in U.S. interest rates. MOVING MARKETS The bank said its trades accounted for no more than 8 percent of the markets in which Kerviel had taken uncovered bets: futures tied to the Eurostoxx pan-European share index, the German DAX index and the British blue chip FTSE index. Some market analysts have questioned whether these heavy sales orders played a crucial part in the sharp falls seen in world markets at the start of last week -- a drop that helped convince the U.S. Federal Reserve to slash its rates on Tuesday. "We were not the cause (of the slump), we had to submit to it," Mustier said. SocGen says it informed Bank of France Governor Christian Noyer of its crisis last Sunday, but the Fed has said it did not know about the problem when it lowered its rates. Mustier said the trader had used a relatively simple strategy to skirt round the bank's controls but was discovered when he started dabbling in areas he did not understand. PREDATORS WARNED OFF Mustier, who had been expected to take over running the entire bank after being in charge of its most successful unit, is giving up his bonus and taking a 50 percent salary cut. "The buck stops with me and after such a loss I of course offered to resign and my resignation was refused by (Chairman) Daniel Bouton." Bouton also offered to step down but the board asked him to stay on. Some analysts have questioned whether the bank can remain independent following such a blow to its credibility, but a senior advisor to President Nicolas Sarkozy warned that the government would probably intervene if predators made a move. "In this case I don't think the state would remain with its arms crossed if someone, whoever the predator, tried to take advantage of the situation," advisor Henri Guaino told French television. The bank remains baffled as to why one of its more junior trading staff put his career on the line and the bank at risk. "We don't know, we don't understand and it will be for the legal inquiry to find out," Mustier said. There has been no suggestion that Kerviel tried to profit from the deals and his family says he is being made a scapegoat. SocGen has lodged a complaint with police based on three main charges -- fraudulent falsification of bank records, fraudulent use of such records and computer fraud. The various charges carry maximum prison terms of between 2 and 5 years, plus fines of up to 375,000 euro ($550,000).
