 PARIS  (Reuters) - SocGen intends to pay its star players enough to keep them from being poached by competitors as it comes to grips with a $7 billion illicit trading loss, the head of the investment banking division said on Sunday. 

 "I have no doubt a certain number of competitors will try to poach people, but this is not exceptional and will be treated as such and will not impact everyone," said bank executive Jean-Pierre Mustier. "We will make sure we pay individuals and staff within the investment bank and outside in a way which is suitable to retain them," Mustier told a conference call with journalists. He said he saw no reason to change the way people were paid "because we have to follow practices in the various activities in the bank". SocGen's investment bank, which developed a cutting-edge business in financial derivatives, made up about 40 percent of the entire group's net income in the first half of 2007 and has borne much of the embarrassment from the trading loss. "The core of the business is working well. What happened here is not connected to the products we create for clients, it's not a market risk issue, it's not an issue with managing our risk, it's a fraud." He said clients had channeled further business to the bank "in a gesture of support" since the crisis became public. Mustier said he was one person who would not be getting a rise after foregoing his 2007 performance bonus and taking a 50 percent cut in his salary after the rogue trades, blamed on a lone trader, Jerome Kerviel, were uncovered 10 days ago. Until the scandal blew up last week, Mustier, 47, had been seen as heir-apparent to take over eventually from Executive Chairman Daniel Bouton, who is 10 years his senior. A shadow is now hanging over Mustier's future. Asked by Reuters if his own job was on the line, Mustier said: "The buck stops with me and after such a loss I have of course offered to resign and my resignation was refused by Daniel Bouton, so I suspect he should answer your question." The scandal came as a huge blow to the bank's staff and employees but had not impaired its business, said Mustier. "I have to admit that this event is a massive shock for us, we are all, my colleagues and employees of the bank and shareholders, quite shocked by this massive fraud, but one has to see that the businesses work quite well despite such a shock," he added, speaking in English. The bank had moved quickly to close gaps in its risk-control armor in the light of the methods Kerviel used to elude his supervisors and run up a 50 billion euro trading exposure which SocGen was forced to wind down last week. "We are looking at additional controls in the coming days and weeks, and significant resources will be mobilized," said Mustier.
