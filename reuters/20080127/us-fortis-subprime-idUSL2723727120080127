 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - Fortis looks set to be under pressure on Monday after a media report that the Belgian-Dutch bank would write down up to 2 billion euros ($2.9 billion) off its subprime portfolio and after its shares fell on talk of profit warnings. 

 So far, Fortis FOR.BRFOR.AS has stuck to the line that it is not aware of any element that could explain the sharp fall of its shares in late trading on Friday and declined to make any comment. Fortis shares in Brussels fell 10.34 percent to 13.26 euros ($19.43) on Friday, their weakest for more than three years. A source that was briefed on the situation said there would be higher than announced write-offs at Fortis but declined to divulge precise figures. Belgian daily De Standaard said on Saturday Fortis would have to write down one or two billion euros, in a report citing "a well-informed source". Financial markets remain nervous after a week that started with plummeting stocks on fears of a U.S. recession and saw both a massive rate cut by the U.S. Federal Reserve and the biggest trading scandal in banking history after a junior trader at France's Societe Generale ( SOGN.PA ) was accused of causing a $7 billion loss. A banking source said Fortis held a board meeting on Friday, which a Fortis spokeswoman declined to confirm. Fortis, which is buying rival ABN AMRO's AAH.AS Dutch operations, saw its third-quarter net profit fall 10 percent in November and warned of subprime-related losses. At the time, its chief financial officer said the bank might take a 120 million euro net charge in the fourth quarter on subprime investments if current conditions continued. Asked whether Fortis would reach its average annual earnings per share growth target of 12 percent in 2007, he said the target was an annual average for the period 2007 through 2011. Fortis is due to present full-year results on March 7. A spokesman for Belgian Finance Minister Didier Reynders said on Friday he was unaware of any problems relating to Fortis.
