 PARIS  (Reuters) - French bank Societe Generale said on Sunday an alleged fraudulent position discovered by the bank last weekend was worth around 50 billion euros ($73.26 billion). 

 The bank announced the fraud on Thursday, accusing a lone, junior trader of creating a mass of positions that cost it 4.9 billion euros in losses. The trader, named by police as 31-year old Jerome Kerviel, is in custody and being questioned over the affair. The bank's statement on Sunday said it started to unwind the trader's positions in an "unfavorable" market from Jan 21. It completed the operation by January 23. The bank said the deals conducted as it unwound the trader's positions accounted for between 5.9 and 8.1 percent of trading volumes in the futures index of Eurostoxx, 5.7 to 7.8 percent of DAX futures traded and up to 3.1 percent of FTSE futures which changed hands. The statement gave a chronology of events since January 18, when it says it discovered an "unusual" trading position. It added that on January 18 the trader's immediate managers were alerted to the problem and they in turn tipped off their supervisors. A team investigated the trader from January 18 to 20. SocGen said in its statement the trader admitted "having set up fictitious operations" and "committed irregularities". He had set up two portfolios, the bank said. Financial instruments held in the first of these appeared to be offset by fictitious deals booked in a second portfolio. This gave the appearance of a "very small residual risk." SocGen said that it had discovered all of the trader's positions by Jan 20. and by the afternoon of Jan 20. it knew what the total exposure was. SocGen also said that following the losses, it would take steps to strengthen its risk control systems. (Reporting by  Sudip Kar-Gupta ; editing by  Crispian Balmer  and Andrew Hurst)
