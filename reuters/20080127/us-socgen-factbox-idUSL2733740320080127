 (Reuters) - This is how Societe Generale alleges a junior trader fooled its risk control systems and ran up fraudulent positions worth 50 billion euros ($73.3 billion), triggering a 4.9 billion euro loss for the bank. 

 The trader has been named as Jerome Kerviel, 31, though his name has not been officially confirmed by the bank. According to SocGen, he had become expert at fooling the bank's systems into thinking there was no market risk on his positions, or net exposure to further fluctuations in prices. Kerviel's family says he has been a scapegoat for the rogue trading scandal. * The trader started at SocGen in the middle office, the department which controls traders' activities, in 2000. * In 2005, he became an arbitrage trader, moving from back to front office in what SocGen's investment banking chief calls a "very unusual" recruitment path for a trader. His experience gave him significant knowledge of the bank's control systems. * His job was to buy and sell similar financial instruments simultaneously, making money only on the tiny and momentary spread in prices between them -- classic arbitrage trading. * He was not allowed to leave the bank with a net exposure. * The alleged fraud, as outlined by the bank, included a genuine long position in regulated stock market index futures, contracts bought in the hope that prices would rise. * Usually an arbitrageur hedges such a long position with an equal and opposite sale, or short position, reaping a profit from any gaps between the values of the two transactions. * The SocGen trader did hedge the first position with a second, but the trades in that portfolio were fake. So the bank was unwittingly holding long futures positions without cover, leaving it exposed to the risk that prices would fall. * To evade controls, for the second portfolio he chose unregulated over-the-counter derivatives which do not need a downpayment, including forward contracts. * Because there was no downpayment, or margin, these trades were not subject to the same immediate checks as the real futures positions held in the first portfolio. * Since the real and fake trades balanced each other out, SocGen says its computers perceived "low residual risk" overall. * As the market turned against him, he sought to cover up mounting losses to avoid further tiers of compliance checks. * The bank alleges that he misappropriated computer passwords and faked documents. To prevent supervisors from uncovering the fictitious positions, he would erase them before the checks and rebuild new ones immediately afterwards. * He ended up with a 50 billion euro portfolio, worth more than the bank itself. This comprised 30 billion euros worth of Eurostoxx pan-European stock index futures contracts, 18 billion on Germany's DAX futures and 2 billion on London's FTSE. * Just one trader was used to close the huge position. The sell-off between January 21-23 generated losses of 4.9 billion euros, making the SocGen scandal the biggest in trading history. How was he caught? * His activities started generating another kind of risk, credit risk, which assesses the strengths of counterparties the bank is dealing with. This induces an army of new checks that the trader was unable to manipulate as easily. * The bank has not accused the trader of profiting from these alleged activities.
