 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Visa said on Monday it had named Joseph Saunders, previously president of card service at Washington Mutual Inc. ( WM.N ), as executive chairman to help lead the company as it goes public. 


 Saunders was previously chief executive at Providian Financial, which Washington Mutual bought. He has also held senior positions at Fleet Credit Card Services and Household International. Washington Mutual said Tony Vuoto would replace Saunders as president of the credit card business. Saunders will help  restructure Visa, including finding board members and naming a new chief executive at the world's largest credit card payment system. The global payments industry is in the middle of rapid change as more consumers embrace debit cards, and new technologies like cell phone payments emerge. "The landscape is changing," Saunders said in an interview. Visa said in October that it planned an initial public offering to fund its expansion and help pay legal costs. At the time, it said it hoped to complete the process within about 12 to 18 months. Saunders will help combine Visa Canada, Visa USA, and Visa International into Visa Inc., the entity that plans to go public.
