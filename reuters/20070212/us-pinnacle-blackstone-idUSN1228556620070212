 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Blackstone Group is expected to buy Pinnacle Foods Corp., owner of Duncan Hines cake mix and Mrs. Paul's frozen fish, for about $1.2 billion, the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday. 


 The deal also includes the assumption of $900 million in debt, the Journal said, citing people familiar with the matter. The current owners of Pinnacle, whose portfolio includes Mrs. Butterworth's pancake syrup, Swanson frozen dinners and Vlasic pickles, are CCMP Capital Advisors, JW Childs Associates and a group of bondholders of the former Aurora Foods, which merged with Pinnacle in 2005 as part of Aurora's bankruptcy reorganization, the paper said.
