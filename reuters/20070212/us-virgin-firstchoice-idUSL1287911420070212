 LONDON  (Reuters) - British airline Virgin Atlantic VA.UL said on Monday it was weighing its options in the package holiday sector after rivals Thomas Cook KARG.DE and MyTravel MT.L announced a merger and dropped interest in a possible bid for First Choice FCD.L. 


 "Virgin Holidays is watching events very carefully," a spokesman for Virgin Atlantic, which runs the business, said. "We're locked in internal meetings to decide what to do from here." A deadline for the first round of bids in the auction for rival firm First Choice FCD.L passed last week. Virgin had expressed interest but did not submit a bid at that time, the spokesman said. Deutsche Bank and Lazard are working with First Choice on the auction.
