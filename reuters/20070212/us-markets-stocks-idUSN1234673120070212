 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Stocks declined on Monday, pressured by a sell-off in energy shares after oil prices dropped and worries that further evidence of weakness in the housing market could hurt consumer spending. 


 Investors also were cautious before comments later this week from Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke. U.S. crude oil CLH7 prices fell more than $2 a barrel after OPEC members Saudi Arabia and Qatar and the cartel's head of research said OPEC may steer away from further supply cuts. The sharp drop in oil prices gave investors an incentive to sell stocks such as Exxon Mobil Corp. ( XOM.N ). The energy sector's losses dragged on both the Dow and the S&P 500. Shares of mortgage bankers, home builders and real estate investment trusts fell for the second day following a statement just before Friday's market close from Countrywide Financial Corp.CFC.N, the top U.S. mortgage lender, which said foreclosures have reached their highest level since 2002. Last week, New Century Financial Corp. NEW.N issued a warning that bad loans in their subprime business would hurt their bottom line. "There is still a bit of hangover from the subprime mortgage news and that has hit some credit-related and financial-related companies," said Rick Meckler, president of investment firm LibertyView Capital Management in Jersey City, New Jersey. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  slipped 28.28 points, or 0.22 percent, to end at 12,552.55. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  declined 4.69 points, or 0.33 percent, to finish at 1,433.37. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  dropped 9.44 points, or 0.38 percent, to close at 2,450.38. U.S. crude oil for March delivery CLH7 fell $2.08 to settle at $57.81 a barrel. Exxon Mobil's stock dropped 0.8 percent, or 62 cents, to $74.60. Shares of Google Inc. ( GOOG.O ) fell 0.8 percent, or $3.60, to $458.29 and were among the top negative factors weighing on the Nasdaq after The Wall Street Journal reported that a group of major media companies has accused the Web search company of benefiting from the sale of pirated movies. Google's stock hit a session low at $455.02, its lowest level so far in 2007. Countrywide shares fell 3.3 percent, or $1.37, to $40.84 and New Century stock dropped 5.5 percent, or $1.01, to $17.21, both on the New York Stock Exchange. The concerns about rising home loan delinquencies also hurt the shares of real estate investment trusts. REITs had been a high-flying sector following private equity firm Blackstone Group's acquisition last week of office landlord Equity Office Properties Trust EOP.N for $23 billion. The MSCI U.S. REIT Index .RMZ2 slid 1.9 percent. Fed Chairman Bernanke's testimony on Capitol Hill is set for Wednesday and Thursday, and investors hope to catch some hint of how he sees the outlook for U.S. interest rates in the months ahead after recent data showing the economy is strong. Shares of Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. ( BMY.N ) fell 3.3 percent, or 93 cents, to $27.59 after a report that the drug maker had ended talks with Sanofi-Aventis ( SASY.PA ) to be acquired by the French company. Trading was moderate on the NYSE, with about 1.32 billion shares changing hands, below last year's estimated daily average of 1.84 billion, while on Nasdaq, about 1.89 billion shares traded, below last year's daily average of 2.02 billion. Declining stocks outnumbered advancing ones by a ratio of about 5 to 3 on the NYSE and by 17 to 13 on Nasdaq. (Additional reporting by  Chris Sanders )
