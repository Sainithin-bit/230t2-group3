 MUMBAI  (Reuters) - Indian businessman Anil Ambani may have lost the multi-billion race to take control of the country's fourth-largest mobile phone company, but the marathon runner is expected to take the setback in stride. 


 Analysts say losing out to British Vodafone's ( VOD.L ) $11.1 billion bid for Hutchison Essar is not the end of the world for Ambani, who is seeking to add the dominant GSM platform to the CDMA operations of his Reliance Communications Ltd. ( RLCM.BO ) in the world's fastest-growing mobile market. The self-confessed fitness fanatic, dubbed "Marathon Man" by the local media, is ranked as the third richest Indian in the world by Forbes magazine after his brother and steel magnate Lakshmi Mittal. Anil is worth $14.8 billion. Since a very public spat with his older brother over control of India's most valuable private company more than two years ago, Ambani has quickly gained a toe-hold in fast-growing areas such as financial services, infrastructure and entertainment. Son of one of India's leading businessmen, Ambani, 47, chose his late father's birthday to announce his interest in Hutchison Essar last December, after weeks of media speculation. "While it (losing the race for Hutchison Essar) does mean that time to market gets delayed, it is not a big negative," said Macquarie in a research note. "An organic build-out of a pan-India GSM network will cost them no more than $3-4 billion," Macquarie said. Ambani, who joined the Reliance group in 1983 as co-chief executive, heads Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group, the parent of Reliance Communications, India's second-largest mobile carrier. Other listed firms are Reliance Capital ( RLCP.BO ), Reliance Energy RLEN.BO and Reliance Natural Resources ( RENR.BO ). Anil was handed control of these assets after his mother stepped in to resolve a bitter row with brother Mukesh, who took control of the flagship Reliance Industries Ltd. ( RELI.BO ), India's biggest private refiner and top petrochemicals maker. It was Mukesh who led the telecoms foray, a move which saw a long-running dispute with other carriers and the government. Their father and Reliance founder Dhirubhai Ambani, a school teacher's son, died in 2002, but his presence looms large, with Anil quoting him at news conferences and business events, and publishing large ads to mark his birth and death anniversaries. Rated as a youth icon in 2003 by an MTV poll, the sharply dressed Ambani is articulate and affable, calling reporters by name at news conferences, where he stands or paces the dais. He belongs to the prosperous Gujarati community, speaking the regional language to shareholders and business associates.

They have two young sons. Ambani also has close links to politicians and was elected as an independent member for a six-year term in the Upper House of Parliament. He resigned his post in March 2006. An early riser, Ambani jogs in the streets near his posh Cuffe Parade apartment in Mumbai every morning, his chauffeur driving slowly behind. He runs the 21-km half-marathon in Mumbai every year. Bearing a striking resemblance to his late father, he is a vegetarian who does not smoke or drink and also practices yoga and meditation. He is also a deeply religious Hindu who is known to visit temples before undertaking a new venture or at the completion of one.
