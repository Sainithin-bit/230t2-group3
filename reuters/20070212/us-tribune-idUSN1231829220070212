 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Newspaper and television company Tribune Co. TRB.N is leaning away from accepting any takeover offers made by outside bidders and instead is opting for a restructuring it would do on its own, the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday. 


 The self-help plan, which comes more than four months after Tribune put itself on the auction block, is widely expected to involve spinning off the company's broadcast division and borrowing money to pay out a one-time cash dividend to shareholders, the paper reported, citing people familiar with the situation. Those same people said Tribune's board is expected to discuss the structure of the plan at a meeting early this week, the Journal reported, noting that a final decision has not yet been made and that it is possible the company will choose a different option.
