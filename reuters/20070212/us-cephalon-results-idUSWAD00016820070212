 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Cephalon Inc. CEPH.O on Monday reported a fourth-quarter loss on debt exchange expense and other one-time charges, but revenue jumped 44 percent on increased sales of its flagship drug for the sleep disorder narcolepsy. 


 The Frazer, Pennsylvania-based biotechnology company posted a net loss of $4.9 million, or 8 cents per share, compared with a net profit of $18.1 million, or 30 cents per share, a year ago when results were hit by acquisition-related costs. Excluding items, Cephalon had adjusted income of $1.06 per share. Analysts on average expected 79 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates.
