 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Pinnacle Foods Corp., the maker of Duncan Hines baking mixes, Vlasic pickles and Aunt Jemima breakfast foods, has agreed to be bought by private equity firm Blackstone Group BG.UL for $1.2 billion, Pinnacle said on Monday. 


 Blackstone will also assume $900 million of Pinnacle debt, raising the value of the deal to $2.16 billion. The deal is a move by Blackstone into "middle-market" territory; the firm is known mainly for its big buyouts, including the $39 billion acquisition of Equity Office Properties Trust. Pinnacle will be handed from one private equity owner to another. Pinnacle is jointly owned by J.W. Childs Associates L.P., CDM Group, and CCMP Capital Advisors, formerly J.P. Morgan Partners. The company is also owned by former bondholders of Aurora Foods Inc., which merged with Pinnacle in 2005 as part of Aurora's bankruptcy reorganization. Roger Deromedi, former Chief Executive at Kraft Foods Inc. KFT.N, will succeed C. Dean Metropoulos as Pinnacle executive chairman on completion of the deal. Pinnacle, which also produces Hungry Man and Swanson frozen dinners, Log Cabin and Mrs. Buttersworth's syrups, Armor canned meat and Lender's bagels, has more than 3,000 employees, owns seven manufacturing facilities in the United States, and generates $2.1 billion in annual gross sales.
