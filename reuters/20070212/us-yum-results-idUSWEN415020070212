 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Fast-food company Yum Brands Inc. ( YUM.N ) on Monday reported a 2.6 percent rise in quarterly earnings as a lower tax rate and strength in China and other international markets offset fallout from an E.Coli outbreak at some Taco Bell restaurants in the United States. 


 Fourth-quarter net income was $232 million, or 83 cents per share, compared with $226 million, or 77 cents per share, a year ago. Wall Street analysts, on average, had been expecting the parent of the KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell chains to earn 79 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue rose 4 percent to $3.02 billion. Analysts were expecting revenue of about $2.89 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. In the United States, sales at company-owned Yum restaurants open at least a year fell 2 percent, led by a drop of 5 percent at Taco Bell. In Yum's fast-growing China business, sales rose 27 percent, and in international markets excluding China, sales were up 10 percent. Yum's businesses outside the United States -- including its robust KFC unit in China -- are the company's biggest growth vehicles and are expected to make up half of its operating profit this year. UBS analyst David Palmer said in a note on Monday that Yum "has increasingly traded on the fortunes of its international businesses." Palmer has a "neutral" rating on the stock. Yum shares closed up 29 cents at $60.78 on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock has gained more than 3 percent since federal health officials declared the Taco Bell E.Coli outbreak over on December 14. That compares with a 0.3 percent decline in the Dow Jones U.S. restaurants and bars index .DJUSRU during the same period.
