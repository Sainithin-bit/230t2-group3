 LONDON  (Reuters) - Shares in the London Stock Exchange eased on Monday after U.S. rival Nasdaq's 2.7 billion pound ($5.3 billion) bid failed. 


 Nasdaq said on Saturday it had won just 0.41 percent of acceptances for its offer for Europe's largest share market which, combined with its existing stake of 28.75 percent, fell well short of the level of just over the 50 percent it needed to take control of the LSE. Shares in the London Stock Exchange, which has seen off four takeover attempts in the last two years, fell 0.9 percent to 1,271 pence by 0834 GMT, having touched 1,262p, but were still ahead of Nasdaq's 1,243p a share offer. "We think that there is imminent downward pressure," said analyst Johannes Thormann at West LB. "At the end, we see some 16 percent fundamental downside to our target price and are thus cutting the LSE's rating to 'reduce'," Thormann added. Other analysts said the shares were likely to hold relatively firm since investors and hedge funds have demonstrated they believe the LSE's future prospects underpin the share price level. Matt Buckland, trader at CMC Markets, said: "Nasdaq's shares are likely to come off as they'd made a big hoohah about getting it." The LSE has said the boom in electronic trading, together with its ability to attract companies from around the globe to list on its exchange in an environment of benign regulation means it is worth considerably more than 1,243p. Speculation now focuses on what Nasdaq intends to do with its stake, which on average -- taking into account the foreign exchange hedge on its investment and the LSE's share buyback -- cost it around 1,100p per share. "There is still the possibility that Nasdaq could dump its 28.75 stake into the market," said Thormann. "Although this threat has been made by CEO Bob Greifeld, we do think that this is very unlikely, because it would at least partly be self-destructive." A combination of the Nasdaq and LSE would have created the world's second transatlantic exchange with a market value of the shares quoted on it of $11.8 trillion. Under UK takeover rules Nasdaq cannot bid for another 12 months. (Additional reporting by Sitaraman Shankar)
