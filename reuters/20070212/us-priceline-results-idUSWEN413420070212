 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Online travel company Priceline.com Inc. ( PCLN.O ) said on Monday its quarterly profit rose sharply on higher travel bookings, helped by strength in its European business. 


 The Norwalk, Connecticut-based company said its fourth-quarter net income was $13.2 million, or 33 cents per share, up from $3.8 million, or 9 cents per share, a year earlier.
