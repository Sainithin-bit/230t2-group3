 SYDNEY  (Reuters) - Australian newspaper publisher John Fairfax Holdings Ltd. ( FXJ.AX ) said its first-half net profit fell 2.7 percent amid tough conditions in some markets and as it made acquisitions to deter potential predators. 


 Fairfax is considered a takeover target as media ownership rules ease this year, and it bid A$2.8 billion for regional media group Rural Press RUP.AX last year in a bid to strengthen itself against possible bids. Fairfax Chief Executive David Kirk told reporters on Monday the company had not received any approaches. "Completion of the proposed merger with Rural Press will greatly strengthen Fairfax Media and its future, reinforcing our position as Australasia's largest media company," Chairman Ronald Walker said in a statement. Kirk told reporters he was confident of concluding the deal by May. Fairfax posted July-December net profit before non-recurring items of A$121.4 million ($94.1 million), down from A$124.8 million a year earlier, but beating an average forecast of A$114 million from three analysts. "The reality is the group is now starting to see the benefit of diversification away from the traditional metropolitan (newspaper) markets in Sydney and Melbourne, and online is the most critical part of that," said BT Financial Group analyst Jack Chemello. The digital business had strong growth, especially the Trade Me auction Web site in New Zealand, he added. Fairfax shares were off 0.8 percent at A$4.99 by 0115 GMT. Kirk declined to reaffirm a November forecast for earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) to pick-up in the second half, but tipped strong growth in its digital business. Net profit including one-off items was up 18.6 percent to A$142.2 million, including A$13.2 million from the sale of its shareholding in Web site carsales.com.au. The company said the result reflected improved trading conditions in Victoria, but a weak New South Wales economy. Advertising conditions in the two Australian states were relatively weak, Kirk said. Costs rose following the impact of its acquisition of The Border Mail and The Independent Group in Victoria. Fairfax, with its open share register, had been seen as one of the most likely takeover targets when new laws come into force later this year allowing owners of one media platform -- newspapers, television or radio -- to own another in a single market. Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. NWS.N bought a 7.5 percent stake in Fairfax in October, while broadcaster Seven Network Ltd. SEV.AX in December bought a stake of less than 5 percent. Earlier on Monday, APN News and Media ( APN.AX ), which owns New Zealand's largest newspaper and a string of radio stations, agreed to a revised A$2.8 billion ($2.2 billion) offer from a consortium including Tony O'Reilly's Independent News and Media Plc.
