 SYDNEY  (Reuters) - Australia's APN News and Media ( APN.AX ) on Monday agreed to a revised A$2.8 billion ($2.2 billion) offer from a consortium including Tony O'Reilly's Independent News and Media Plc. INWS.I. 


 APN, which owns New Zealand's largest newspaper and a string of radio stations, is the latest Australian media firm to be targeted by private equity ahead of a shakeup of the nation's media ownership laws. Independent and private equity heavyweights Carlyle Group CYL.UL and Providence Equity Partners raised their offer to A$6.10 per share, up from last month's A$6.05, following negotiations with APN. Ausbil Dexia Chief Executive Paul Xiradis said the revised bid fell within the range the market was expecting. "I don't think there were high expectations that there would be a substantially higher bid," said Xiradis, adding there didn't seem to be any rival bidders to top the revised Independent bid. Dublin-based Independent, which publishes 175 newspaper and magazine titles across the globe, will reduce its stake in APN to 35 percent from 42 percent, APN said, confirming an earlier Reuters report. Carlyle will hold 27.5 percent and Providence 37.5 percent. Independent chairman Tony O'Reilly, a former international rugby player and Ireland's best-known businessman, and the other members of the consortium struck the deal with APN's independent directors following talks over the past two weeks. "After negotiating the increase from the initial proposal of A$6.02 per share to a final offer of A$6.10, the independent committee has formed the view that the increased offer is in the shareholders' best interests and we recommend all shareholders vote in favor of the proposal," Ted Harris, chairman of APN's independent committee, said in a statement. Previous talks ended in November after Independent made a joint approach with Providence at A$6.02 per share. Carlyle joined the consortium shortly afterwards to work on another bid. The deal values APN at A$3.8 billion when including its debt and convertible notes. It values APN at 13 times attributable 2006 earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), APN said. APN, which reports full-year earnings on February 20, said it expected 2006 EBITDA to be A$348 million, or A$292 million excluding the impact of minority interests. It said it expected 2006 earnings per share will rise more than 5 percent, in line with previous guidance. Kohlberg Kravis Roberts KKR.UL set up a A$4 billion joint venture with Seven Network Ltd.'s SEV.AX media businesses last year, while Publishing & Broadcasting Ltd. PBL.AX tipped its media assets into a joint venture with CVC Asia Pacific. (Additional reporting by  Victoria Thieberger )
