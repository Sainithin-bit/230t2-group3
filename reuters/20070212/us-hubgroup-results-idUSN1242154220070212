 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Transportation management company Hub Group Inc. ( HUBG.O ) said on Monday its quarterly net profit rose, citing higher freight revenue in its truck brokerage and intermodal services. 


 Fourth-quarter net income rose to $13.5 million, or 34 cents a share, from $10.1 million, or 25 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 5.5 percent to $425.5 million. Analysts had, on average, predicted earnings per share for the quarter of 32 cents, according to Reuters Estimates.

The Downers Grove, Illinois-based company also said it was "comfortable" that 2007 earnings per share would be within the current analysts' range of $1.25 to $1.40.
