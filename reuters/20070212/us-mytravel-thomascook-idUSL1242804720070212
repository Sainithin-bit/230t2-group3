 LONDON/DUESSELDORF, Germany  (Reuters) - German-owned Thomas Cook is to buy British package holiday rival MyTravel MT.L, the companies said on Monday, creating a travel company worth about 2.8 billion pounds ($5.5 billion). 


 Thomas Cook, which is owned by stores group KarstadtQuelle KARG.DE, will hold 52 percent of the new company and MyTravel's shareholders will control 48 percent. It will be called Thomas Cook Group Plc will take around 19 million people a year on holiday. MyTravel Chief Executive Peter McHugh said the deal would create a company with annual revenue of around 8 billion pounds ($15.58 billion) and close the gap on Europe's biggest travel operator TUI AG ( TUIGn.DE ) which has sales of around $23 billion. The deal is due to be completed by June. The new firm, to be headquartered in London and listed on the London Stock Exchange, would be worth around 2.8 billion pounds following a sharp jump in MyTravel shares on Monday. Because of the merger the companies said they had ditched plans to take over the mainstream package holiday business of British competitor First Choice FCD.L. MyTravel shares jumped more than 30 percent to a record 317-1/2 pence before easing to 302-1/2p, while KarstadtQuelle rose almost 3.5 percent to 27.11 euros. Shares in First Choice fell 14 percent to 262-1/2 by 1130  GMT. "MyTravel shareholders will benefit from a 48 percent share of synergy, an injection of new management, and an improved strategy," analysts at ABN Amro said. COST SAVINGS The package holiday industry has declined as more people put together their own trips using the Internet and low-cost airlines. Companies are trying to counter this with cost savings and by branching into leisure markets such as cruises. MyTravel and Thomas Cook said they expected to make cost savings of 75 million pounds ($146.1 million) a year after combining the two businesses. "We think it will take 24 to 30 months to achieve the forecast," McHugh said. McHugh said the bulk of any job losses would be in Britain as the company closes high street stores and eliminates duplicated administrative roles. "There certainly will be some job cuts but it's premature to say how many," he said. MyTravel has 12,947 employees, and Thomas Cook has 19,775. The two groups have 1,030 shops in Britain, with 18,781 staff. "The major focus (of job losses) will be in the UK," said Thomas Cook Chief Executive Manny Fontenla-Novoa, who will be chief executive of the new company after working alongside McHugh. Thomas Middelhoff, KarstadtQuelle's chief executive and chairman of Thomas Cook, will chair the new company, and MyTravel Chairman Michael Beckett will be deputy. Formerly known as Airtours, MyTravel almost collapsed under the weight of its debt in 2003 when leisure markets turned down. The company, which runs Going Places travel agents, has cut costs, closed shops and reduced the number of holidays it sells. It reported a pretax profit of 43.8 million pounds ($86.3 million) in the year ended October 31. Thomas Cook also returned to profit for the first time in four years last year after it slashed jobs and costs. In December, KarstadtQuelle said it would buy the half of Thomas Cook it did not own from Deutsche Lufthansa ( LHAG.DE ) for 800 million euros. UBS, Credit Suisse and Tricorn Partners advised MyTravel while Goldman Sachs advised KarstadtQuelle and Citigroup advised Thomas Cook.
