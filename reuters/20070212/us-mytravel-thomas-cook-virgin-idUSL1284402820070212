 LONDON  (Reuters) - British airline Virgin Atlantic VA.UL said it was weighing its options in the package holiday sector after Thomas Cook KARG.DE agreed to buy rival MyTravel MT.L on Monday. 


 "Virgin Holidays is watching events very carefully," a spokesman for Virgin Atlantic, which runs the business, said. "We're locked in internal meetings to decide what to do from here." The Thomas Cook-MyTravel deal comes just days after a call for first-round bids for rival UK firm First Choice FCD.L passed without Virgin taking part. "We did not submit a bid...we did have talks," the Virgin spokesman said. Deutsche Bank and Lazard are working with First Choice on the auction. First Choice shares plummeted on Monday after possible suitors Thomas Cook and MyTravel opted to merge instead of making a play for First Choice. "No we are not (continuing talks with First Choice)," MyTravel Chief Executive Peter McHugh told reporters during a conference call on Monday. First Choice shares were down 13.4 percent at 264-1/4 pence at 1340 GMT, after hitting a low of 245-1/4p. At its Friday close of 305-1/4p, First Choice had a market capitalization of 1.6 billion pounds. The holidays sector is suffering from oversupply, prompting top players to look at mergers to cut costs and squeeze rivals. Virgin Holidays is a top player in long-haul package holidays. The business accounted for revenues of 426 million pounds ($828.8 million) last year, or about a quarter of Virgin Atlantic's total.
