 TORONTO  (Reuters) - Four Seasons Hotels Inc. FSH.TO FS.N said on Monday it has agreed to a $3.37 billion offer to be taken private by a group that includes the Canadian company's chief executive as well as Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal and Microsoft Corp. ( MSFT.O ) Chairman Bill Gates. 


 Four Seasons said the transaction was approved unanimously by its board following a report and recommendation by a panel of independent directors. A shareholders meeting to vote on the deal is expected in April, the company said. The transaction will require approval by two-thirds of the votes cast by holders of limited voting shares. Last November, Prince Alwaleed's Kingdom Hotels International and Gates' Cascade Investment LLC. offered $82 in cash for each limited voting share, a bid that values Four Seasons at $3.8 billion including debt, the company said. The equity portion of the deal is valued at $3.37 billion, based on 41.1 million outstanding limited and variable multiple voting shares, although Prince Alwaleed already has a 23-percent stake in Four Seasons, while Cascade has 8.2-percent of the company. "Given the recent trading activity, we believe some investors may be disappointed, however we believe this offer is good value," UBS analyst William Truelove said in a research note. Shares of Four Seasons were down $2.60, or 3.1 percent, at $81.28 in New York on Monday, and down C$2.75, or 2.8 percent, at C$95.48 on the Toronto Stock Exchange. The stock traded as high as $84.25 in New York on Friday. This is the Saudi billionaire's second foray into the Canadian hotel segment since 2005. In January 2006, his Kingdom Hotels joined forces with a U.S investment group to buy another luxury chain, Fairmont Hotels & Resorts, for $3.9 billion. If the deal goes through, founder, chairman and chief executive Isadore Sharp and his family holding company, Triples Holdings Ltd., will have a 10-percent stake of the hotel chain, with the remaining shares split equally between Kingdom and Cascade. Sharp will also gain $288 million from the deal. ($1=$1.17 Canadian)
