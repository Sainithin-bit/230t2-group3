 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Loews Corp. LTR.N, the conglomerate run by the Tisch family, reported a nearly six-fold increase in fourth-quarter profit on Monday, helped by gains at its insurance and oil drilling units. 


 Results were bolstered as Loews' CNA Financial Corp. ( CNA.N ) insurance unit swung to a profit from a year-earlier loss, while profit doubled at Loews' Diamond Offshore Drilling Inc. ( DO.N ) unit. Loews Chief Executive James Tisch said CNA has made "great progress" in reducing risk and generating more consistent results, while Diamond Offshore benefited from increased demand for deepwater and mid-water drilling. Net income at New York-based Loews, whose businesses include financial, tobacco, energy, hotel and watch-making companies, rose to $746.5 million from $127.6 million a year earlier. Profit attributable to Loews shareholders rose to $609.4 million, or $1.11 per share, from $46 million, or 8 cents. Excluding investment gains, profit totaled 98 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates, 3 cents above the average analyst forecast. Revenue rose 19 percent to $4.88 billion. Tisch said Loews ended the quarter with $5.3 billion of cash, and would consider acquisitions if the "right opportunity" arises. Loews shares rose as much as 3.2 percent. Chicago-based CNA, the No. 7 U.S. commercial insurer and Loews' largest unit, reported a profit of $329 million, or $1.22 per share. That compared with a loss of $217 million, or 92 cents per share, a year earlier, when CNA exited several reinsurance contracts and faced claims from Hurricanes Katrina, Dennis, Ophelia, Rita and Wilma. Loews owns 89 percent of CNA. Excluding investment gains, CNA operating profit totaled 92 cents per share, 9 cents below the average forecast. CNA used 99 percent of property and casualty premium income for claims, down from 121.4 percent. "The weather cooperated," CNA Chief Executive Stephen Lilienthal said on a conference call. Houston-based Diamond Offshore last Thursday reported a quarterly profit of $221.4 million, or $1.60 per share. Loews has a 54 percent stake in the unit, which is also led by James Tisch. CIGARETTE SALES RISE Net income at Carolina Group CG.N, a tracking stock for the Lorillard Inc. tobacco unit, rose 15 percent to $220 million. Profit attributable to Carolina shareholders was $1.26 per share, up from $1.11. Analysts expected $1.13. Lorillard net sales rose 2 percent to $936.7 million. Excluding excise taxes, sales totaled $764.6 million. Chief Executive Martin Orlowsky said Lorillard was the only major U.S. tobacco company to boost market share and shipments in 2006. Lorillard brands include Newport, Kent and True. Profit fell 3 percent at Boardwalk Pipeline Partners LP ( BWP.N ), in which Loews owns an 80 percent stake, while Loews Hotels posted a $3.8 million profit. Loews also owns watchmaker Bulova Corp. Loews is run by James Tisch and Co-Chairmen Andrew Tisch and Jonathan Tisch. Andrew and James Tisch's late father, Laurence Tisch, and Jonathan Tisch's late father, Preston Robert Tisch, were also Loews chairmen. In afternoon trading, Loews shares were up 77 cents at $43.61, after earlier rising to $44.20. CNA fell 8 cents to $41.76, and Carolina fell 8 cents to $68.00 (Additional reporting by  Brad Dorfman  in Chicago and  Christian Plumb  in New York)
