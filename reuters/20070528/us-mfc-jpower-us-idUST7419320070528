 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Electric Power Development Co. (J-Power) ( 9513.T ) will form a joint venture in the United States with a life insurer to help raise its power-generation assets there by up to 2,000 megawatts by 2010 from the current 600 MW. 

 The Japanese electricity wholesaler said on Monday it and John Hancock Life Insurance Co., the U.S. unit of Toronto-based Manulife Financial Corp. (MFC) ( MFC.TO ), will form an equally owned joint venture in the United States. MFC is a leading investor in the U.S. power industry, with a $7 billion portfolio spread across more than 200 power companies. "The joint venture is part of a plan to strengthen our power generation business abroad, particularly in the United States, where business risk is relatively small," a J-Power spokesman said. J-Power said it aims to add 1,000 MW to 2,000 MW to its net power-generation assets in North America by 2010 by buying existing assets through the joint venture, to be called J-Power USA Generation L.P. The company will initially have 600 MW of net generation ownership by taking over the Japanese power utility's current assets there. J-Power is fighting calls from British activist hedge fund TCI to more than triple its year-end dividend payment to 100 yen against the company's plan for a 30 yen payment. With a 9.9 percent stake, TCI is J-Power's top shareholder.
