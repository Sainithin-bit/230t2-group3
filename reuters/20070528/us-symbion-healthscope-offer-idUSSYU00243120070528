 SYDNEY  (Reuters) - Australian medical services firm Symbion Health Ltd. SYB.AX said on Tuesday it would allow three weeks for rival proposals to A$2.86 billion ($2.34 billion) takeover offer from its smaller rival Healthscope Ltd. HSP.AX. 

 Drugs company Sigma Pharmaceuticals Ltd. ( SIP.AX ) said last week it had spoken to banks and would decide whether to launch a rival offer for takeover target Symbion Health in the next few weeks. Symbion Chief Executive Robert Cooke said Sigma had made some approaches in recent days. "We've allowed three weeks for a superior proposal to emerge so we're very conscious of transparency to make sure that we maximize shareholder value for pharmacy and consumer," Cooke told reporters. "But it needs to be a serious offer and, obviously, a superior offer, and that's a question that you need to ask Sigma," he said. ($1=A$1.22)
