 TORONTO  (Reuters) - Norsk Hydro ASA ( NHY.OL ) is mulling a 
bid for Alcan Inc. AL.TO, adding another player to the fray 
eyeing the Canadian aluminum producer, a Canadian national 
newspaper said on Monday. 

  The Globe and Mail, citing investment bankers working with 
two other companies, said the Norwegian state-backed company 
has begun work on a bid worth more than $30 billion.  "There are advantages," one banker close to Alcan told the 
paper. "Obviously there are synergies there and there are 
certain similarities in terms of potential desires by 
governments. It has interesting potential."  Norsk is 43 percent owned by the Norwegian government.  The paper said if Norsk does bid, it could tap into the 
government's pension fund which is valued at about $292 
billion.  A separate report on Monday said Rio Tinto Ltd. ( RIO.AX ) 
( RIO.L ) had hired Deutsche Bank to advise it on a possible bid 
for the Canadian aluminum producer.  Last week Alcan rejected Alcoa's ( AA.N ) $28.4-billion 
takeover bid and said it was in talks with third parties.  ($1=$1.08 Canadian)
