 PHILADELPHIA  (Reuters) - Oil and gas producer Pogo Producing Co. ( PPP.N ) said on Monday it would sell its Northrock Resources Ltd. subsidiary for $2 billion in cash to Abu Dhabi National Energy Co. TAQA.AD and would continue to explore other strategic options, including the sale of the company. 

 Northrock, which includes properties located largely in Alberta, Saskatchewan and the Northwest Territories of Canada, produces about 29,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. It had about 706 estimated proven reserves as of December 31. The deal is expected to close in the third quarter. Pogo said Goldman Sachs Group and TD Securities Inc. would continue to serve as its financial advisers as it explores other strategic options. Pogo recently has sold other non-core assets and exited from the Gulf of Mexico. After the closing of the Northrock deal, Pogo would have sold about 900 billion cubic feet equivalent of proven for a total of $2.6 billion, the company said. The various divestitures will help Pogo reduce debt and related interest expense and cut administrative costs, the company said. Abu Dhabi National Energy -- known as Taqa -- said the purchase of Northrock would serve as a base for further investments and growth in Canada. In March, Taqa said it planned to buy $6 billion of assets this year. The company, which is 75 percent-owned by the Abu Dhabi government, said it would look at acquisitions of wind power assets, as well as investments in Indian hydro-electric power generation and liquefied natural gas projects.
