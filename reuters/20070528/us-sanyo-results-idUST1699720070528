 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Sanyo Electric Co. Ltd. 6764.T posted a swing to an annual operating profit after cost cuts more than offset slow digital camera sales, but forecast an unexpected earnings decline this year due to higher raw material prices. 

 Sanyo, the world's largest rechargeable battery maker which competes with smaller rivals including Sony Corp. ( 6758.T ), enjoyed strong solar cell demand, but its digital camera operations were hit by fierce competition with established brands such as Canon Inc. ( 7751.T ) as well as emerging Asian suppliers. The Osaka-based company on Monday forecast a 9.2 percent fall in operating profit to 45 billion yen ($370 million) for the year to March 2008 due to rising prices for raw materials it uses in rechargeable batteries, such as nickel and cobalt. That would fall short of a consensus of 51 billion yen in a poll of 10 analysts by Reuters Estimates. "Runaway materials prices in our core rechargeable battery and solar cell operations have a big impact on earnings," Sanyo President Seiichiro Sano told a news conference. "We are naturally taking a tough stance in price negotiations. But this still is a factor that drives down our profit considerably." Cobalt prices hit 11-year highs in April due to growing demand for rechargeable batteries for personal computers, digital cameras, mobile phones and portable music players. At the net level, Sanyo expects its first annual profit in 4 years in the current business year. The company forecast a net profit of 20 billion yen for the year to March, against a loss of 45.36 billion yen a year earlier, when its bottom line was weighed down by restructuring charges. Sano, who replaced Toshimasa Iue, the grandson of the company's founder, in April as president, also said he aims to draw up a preliminary midterm business plan by September. In the year ended March 31, Sanyo's operating profit totaled 49.57 billion yen, turning around from a 17.15 billion yen loss a year earlier. Sales slid 7.6 percent to 2.215 trillion yen. Sanyo's earnings have been hit hard in recent years by the cost of restructuring steps such as job cuts and plant closures, as well as by earthquake damage to its microchip factory, forcing it to issue $2.5 billion worth of preferred shares to Goldman Sachs ( GS.N ) and two other financial institutions last year. Prior to the announcement, shares in Sanyo closed up 3.2 percent 193 yen, outperforming the Tokyo stock market's electrical machinery index .IELEC.T, which rose 0.7 percent. Sanyo shares have lost more than one-third of their value during the previous business year, while the subindex gained 0.5 percent. (Additional reporting by Aiko Wakao)
