 SYDNEY  (Reuters) - Australia's Healthscope Ltd. HSP.AX launched a A$2.86 billion ($2.34 billion) takeover offer for larger rival Symbion Health Ltd. SYB.AX on Tuesday, backed by private equity firms Ironbridge Capital and Archer Capital. 

 Healthscope said the cash and share offer valued Symbion at about A$4.42 per Symbion share. Symbion shares closed on Monday at A$4.39. Healthscope said Symbion had backed the deal, and it expected to achieve cost synergies of A$79 million a year by the end of the third full year after the deal. Symbion said earlier in May it had received a takeover approach from Healthscope Ltd. SYB.AX that valued the pathology company's ordinary shares at A$2.78 billion. ($1=A$1.22)
