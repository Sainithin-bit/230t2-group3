 SINGAPORE  (Reuters) - Asia-focused Standard Chartered ( STAN.L ) will hire 200 to 300 private bankers worldwide over the next two to three years to boost its new wealth management business, a senior executive said on Monday. 

 Peter Flavel, global head of its private bank, told a news conference that the bank's headcount in private wealth management should reach between 350 and 450 by the year 2010. Standard Chartered ( 2888.HK ) and other banks are increasingly focusing on the private banking business because of the rapid rise in the number of wealthy individuals, particularly in Asia. The sector is dominated by big international players, including UBS ( UBSN.VX ), Citigroup ( C.N ), and HSBC ( HSBA.L ). Flavel was speaking at the launch of Standard Chartered's global private banking headquarters in Singapore.
