 PHILADELPHIA  (Reuters) - Telecommunications equipment maker Avaya Inc. ( AV.N ) is in talks with private equity and strategic bidders about selling all or part of the company, according to a report by The Wall Street Journal. 

 Avaya, which has a market capitalization of more than $6.1 billion, is in talks with private equity firm Silver Lake Partners about a leveraged buyout, according to the report. Avaya also has held recent talks with rival Nortel Networks Corp. NT.TO NT.N about a possible deal, but the two sides failed to agree on a price or on whether Nortel would use cash or stock to fund the deal, according to the report. Avaya and Nortel are still in contact, however, and a deal could materialize, the WSJ said. Avaya could not be immediately reached for comment. Nortel and Silver Lake declined to comment.
