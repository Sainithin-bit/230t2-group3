 SINGAPORE  (Reuters) - Standard Chartered ( STAN.L ) ( 2888.HK ) 
is planning to return to retail stockbroking in Asia for the 
first time in more than a decade with a proposal to buy a 
brokerage network in India, the Financial Times reported on 
Monday. 

  The UK-based emerging markets bank is in exclusive talks 
with Securities Trading Corporation of India to buy an initial 
49 per cent stake in India's UTI Securities for about 1.4 
billion rupees ($35 million), the paper said, quoting people 
familiar with the deal.  News of the deal was first reported by India's Economic 
Times two weeks ago.  The deal, designed to complement Standard Chartered's 
wealth management business in India, was expected to be sealed 
within the next few months.  Standard Chartered has signed a memorandum of understanding 
with STCI to acquire UTI Securities, a former arm of the 
state-owned financial group of the same name, and was 
conducting a final round of due diligence, the FT reported.  Under the deal, it will buy 49 per cent of UTI Securities 
now, before increasing its stake to 74 per cent next year and 
taking full control in 2009. The brokerage has 170 branches 
across the country.
