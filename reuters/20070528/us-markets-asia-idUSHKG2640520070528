 HONG KONG  (Reuters) - Asian stock markets rebounded on Monday, with South Korea reaching a new peak as gains on Wall Street helped soothe worries about overheating in China's red-hot share markets. 

 Takeover news, such as Nasdaq's ( NDAQ.O ) plan to buy Nordic exchange company OMX OMX.ST, had helped lift optimism on Wall Street Friday, driving the blue-chip Dow  .DJI  and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  higher. At 0021 GMT, Tokyo's Nikkei average  .N225  had climbed 0.5 percent as Sony ( 6758.T ) gained 0.7 percent, auto maker Honda Motor ( 7267.T ) also added 0.7 percent and photo film maker Fuji Film Holdings ( 4901.T ) rose 1.4 percent. "Stocks here are likely to see a rebound after the gain in U.S. markets and as the yen remains in the region of 121 yen to the dollar," said Yutaka Miura, a senior technical strategist at Shinko Securities. A weak yen is good for exporters as it boosts the value of their overseas sales. In South Korea, the benchmark KOSPI  .KS11  rose nearly 0.5 percent to touch a new high of 1,652.05, recovering from Friday's 0.1 percent fall, thanks to strength in top lender Kookmin Bank 060000.KS and Shinhan Financial Group ( 055550.KS ). "Global markets are still doing well, and that's encouraging investors to buy stocks every time there are falls," said Kim Hak-kyun, an analyst at Korea Investment and Securities. Australia's key S&P/ASX 200 index .AXJO advanced 0.6 percent, underpinned by gains of a 1.6 percent for mining giant BHP Billiton ( BHP.AX ) and 2.5 percent for fellow global miner Rio Tinto ( RIO.AX ) on a rally in metals prices. But Coles CGJ.AX eased 0.4 percent after global private equity group CVC CVC.UL pulled out of a consortium eyeing a bid for the retailer after going through its books. MSCI's measure of Asia Pacific stocks excluding Japan .MSCIAPJ put on 0.3 percent, rebounding after two-straight sessions of declines.
