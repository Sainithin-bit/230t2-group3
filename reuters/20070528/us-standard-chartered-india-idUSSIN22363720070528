 SINGAPORE  (Reuters) - Asia-focused Standard Chartered Plc. ( STAN.L ) ( 2888.HK ) is in final talks to buy a 49 percent stake in Indian brokerage UTI Securities, the latest bank to buy into the country's hot brokerage sector. 

 The deal would help Standard Chartered expand its services for wealthy customers in India, a fast-growing private banking market, by offering stock brokerage. The Financial Times reported on Monday that the 1.4 billion rupee ($35 million) purchase in UTI -- which has about 40 branches and 700 million rupees in annual revenue-- marked Standard Chartered's return to retail stock broking in Asia after more than a decade. "The UTI transaction is in final due diligence," Peter Flavel, Standard Chartered's global head of private banking, said in Singapore, adding the bank wants to eventually increase its stake in the Indian securities broker to 70 percent. G. Narayanan, managing director at Securities Trading Corp. of India Ltd., UTI's parent, confirmed the talks were advanced, but declined to discuss the value of the deal. "We want to have a strategic partner to scale up the value of the company and to have a global reach," Narayanan told Reuters in Mumbai. "That is why we have chosen a partner who has a strong capability and presence in India, that is the way it suits us." Standard Chartered joins a clutch of foreign players, including Citigroup ( C.N ), Merrill Lynch MER.N and BNP Paribas ( BNPP.PA ) that have invested in India's fast-growth brokerage sector as the stock market booms. India's main stock index  .BSESN  rose 73 percent in 2003, 13 percent in 2004, 42 percent in 2005 and 47 percent in 2006. At the end of last week, it was up 4 percent so far this year, but is 2.6 percent below its record high of 14,723.88, hit on February 9. WEALTH MANAGEMENT Flavel, speaking at the launch of Standard Chartered's private banking services, said its existing wealth management business -- catering to individuals with investable assets of below $1 million -- is growing strongly. It contributed nearly $2 billion in revenue last year, or 40 percent of consumer banking business. The new private banking business, which is headquartered in Singapore, caters to customers with $1 million to $50 million. As part of its expansion, Flavel said Standard Chartered would hire 200-300 private bankers worldwide over the next 2-3 years, bringing the total to 350-450 by 2010. He did not say how much the bank would invest in its private banking business, but said it would be "materially accretive" to the bank's earnings by 2009 after two years of investment. Standard Chartered and other banks are increasingly focusing on the private banking business because of the rapid rise in the number of wealthy individuals, particularly in Asia. At end-2005, India had 83,000 millionaires, according to a Capgemini Merrill Lynch survey, with combined wealth of $290 billion. The sector is dominated by big international players, including UBS ( UBSN.VX ), Citigroup, and HSBC ( HSBA.L ). (Additional reporting by Hiral Vora in MUMBAI)
