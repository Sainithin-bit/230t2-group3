 SYDNEY/ MELBOURNE  (Reuters) - Private equity giants Kohlberg Kravis Roberts KKR.UL and CVC CVC.UL pulled out of a consortium eyeing Australia's Coles Group Ltd. CGJ.AX, but the bid group said it was still in the race for the retailer. 

 KKR confirmed late on Monday it had withdrawn from the consortium due to concerns about the health of some of Coles' businesses following two weeks of due diligence, hours after CVC said it was dropping out. "Maybe CVC pulled out because they saw the price towards the upper limit of what they were prepared to accept, given the aggressive stance that Wesfarmers has taken," Holst & Co. analyst David Spry said earlier, referring to an existing bid from Australian conglomerate Wesfarmers WES.AX. "They do have a pretty formidable competitor and maybe they see it being a bit risky at this price level," he said. Wesfarmers has already offered A$19.7 billion ($16.2 billion) for Coles, or A$16.47 per share, and amassed a 12.8 percent voting stake. Coles shares are trading about 50 percent higher than before KKR's initial bid for the retailer first emerged in August last year. Coles rejected that bid. "I can confirm that KKR has joined CVC in withdrawing," a spokesman for the consortium told Reuters. The spokesman could not rule out further changes to the group interested in buying all or parts of the retailer, which put itself up for sale in February. Analysts and a source familiar with the situation said other members of the group still had plenty of financial firepower to pursue its bid even without CVC and KKR. Coles shares closed down 0.4 percent at A$17.38, while Wesfarmers ended off 0.3 percent at A$37.79. The bid group had finished an exclusive two-week stint examining Coles' books on Friday, but they are continuing due diligence. This included access to detailed financials, lease arrangements and supply contracts. The KKR group also includes Bain, Blackstone Group BG.UL, Carlyle Group CYL.UL and TPG TPG.UL. Rival retailer Woolworths Ltd. ( WOW.AX ) is also eyeing some Coles assets but has not yet decided whether to team up with the KKR group, sources have said. Wesfarmers started due diligence on May 25 and attended management presentations on Monday on the Officeworks business supplies chain and discount retailer Target. The presentations will continue on Tuesday, focusing on the core food and liquor business. Wesfarmers has teamed up with Macquarie Bank Ltd. MBL.AX and private equity groups Permira and Pacific Equity Partners. Wesfarmers tried to raise its stake in Coles with a higher A$17.25 offer price earlier in May, which would have valued the company at A$20.6 billion, but was rebuffed by institutional holders. Because investors who accept shares can get capital gains tax relief, Wesfarmers is seen as having an advantage of more than A$1 a share over a straight cash bid by KKR. Analysts have said the KKR group would need to offer at least A$18.50 to match a possible Wesfarmers offer of A$17.25 for retail shareholders to receive the same benefit. British retailer Tesco Plc ( TSCO.L ) also hired an investment bank to look at a possible approach but later pulled out of the race. Coles has said it will accept final bids for the company in the week beginning June 25, after reporting soft quarterly sales that failed to keep pace with inflation in its core supermarkets and liquor business.
