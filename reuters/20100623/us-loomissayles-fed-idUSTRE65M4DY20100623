 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A leading U.S. bond manager said on Wednesday the Federal Reserve is unlikely to raise rates before the fall of 2011 because an economic recovery still appears sluggish. 

 Dan Fuss, who as vice chairman at Loomis Sayles helps oversee $145 billion in assets, said in an interview the U.S. central bank could "tinker" with its statement due later on Wednesday after its policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee meeting, but with no drastic change. The statement is due at 2:15 p.m. (1815 GMT) (Editing by Kenneth Barry)
