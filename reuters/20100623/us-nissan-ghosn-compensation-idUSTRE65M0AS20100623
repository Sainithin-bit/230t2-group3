 YOKOHAMA, Japan  (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Chief Executive Carlos Ghosn said his total compensation last business year was $9.5 million, making him one of the highest-paid executives at a Japanese company. 

 The Brazilian-born Frenchman made another 1.24 million euros ($1.5 million) at Nissan's French partner, Renault, which he also heads, in 2009. That was less than half his remuneration in 2008, as poor business results and an economic crisis capped performance-based, variable pay. The size of the dual Renault-Nissan CEO's pay package has been keenly awaited since new corporate disclosure rules are forcing Japanese companies to reveal what they pay executives if they receive more than 100 million yen starting this year. Previously, public companies were only required to disclose what executives received as a group. Ghosn has repeatedly defended Nissan's pay scale -- off the charts compared with domestic rivals -- as being globally competitive and necessary to attract talent in a global industry. Addressing the issue at an annual shareholders' meeting on Wednesday, Ghosn said Nissan retains an external firm to benchmark executive pay against its peers. He noted that the highest-paid executive at a global automaker made $17.4 million last year. According to consultancy Towers Watson, Ford Motor CEO Alan Mulally was tops with $17.4 million, followed by Fiat boss Sergio Marchionne's $14 million. The average pay of CEOs at Volkswagen, Ford, Fiat and Daimler was $11.7 million. Executives at other Japanese car makers make far less. In the business year ended March 2010, Toyota Motor's 38 directors made 37.5 million yen ($414,300) each on average, while Honda Motor's got around 50 million yen. Nissan paid an average 169 million yen each to its 10 in-house directors. Unlike Toyota President Akio Toyoda or Honda CEO Takanobu Ito, Ghosn is an external hire, sent by top shareholder Renault to Nissan in 1999 to rescue it from the brink. A company insider said he has been offered jobs by four rivals -- Ford, General Motors, Fiat and Chrysler -- over the last 11 years. Ghosn is also a director of aluminum giant Alcoa Inc and Russian carmaker AvtoVAZ. Last week, Sony Corp CEO Howard Stringer became one of the first executives at a Japanese firm to have his remuneration made public, with a pay package of $4.5 million plus stock options in the past year.
