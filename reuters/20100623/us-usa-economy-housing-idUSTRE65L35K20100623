 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Where is the housing market headed? The U.S. Labor Department may hold the answer. 

 Government tax credits brought a real estate revival this spring that now appears to be over. Figures on Wednesday showed single-family home sales plunged 33 percent to a record low in May, the month after the tax incentives expired. If housing is to stage a comeback, it will need a leg up from a job market that right now does not appear to be up to the task. "Of all the factors key to a housing recovery, jobs growth ranks No. 1 in importance right now," said Eric Belsky, executive director of the Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University. "Tax credits and improved affordability were yesterday's ingredients." The housing market's recovery from a 2006-2009 price slump is pivotal to the broader U.S. economy due to the ripple effects it will have on consumer durable purchases, corporate profits and thousands of jobs linked to the industry. Housing will play a role in the economy's ability to sustain growth when the Obama administration's stimulus package withers away around the end of this year. While the U.S. economy added jobs in six of the past seven months, May's data from the Labor Department showed disappointing private sector hiring, comprising a mere 41,000 of the 431,000 gain in nonfarm payrolls. The rest came from the once-a-decade census and those temporary jobs are going away in the next few weeks. The private sector needs to generate around 200,000 to 300,000 jobs a month over the next couple of months for unemployment to fall, according to Torsten Slok, senior economist at Deutsche Bank in New York. NO PAYCHECK, NO MORTGAGE PAYMENT Unemployment is closely tied to mortgage defaults, so if the jobless rate does not decline, as many as 5 million foreclosures could potentially be added to the current stock of about 2 million foreclosed homes, Slok said. "If unemployment does not start coming down at a faster speed, there could be a snowball effect on foreclosures," he said. Labor market conditions remain tough, with initial claims for unemployment benefits rising to 472,000 last week, the highest level in four weeks. Slok said claims below 400,000 would be a strong signal for the housing market. To help housing "we need to see the unemployment rate go down to 9 percent by the end of the year," Slok said. "If that does not happen, we could see home prices come down again, which would be a nightmare scenario for consumers and bad for banks," he said. The jobless rate is currently 9.7 percent, and a Reuters poll forecasts it to fall to only 9.5 percent by year end. Wednesday's single-family home sales were nothing short of "horrendous," Morningstar analyst Eric Landry said. Based on the current sales pace, it would take 8.5 months to work through the inventory of new homes, up from 5.8 months in April. Sales of previously owned U.S. homes unexpectedly fell last month, but supply dropped, figures on Tuesday showed. The government's tax credit of up to $8,000 clearly pulled forward demand, and it will take time to find fresh buyers. If there is a silver lining, it is that homebuilders have also cut back sharply, which helps sop up some of the excess inventory. HISTORY TO REPEAT? The link between housing recovery and the labor market was evident in the housing slumps of the early 1980s and 1990s. Coming out of a real estate downturn that ended in the second quarter of 1982, sales climbed more than 70 percent. Unemployment came down quickly back then. The jobless rate peaked at 10.8 percent in November 1982, and was down to 8.5 percent one year later. Few economists expect a repeat. After the 1991 slump, new home sales rebounded by only a little more than 25 percent over the next two years even though real interest rates fell by nearly 2 percentage points because the rebound in job growth was tepid. Although that recession officially ended in March 1991, the jobless rate did not peak until 15 months later and retreated only gradually. Jan Hatzius, chief U.S. economist at Goldman Sachs, said temporary boosts from government housing policies have faded and the housing market remains plagued by excess supply and high -- and apparently still rising -- mortgage delinquencies. "While not a component of our key house price determinants, stubbornly high unemployment could have an indirect impact on values through higher mortgage delinquencies," he said. Rising delinquencies tend to lower house prices. Given the excess supply and rising delinquencies, Goldman Sachs' model suggests that the composite 20-city Standard & Poor's/Case-Shiller Home Price Index will fall by about 3 percent over the next year and another 1 percent over the following year. "It is fairly safe to say a housing rebound is not around the corner," Harvard's Belsky said. (Additional Reporting by Helen Chernikoff; Editing by Andrew Hay)
