 PARIS  (Reuters) - French media group Lagardere, owner of 7.5 percent of EADS, on Wednesday renewed its support in the management of the Airbus maker after its merger talks with Britain's BAE Systems failed. 
 "Lagardere notes the end of tie-up talks between EADS and BAE Systems and renews its faith in the management of EADS," a spokesman for Lagardere told Reuters. (Reporting by Gwenaelle Barzic, Writing by Astrid Wendlandt, editing by Leigh Thomas)
