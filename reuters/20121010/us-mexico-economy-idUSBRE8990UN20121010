 MEXICO CITY  (Reuters) - Mexican gross fixed investment rose 0.9 percent in July from June, the national statistics agency said on Wednesday. 
 The measure of spending on machinery, equipment and new construction rose at a faster pace than the nearly 0.3 percent month-on-month rate in June, and the gauge expanded for the second straight month after posting its biggest drop in nearly 3-1/2 years in May. Solid U.S. demand for local exports has been supporting Mexican growth despite a wider global slowdown. Gross fixed investment was up 6.6 percent from the same month a year earlier compared to a 2.7 percent year-on-year rate seen in June. (Reporting by Michael O'Boyle; Editing by  James Dalgleish )
