 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - German automotive group Daimler remains in talks with the German government to lower its stake in European aerospace group EADS by selling a 7.5 percent holding to state-owned development bank KfW. 
 "We still aim to further reduce our stake in EADS this year," said a Daimler spokesman on Wednesday. Earlier EADS and BAE Systems called off the world's largest defense and aviation merger, with sources close to the talks blaming Germany for wrecking the $45 billion deal.
