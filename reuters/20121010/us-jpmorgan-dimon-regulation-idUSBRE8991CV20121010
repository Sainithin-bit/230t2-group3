 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said annual overhead costs from new domestic and international regulations will likely reach more than $1 billion. 
 Dimon, speaking at a Council on Foreign Relations event on Wednesday, said the costs come from the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law, as well as heightened international capital standards and EU regulations. (Reporting By  Karey Wutkowski ; Editing by Gerald E. McCormick)
