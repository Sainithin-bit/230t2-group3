 LONDON  (Reuters) - BHP Billiton ( BHP.AX ), the world's largest mining company, has decided to pull out of Guinea, putting its Mount Nimba iron ore project up for sale, the Sunday Times reported. 
 Reflecting a trend among major mining companies, BHP has said it would consider selling off more non-core operations to focus on simple, large-scale ones in light of flattening demand for some commodities. The newspaper reported that investment bank Nomura had been hired to find a buyer. No value on a potential deal was given. BHP could not immediately be reached for comment.
