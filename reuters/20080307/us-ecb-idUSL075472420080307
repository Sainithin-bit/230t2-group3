 PARIS/OSLO  (Reuters) - European Central Bank policymakers warned about the danger higher food and energy prices pose to inflation and said they were also keeping a close eye on turbulent financial markets. 

 ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet, speaking the day after the bank held rates steady at 4 percent, said unmet demand from emerging markets was to blame for food price rises that have pushed inflation to a record 3.2 percent high in the euro zone. "The current surge in commodity prices, including food more recently ... reminds us that globalization can also lead to upside risks in world inflation," he said at a Bank of France conference in Paris. Bank of France Governor Christian Noyer said higher commodity prices were a long-term trend. "The growth of emerging market economies ... are leading to a surge in the demand for natural resources, food, and energy, which logically has a strong and permanent impact on inflation." The ECB is currently caught in a policymaking dilemma, as high inflation gives it little scope to cut rates in response to increasing signs of a spillover from the housing-led slowdown in the United States. German Bundesbank President Axel Weber said that even with the falls in food prices assumed in Thursday's new ECB staff forecasts -- which the bank's rate-setting Governing Council does not formally endorse -- inflation looked set to be above target into next year. "The current inflationary outlook and the medium-term upside risks are our major concern," he told a Norwegian central bank conference. "Weaker growth prospects do not pose sufficient reason to expect a dampening of inflationary pressures in the foreseeable future," he said. ECB Vice-President Lucas Papademos said later that inflation developments had been unsatisfactory and that the ECB was committed to thwart any wage-price spiral emerging. INFLATION EXPECTATIONS RISING Bond markets showed investors' long-term inflation expectations were rising, but some in the markets were still too complacent about price dangers, Weber said. "There seems to be some underestimation of inflation risks in the market. We made clear by publishing our staff forecast that we do see persistent and prolonged inflation risks," he said. "For me, the way forward (for monetary policy) is pretty clear." By contrast, most private-sector economists expect the ECB to cut rates to 3.75 percent by the end of June and at least once more later in the year, despite Trichet's efforts to play down such hopes on Thursday. Weber said the euro zone growth slowdown that started in the last three months of 2007 seemed to be continuing but economic activity should start to return to its long-term trend in the second half of this year. ECB staff forecast euro zone inflation of around 2.9 percent this year and 2.1 percent in 2009, with growth averaging 1.7 percent this year before edging up to 1.8 percent next year. Weber's ECB colleague Klaus Liebscher told Austrian news agency APA that economic fundamentals in the euro zone were still healthy, though the 15-member bloc would not wholly escape the effects of weakening global growth. MARKET TURMOIL Financial market turmoil was making reading the economy harder, Noyer and his Dutch counterpart Nout Wellink said. "We must remain exceptionally alert and flexible to encounter adverse dynamics that may threaten financial or economic stability," Wellink said at the Bank of France event. Trichet agreed. "We are very closely monitoring the ongoing significant market correction we have experienced since the middle of last year, taking into account all their possible consequences, including on inflation." One element of the market turmoil is the strength of the euro against the dollar  EUR= , which hit a fresh record of $1.5459 earlier on Friday, according to Reuters data. Trichet declined to comment on the latest move, but said excessive currency market volatility was undesirable, as did Liebscher. "We have a weak dollar situation. The euro's exchange rate helps to reduce energy and commodity prices," Liebscher said. ECB Executive Board member Juergen Stark said the bank took the medium-term impact of the euro's strength on inflation into account when setting rates. But he said there was no sense in which the ECB felt obliged to follow U.S. Federal Reserve's recent rate cuts and pursue a target for the euro's level against the dollar. "Having inside knowledge, I can in fact rule out ... any sign of a leader-follower structure or any sign of a focus on the side of the ECB on the dollar-euro exchange rate, or in fact on any exchange rate, as a target of policy," he said. "Any development in that direction would be deeply worrying."
