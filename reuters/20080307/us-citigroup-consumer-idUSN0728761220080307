 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Citigroup Inc ( C.N ) Chief Executive Vikram Pandit is considering top-level changes in its U.S. consumer business to boost the unit's performance, according to the Financial Times, citing people close to the situation. 

 The paper said Pandit was looking both inside and outside Citigroup for experienced retail bankers to help lead the unit. No final decision on the top ranks of the U.S. consumer business unit had been made as Pandit is still in the middle of a review of all Citigroup businesses, the paper said citing people close to the situation. Citigroup was not immediately available for comment. (Reporting by  Yinka Adegoke ; Editing by Erica Billingham)
