 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Large employers are more cautious about hiring amid signs of a slowing economy; but few are planning sweeping cuts in their work forces, and workers with specialized skills remain in demand. 

 A much weaker-than-expected February jobs report clearly raised the risk of recession, but the negative headline number masked strength in some sectors of the economy, like health care and education, staffing company executives said on Friday. The U.S. economy lost 63,000 jobs outside the farm sector last month, the second monthly loss in a row, defying expectations for jobs being added. The unemployment rate, based on a separate survey, eased to 4.8 percent, partly reflecting fewer people in the labor force, the Labor Department said. The government report also showed a decline in temporary employment as a percentage of the overall labor force -- a worrying sign, said BMO Capital Markets analyst Jeffrey Silber. "As a decline in this metric is typically a precursor for an oncoming recession, this is somewhat concerning," Silber said in a research note. Large employers, especially, are more cautious about hiring, taking longer to vet candidates and having to go higher in the organization to get approval for a hire, said Roy Krause, chief executive of staffing company Spherion Corp. "The interview process is getting extended, which is typical in a slowdown in the economy," Krause said. He said a slowdown in the service sector was the most worrisome aspect of Friday's report. Staffing companies are paying more attention to costs than a few months ago, Krause added. "We're going to be careful with our expansion plans, as far as opening new offices; but we are actively continuing to hire recruiters, because in the professional services area the number of jobs we have (is) still significant." Information technology and finance and accounting remain bright spots, Krause said, and the education and health care fields are looking for workers. Tig Gilliam, chief executive of Adecco Group North America, agreed. "Clients in the U.S. are saying that despite bearish economic indicators, they are still hiring critical positions for highly skilled professionals in engineering and scientific, as well as IT (information technology) workers," Gilliam said. Robert Morgan, co-president of recruitment and talent management at Hudson Highland Group, added legal and sales and marketing to the list of sectors where professionals remain in demand. "We're seeing stronger demand for talent than we've seen over the last six months," he said. NO DEEP JOB CUTS Many employers say they are expecting to cut a limited numbers of jobs. A chief executive officer confidence index this week showed the lowest level of optimism about future employment since 2003. CEO Magazine said 46 percent of those surveyed expected employment to decrease over the next quarter, while 12 percent predicted an increase. Another survey found that most human resources managers are concerned about the economy's impact on their company's performance. Most corporate leaders are now focused on crafting their response, according to the survey by Towers Perrin of about 500 HR professionals at large- and mid-sized companies. About 40 percent expect smaller, targeted jobs cuts, while about 11 percent expect a large-scale work force reduction, Towers Perrin found. The vast majority -- 70 percent -- said widespread job cuts were highly unlikely. The Standard & Poor's HR Employment Services index, which initially opened with losses Friday, was up slightly in morning trade. The index has lost about a quarter of its value since early August, when U.S. subprime mortgage problems showed signs of spreading and fueled concerns about a recession. The index is down by half from its 2006 peak. Some analysts see value in certain beaten-down staffing companies. Bear Stearns' Andrew Steinerman rates Manpower Inc and Robert Half International Inc "outperform," recommending those stocks to "patient investors." Manpower was down $1.90 or 3.3 percent to $56.00, while Robert Half fell 26 cents or 1 percent to $25.00 and Spherion Corp was down 1 cent at $6.16, all on the New York Stock Exchange. Swiss-based Adecco, the world's biggest staffing company, was 1.7 percent lower in Zurich. In trade on the Nasdaq, Monster Worldwide Inc shares were up 1 cent to $25.24, while Hudson Highland Group Inc rose 51 cents to $7.51 and Kelly Services Inc shares were up 8 cents to $18.58.
