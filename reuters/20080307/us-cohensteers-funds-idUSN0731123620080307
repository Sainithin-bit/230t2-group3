 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Cohen & Steers Inc ( CNS.N ), a publicly traded money-management firm, could face a proxy battle from a hedge fund over two of its closed-end funds, the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday. 

 According to the Journal, the hedge fund, Western Investment said the interests of the directors of Cohen & Steers' funds aren't aligned with those of their shareholders and that the directors aren't doing enough to boost the funds' values. The Journal said Cohen & Steers is the largest U.S. investor in real estate investment trusts. Cohen & Steers and Western Investment were not immediately available to comment.
