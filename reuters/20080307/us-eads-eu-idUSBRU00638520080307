 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - Golden shares in EU companies have no place in the bloc's internal market, the European Commission said on Friday when asked about reported moves by France and Germany to prevent foreigners having large stakes in Europe's aerospace and defense company EADS ( EAD.PA ). 

 "The general view on golden shares is clear. The European Commission doesn't think golden shares have their place in the single market," European Commission spokesman Oliver Drewes told a regular news briefing. The Financial Times reported France and Germany were finalizing changes to EADS's corporate by-laws to prevent foreigners from building large stakes in Europe's flagship aerospace and defense company. Drewes said the Commission has not seen any concrete proposals regarding EADS. Germany's Daimler AG ( DAIGn.DE ), a big EADS sharheolder, said there was no agreement yet any steps that could limit the influence of foreign investors.
