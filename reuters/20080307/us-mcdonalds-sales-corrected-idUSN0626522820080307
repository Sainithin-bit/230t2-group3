 Corrects percent to percentage points 

 By  Lisa Baertlein LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - McDonald's Corp ( MCD.N ) may report a bit of a bounce in U.S. February sales after a slow turn of the year, but the twin challenges of food costs and a slumping domestic economy will keep improvement modest, analysts and investors said. The world's biggest hamburger chain is due to report global same-store sales before the bell on Monday and company watchers from Wall Street to Main Street hope improved U.S. results will put an end to speculation that previous softness -- in December particularly -- had more to do with the economy than weather. Analysts and investors are looking for U.S. sales growth of anywhere from 1 percent to more than 4 percent from a year ago, excluding the Leap Year impact, which added a day of sales. "I don't necessarily think the U.S. is going to be weak, but I don't think we're going to get knocked over with a big number," said Scott Rothbort, president and founder of LakeView Asset Management in New Jersey. Deutsche Bank Securities analysts are targeting same-store sales growth of 1.5 percent in the United States, 5 percent for Europe and 5 percent for the combined Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa regions. Their forecast excludes the Leap Year impact, which is expected to boost results by about 4 percentage points. "From an industry standpoint, macro indicators remain weak, with consumer confidence (the most important figure to watch, in our view) sliding to a multi-year low and disposable income growth slowing," Deutsche Bank analysts said in a client note on Thursday. "Obviously, we'd like to see higher numbers," said Janna Sampson, co-chief investment officer at Oakbrook Investments. She and Rothbort are expecting U.S. sales growth that is roughly in line with the Deutsche Bank target. Other analysts are more bullish. UBS Securities analyst David Palmer is eyeing U.S. February same-store sales growth of 8 percent, including a roughly 4 percentage point Leap Year lift and improving fast-food trends. "Based on our industry conversations, we believe U.S. fast food industry sales accelerated slightly" in February, with the growth rate rising about 1 percentage point from January, Palmer said in a client note. Elsewhere, RBC Capital Markets analyst Larry Miller expects U.S. same-store sales to rise 8.9 percent -- including a 4.2 percentage point Leap Year benefit -- helped by the company's two-day McSkillet burrito giveaway and continued strength in double cheeseburger sales. Because of their focus on value, McDonald's and its fast-food peers are considered more recession resilient than so-called casual restaurants that have suffered traffic declines for two years or more. McDonald's is considered one of the best-managed quick-serve chains and its overall results have benefited from strong growth overseas. U.S. same-stores sales at the Golden Arches were flat in December, falling to the lowest monthly level in nearly five years. McDonald's blamed severe weather for the soft results. U.S. same-store sales were up 1.9 percent in January despite a continuation of tough winter conditions, causing some investors to question the true impact of weather. "We were a little skeptical about the weather excuse. It seemed a little convenient," Sampson said. Shares in McDonald's are up more than 20 percent from a year ago and trade at a multiple of about 17 times analysts' earnings estimates for 2008. (Editing by  Braden Reddall )
