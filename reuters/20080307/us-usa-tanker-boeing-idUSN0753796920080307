 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Boeing Co ( BA.N ) said on Friday it would seriously consider challenging a U.S. Air Force decision to give a $35 billion aerial tanker program to a team that includes its European archrival Airbus. 

 After receiving an Air Force briefing on the victory of Northrop Grumman Corp ( NOC.N ) and Airbus parent EADS ( EAD.PA ), Boeing officials said they were left with "significant concerns about the process in several areas, including program requirements related to capabilities, cost and risk; evaluation of the bids and the ultimate decision." Boeing added in a statement it would take the next few days to evaluate the data presented and will give "serious consideration to filing a protest." (Reporting by  Jim Wolf )
