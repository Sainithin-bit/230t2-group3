 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Following are key comments by Bank of Japan Governor Toshihiko Fukui at a news conference after the central bank left the key overnight call rate target unchanged at 0.5 percent. It was the last regular rate review for Fukui, whose term ends on March 19. 

 MONETARY POLICY "Monetary policy decisions must be made in a lively way with an eye on the economic outlook. One can argue that interest rates are too high or too low just by looking at a snapshot of the economy, but there is not much meaning in doing so other than for an analytical purposes. "Many people might say that a snapshot of the economy suggests that interest rates are very low and monetary policy is accommodative. But there are many downside risks for Japan's economy as well as upside risks. We need to guide monetary policy so as not to put Japan's economy in dire straits. "The policy board discussed this in depth today but we judged that for now, it was best to keep rates steady even though a snapshot of the economy suggests that rates might be too low. "That is not to say that we ignore snapshots of the economy all the time. We make policy decisions at each board meeting by forecasting the outlook for the economy, taking into account new factors that come up each time. "Still, we would not say that we must raise interest rates by all means just because a snapshot of the economy might suggest they are too low." ECONOMY "We haven't seen any strikingly big change in economic conditions since the previous policy board meeting three weeks ago, but downside risks to the global economy, particularly the U.S. economy, are heightening somewhat. Global financial markets are also more unstable than before. "Stocks and currency moves have been volatile, which reflects the fact that while the global economy continues to expand, downside risks, particularly those for the U.S. economy, are increasing. "As for exports, those to the United States are weak but shipments to a wide range of countries, particularly to emerging countries and oil producing nations, continue to increase. We expect exports to keep rising as overseas economies are seen expanding, albeit at a slower pace than previously expected. "Japan's economy continues to be swayed largely by overseas economic developments, so we need to keep a close eye on the impact from developments abroad. "Japan's economy is highly likely to expand gradually with the positive cycle of output, income and expenditure to basically remain in place. "It's true that domestic housing investment is slowing and uncertainties in global economic and market developments are big. What we need to do, and plan to do, is to make appropriate policy decisions with an eye on risks and by closely examining upcoming data, information as well as domestic and overseas market developments." YEN RISE, STOCK FALLS "Volatility is rising in foreign exchange and stock markets, including those in Europe, the United States and Japan. "Investors have become reluctant to take risks and they are shifting their positions towards safer assets. "As a result, there are unusual changes in various markets. There are very irregular daily moves in currency and stock markets." "It is difficult and inappropriate to focus only on the strength in the yen. It is no longer only currency movements that affect corporate activity. The bottom line is how the global economy as a whole and market conditions will affect supply and demand conditions in Japan." "For non-oil producing developed countries like Japan, rises in raw material costs hurt the terms of trade and that clouds corporate profits even though they are at high levels. "A strong yen could somewhat be a disadvantage for exporters, but it will improve the terms of trade, hurt by higher costs that are prompted by overseas factors such as rises in commodity, raw material and crude oil prices. "So they offset each other and we cannot reach a correct answer without combining those factors and see how much stress they will have on the Japanese economy and firms' businesses." FUKUI'S SUCCESSOR  "As the government and parliament will start its process, I refrain from commenting on candidates. "I have been saying that I am confident that someone most suited for the position will be chosen under the current political situation. I believe that government and parliamentary procedures are heading toward that direction. "Public trust for the BOJ can only be gained by not making any misjudgment in policy decisions. There is no way of gaining trust other than to make timely and necessary policy decisions." (Asked if he ever thought about the possibility of being reappointed as BOJ governor:) "I have never thought of anything but putting 100% into fulfilling my term." BOJ INDEPENDENCE "Some speak about the separation of fiscal policy and monetary policy, but I would like to speak more broadly about the relationship between the government's economic policy and the BOJ's monetary policy. "The BOJ Law stipulates that the government and the central bank need to communicate well so that their basic economic view and policy direction do not deviate much. It also says that the BOJ's policy board is 100 percent responsible for making monetary policy decisions. "To separate fiscal and monetary policy is to act under this basic framework of the BOJ law. I have based my actions on this understanding and I believe my fellow board members have done the same." (Reporting by  Leika Kihara  and  Yoko Nishikawa )
