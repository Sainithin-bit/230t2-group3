 TOKYO  (Reuters) - The Japanese government put forward deputy central bank governor Toshiro Muto on Friday as the next head of the Bank of Japan, raising the prospect of a showdown with an opposition wary of his close government ties. 

 A political wrangle over the nomination has dented the government's credibility and raised concern about a policy vacuum in the midst of global market turmoil once current BOJ governor Toshihiko Fukui retires in 12 days. The nomination came as the central bank, in Fukui's last scheduled review, left interest rates unchanged at 0.5 percent as widely expected and downgraded its outlook for the Japanese economy. The government put forward 64-year-old Muto, long seen as its favored candidate, a nomination paper provided to Reuters showed, confirming reports by ruling party and opposition lawmakers. Muto was also the pick of the markets, despite a risk that the opposition, led by the Democratic Party, may veto him. "There is a 50-50 chance of the Muto nomination going through. It's hard for one to predict whether it can or not, as it is now totally up to the political situation within the Democratic Party," said Masamichi Adachi, a senior economist at JPMorgan Securities. Opposition parties can block Muto because they control parliament's upper house, which must approve the appointment. Democratic Party secretary general Yukio Hatoyama said his party would set its stance on the nominees on Tuesday and seek a vote on Wednesday, two days earlier than the government proposed. "They shouldn't set voting on a day when a 'no' vote will lead to a policy vacuum," Hatoyama told reporters. If he clears the political hurdle, Muto will take charge of interest rates at a time when Japan's growth is stumbling, thanks to the credit crunch that has raised fears of a U.S. recession. The BOJ, in a monthly outlook report, acknowledged growth was slowing due to a domestic housing slump and high prices for oil and other raw materials. "There are many downside risks for Japan's economy as well as upside risks. We need to guide monetary policy so as not to put Japan's economy in dire straits," Fukui told reporters. Some economists say Japan, the world's second-biggest economy, may already be in recession and the BOJ may need to cut its already very low interest rates this year. Muto is less hawkish than Fukui, some analysts say, which suggests he might be more willing to cut rates, although he has voted with his boss at every review since joining the BOJ board five years ago. OPPOSITION WARY Resistance to Muto centers on concerns that he was previously a vice finance minister, a senior bureaucratic position in the administration. Some opposition lawmakers say appointing such a person would undermine the central bank's independence. "We have been saying at informal meetings that it would be hard to accept Muto if he is nominated," Kenji Yamaoka, the parliamentary affairs chief of the main opposition Democratic Party, told reporters. While markets have focused on U.S. recession fears and a sliding dollar, traders say months of political paralysis on a range of issues, including the BOJ succession, have weighed on Japanese stocks. "To look at this on the bright side, a candidate has been put forward who seems to be an entirely reasonable choice. But he is not the person who is going to drastically change Japan," said Ken Masuda, a senior equities dealer at Shinko Securities. "But the big worry here was that they wouldn't be able to decide on someone, and that would lead to further selling (of stocks)." The government put forward Masaaki Shirakawa, a former BOJ official, and academic Takatoshi Ito as deputy governors. "Professor Ito has been pretty critical of the BOJ and has been a proponent of inflation targeting, writing a book on the topic. So it will be interesting how he functions in the BOJ," said Lehman Brothers economist Hiroshi Shiraishi. The nominations will be considered by parliament next week and ministers called for an end to the political row. "We cannot allow any policy vacuum with the BOJ governor at a time when global economic conditions are unstable," Finance Minister Fukushiro Nukaga told a news conference on Friday. RULING PARTY CONFIDENT If a replacement is not found by Fukui's retirement date of March 19, a temporary governor would step in. Analysts say it is unlikely that a stopgap governor would take long-term decisions. Failure to agree on a new governor, on top of a wider political paralysis in parliament, could undermine Japan's market credibility, they say. "If a vacuum in the BOJ governor's position were to occur, that would likely provide foreign investors with one more reason to sell Japanese stocks, though the actual impact on policy-making is very small," said Kazuhiro Takahashi, general manager of equity marketing at Daiwa Securities SMBC. Japan's economy had been growing steadily, enabling Fukui to raise interest rates to 0.5 percent from zero. He had sought to continue raising rates to more normal levels but that policy has been hamstrung by the global credit turmoil.
