 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - McDonald's Corp ( MCD.N ) may report a rebound in U.S. sales for February after a slow turn of the year, but the twin challenges of food costs and a slumping domestic economy will keep improvement modest, analysts and investors said. 

 The world's biggest hamburger chain plans on Monday, before the market opens, to report global sales at restaurants open at least 13 months. Company watchers from Wall Street to Main Street will look to see whether improved U.S. results will put an end to speculation that previous softness, particularly in December, had more to do with the economy than weather. U.S. same-store sales growth estimates from analysts and investors range from about 1 percent to more than 4 percent from a year earlier, excluding the impact of Leap Year, which added an extra day this February. "I don't necessarily think the U.S. is going to be weak, but I don't think we're going to get knocked over with a big number," said Scott Rothbort, president and founder of LakeView Asset Management in New Jersey. Deutsche Bank Securities analysts are targeting same-store sales growth of 1.5 percent for the United States, 5 percent for Europe and 5 percent for the combined Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa regions, before the effects of Leap Year. "From an industry standpoint, macro indicators remain weak, with consumer confidence (the most important figure to watch, in our view) sliding to a multiyear low and disposable income growth slowing," Deutsche Bank analysts said in a client note on Thursday. Rothbort and Janna Sampson, co-chief investment officer at Oakbrook Investments, are expecting U.S. sales growth that is roughly in line with the Deutsche Bank target. "Obviously, we'd like to see higher numbers," Sampson said. A poll of 33 franchisees who operate 214 McDonald's U.S. restaurants open at least 13 months showed that sales rose 0.5 percent to 1 percent, excluding the extra day in February, restaurant analyst Mark Kalinowski said on Friday. While the franchisees surveyed operate a small portion of the company's roughly 14,000 U.S. restaurants, Kalinowski said that in 30 previous surveys, his same-store sales results have come within 1 percentage point of the actual figure on 21 occasions. Others are more bullish. UBS Securities analyst David Palmer is expecting U.S. February same-store sales growth of 8 percent, reflecting a Leap Year lift of 4 percentage points and improving fast-food trends. "Based on our industry conversations, we believe U.S. fast food industry sales accelerated slightly" in February, with the growth rate rising about 1 percentage point from January, Palmer wrote in a client note. Elsewhere, RBC Capital Markets analyst Larry Miller expects U.S. same-store sales to rise 8.9 percent -- including a 4.2 percentage-point Leap Year benefit -- helped by the company's two-day McSkillet burrito giveaway and continued strength in double cheeseburger sales. Because of their focus on value, McDonald's and its fast-food peers are considered more recession-resilient than so-called casual restaurants that have suffered traffic declines for two years or more. McDonald's is considered one of the best-managed quick-serve chains, and its overall results have benefited from strong growth overseas. U.S. same-stores sales at the Golden Arches were flat in December, falling to the lowest monthly level in nearly five years. McDonald's blamed severe weather for the soft results. In January, U.S. same-store sales showed a 1.9 percent rise despite a continuation of tough winter conditions, causing some investors to question the true impact of weather. "We were a little skeptical about the weather excuse," Sampson said. "It seemed a little convenient." McDonald's shares are up more than 20 percent from a year ago and trade at about 17 times analysts' earnings estimates for 2008.
