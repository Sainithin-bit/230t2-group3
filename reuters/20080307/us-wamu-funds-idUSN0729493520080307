 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Washington Mutual Inc ( WM.N ) and other lenders have approached private-equity firms and sovereign-wealth funds to discuss cash infusions, according to the Wall Street Journal, citing people familiar with the situation. 

 The paper said concern that mounting losses and mortgage-related investments could threaten the health of the U.S. banking system is spurring regulators to ask some banks to seek outside capital. Seattle-based WaMu, the largest U.S. savings-and-loan institution, is one of the biggest lenders looking to line up additional capital, the paper reported. Washington Mutual was not immediately available for comment. (Reporting by  Yinka Adegoke , editing by Will Waterman)
