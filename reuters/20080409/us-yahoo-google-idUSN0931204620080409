 SAN FRANCISCO/NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Yahoo Inc is in advanced talks to carry Web search advertising from Google Inc as part of a search for potential alternatives to being bought by Microsoft Corp, a source familiar with the discussions said on Wednesday. 

 Yahoo also is still in talks with Time Warner Inc's AOL about a potential tie-up, the person said. Shares of Yahoo rose 12 cents to $27.82, Microsoft was up 15 cents to $28.90, and Google shares fell 0.5 percent to $465.00, all on Nasdaq. Yahoo's use of Google search would be for a limited test, the source said. The Google talks were first reported by the Wall Street Journal's Web site. Yahoo spokeswomen were unavailable for comment. A Google spokesman declined to comment, saying he was not aware of the story and was not aware if the Wall Street Journal had called his company for comment.
