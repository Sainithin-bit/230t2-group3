 SAN ANTONIO  (Reuters) - Dallas Federal Reserve Bank President Richard Fisher said on Wednesday that he is not opposed to cutting interest rates but prefers working on the central bank's liquidity measures to shore up financial markets. 

 "I don't want to be party to inflating our economy," he said in answering questions after delivering prepared remarks to a Dallas Fed community forum, adding that Fed monetary policy acts with a lag. The Fed regional bank president cautioned that inflation in food and energy prices is driven by global demand and was unlikely to fade quickly.
