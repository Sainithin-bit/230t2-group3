 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Boeing Co ( BA.N ) delayed its 787 Dreamliner for the third time on Wednesday, putting the project about 15 months behind the original delivery schedule. 

 The U.S. plane maker is pioneering a new way of making its latest carbon-composite aircraft, outsourcing most of the structure and components to companies around the world and assembling the pieces at its plant in Everett, Washington. Its major suppliers, which Boeing calls "risk partners", stand to gain if the project is ultimately successful. But the longer the delay, the more they face uncertainty about when -- and how much -- they will be paid by Boeing. The following is a list of the biggest suppliers on the 787, where they are based and what they are producing. -- Toray Industries ( 3402.T ) (Japan, carbon-composite fiber) -- General Electric ( GE.N ) (US, engines) -- Rolls-Royce ( RR.L ) (UK, engines) -- Mitsubishi Heavy Industries ( 7011.T ) (Japan, wings) -- Kawasaki Heavy Industries ( 7012.T ) (Japan, forward fuselage) -- Fuji Heavy Industries ( 7270.T ) (Japan, center wing box) -- Spirit Aerosystems ( SPR.N ) (US, forward fuselage, nose) -- Honeywell International ( HON.N ) (US, flight control electronics) -- Rockwell Collins ( COL.N ) (US, flight deck display) -- Hamilton Sundstrand, a unit of United Technologies ( UTX.N ) (USA, internal power systems) -- Alenia Aeronautica, part of Finmeccanica ( SIFI.MI ) (Italy, horizontal stabilizer, central fuselage) -- Vought Aircraft Industries, owned by Carlyle Group CYL.UL (USA, aft fuselage) -- KAL-ASD, a unit of Korean Air ( 003490.KS ) (S. Korea, wing tips) -- Goodrich Corp GR.N (US, wheels, brakes) -- Messier-Dowty, part of Safran ( SAF.PA ) (France/UK, landing gear) -- Latecoere ( LAEP.PA ) (France, passenger doors) -- Saab Aerostructures ( SAABb.ST ) (Sweden, cargo doors) Sources: Boeing, supplier companies.
