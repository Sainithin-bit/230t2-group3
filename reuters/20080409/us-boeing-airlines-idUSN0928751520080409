 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - More than 50 airlines and leasing companies have ordered Boeing Co's ( BA.N ) new 787 Dreamliner -- many of which will have to rethink their fleet plans in the wake of the latest delay on the aircraft, announced on Wednesday. 

 With deliveries now set to begin in the third quarter of 2009 -- about 15 months behind the original schedule -- some airlines will be forced to use older, less fuel-efficient planes or lease newer, more expensive ones, as they wait for late 787s. Airlines will be eligible for some form of compensation from Boeing for late deliveries, but Boeing has said it is too early to say how much that will cost. If delays on the plane got even longer, airlines might postpone or cancel 787 orders, which would likely boost sales of Boeing's established 767 and 777 models and increase interest in the competing A350 XWB of EADS ( EAD.PA ) unit Airbus. The following is a list of the largest buyers of the 787, followed by their countries, where not obvious, and the number of firm 787 orders they hold. -- International Lease Finance Corp (United States, 74)* -- Qantas Airways ( QAN.AX ) (Australia, 65) -- All Nippon Airways ( 9202.T ) (Japan, 50) -- Air Canada ( ACa.TO ) (37) -- JAL International 9205.T (Japan, 35) -- Qatar Airways (30) -- Air India AI.UL (27) -- LAN Airlines LAN.SN (Chile, 26) -- Continental Airlines CAL.N (United States, 25) -- Air Berlin ( AB1.DE ) (Germany, 25) -- British Airways BAY.L (24) -- Aeroflot ( AFLT.MM ) (Russia, 22) -- ALAFCO ( ALAF.KW ) (Kuwait, 22) -- LCAL (Dubai, 21) -- Singapore Airlines ( SIAL.SI ) (20) -- Northwest Airlines NWA.N (United States, 18) -- Virgin Atlantic Airways VA.UL (United Kingdom, 15) -- Dubai Aerospace Enterprises (United Arab Emirates, 15) -- Air China ( 601111.SS ) (15) -- China Eastern Airlines ( 600115.SS ) (15) Source: Boeing. * ILFC, a plane lessor, is owned by U.S. insurer American International Group Inc ( AIG.N ).
