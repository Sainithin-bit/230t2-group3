 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - A U.S. senator who heads an antitrust subcommittee said on Wednesday that he was watching Yahoo Inc's test tie-up with Google closely "to ensure that it does not harm competition." 

 Yahoo said on Wednesday it would carry Web search advertising from Google in a test that could put pressure on Microsoft Corp to raise its bid to buy the company. "We will be following closely the results of the short-term test alliance between Yahoo! and Google," Sen. Herb Kohl, a Wisconsin Democrat, said in a statement. "Should there be moves to make this agreement permanent, we will examine it closely in the Antitrust Subcommittee to ensure that it does not harm competition." (Reporting by  Diane Bartz )
