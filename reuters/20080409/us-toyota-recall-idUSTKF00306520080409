 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp. ( 7203.T ) said on Wednesday it would recall 628,239 vehicles in Japan due to faulty installation of fuel tanks. 

 The recall would involve Noah and Voxy minivans sold only in Japan, the nation's largest automaker in a filing with the transport ministry. It said the total cost of the recall is still unclear. Toyota's shares were trading down 0.4 percent at 4,910 yen as of 1:19 a.m. EDT, against a 2.0 percent fall in the benchmark Nikkei average. (Reporting by  Mariko Katsumura )
