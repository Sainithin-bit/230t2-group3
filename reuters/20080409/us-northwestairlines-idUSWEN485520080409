 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Northwest Airlines said on Tuesday it will roll back minimum stay requirements announced last week, after US Airways failed to match the new policy. 

 On April 4, Northwest was one of several airlines that said it would extend minimum stay requirements for many domestic leisure fares in order to raise revenue to cover escalating fuel costs. UAL Corp's United Airlines, Delta Air Lines Inc, AMR Corp's American Airlines, and Continental Airlines Inc also said they would initiate similar policies. But US Airways Group did not go along, so Northwest said it would remove the extended stay requirements for its competing flights. (Reporting by  Ilaina Jonas , editing by Richard Chang)
