 SAN ANTONIO, Texas  (Reuters) - Dallas Federal Reserve Bank President Richard Fisher said on Wednesday that the U.S. central bank had taken "substantial and many" measures to boost market liquidity, and had not yet run out of options. 

 "I do not think we have exhausted our tool kit. But at the same time, the measures and initiatives that we have taken are to be considered against doing the minimum necessary to restore market efficacy," Fisher told reporters. He said the Fed's actions have helped ease strains in financial markets caused by the housing crisis. "I hope and I think that it has alleviated some of the pressures," he said.
