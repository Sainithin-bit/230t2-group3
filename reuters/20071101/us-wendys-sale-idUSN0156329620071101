 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Potential suitors for Wendy's International Inc WEN.N have until November 12 to submit bids, and a financing package assembled by its banks could lead to lower offers, the Wall Street Journal reported Thursday in its online edition. 

 Its lenders, JP Morgan Chase ( JPM.N ) and Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc LEH.N, told potential buyers this week of a so-called "staple financing" package, a person familiar with the matter told the newspaper. According to the Wall Street Journal, the package is anchored by a securitization of royalty fees that franchisees pay Wendy's. Instead of relying on a bridge loan while the securitization is being arranged, the banks have a "backstop loan" that would kick in if the securitization does not come through, the newspaper said. The hamburger chain's lenders are also requiring a provision that would allow them to back out in the event of worsening financial conditions, the newspaper added. Representatives from Wendy's were not immediately available for comment. The newspaper also reported that a leading contender to buy Wendy's is a group headed by William Foley, the chairman of Fidelity National Financial Inc ( FNF.N ).
