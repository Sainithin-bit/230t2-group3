 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Specialty truck maker Oshkosh Truck Corp ( OSK.N ) posted a better-than-expected 73 percent rise in quarterly profit on Thursday, boosted by strong sales from the acquisition of JLG Industries Inc. 

 The company reported a fiscal fourth-quarter net profit of $85.4 million, or $1.14 a share, compared with $49.2 million, or 66 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales rose 98 percent to $1.8 billion, boosted by $840 million in sales from JLG, a maker of aerial worker platforms and other equipment. Analysts, on average, expected Oshkosh to earn $1.07 a share on revenue of $1.84 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. However, the company said its European refuse business, Geesink Norba Group, underperformed. The company said it plans a major restructuring that may include layoffs as it seeks to return the business to profitability. The company took charges of $4.8 million in the fourth quarter related to a "facility rationalization plan" at Geesink Norba. It said it expects further charges in fiscal 2008. Oshkosh reaffirmed its fiscal 2008 earnings estimate of $4.15 to $4.35 per share. Wall Street analysts had been expecting the company to earn $4.72 per share, according to Reuters Estimates.
