 SHANGHAI  (Reuters) - China will launch stock index futures soon and is ready to approve new quotas for foreign investors in the country's red hot stock markets, a senior exchange official said on Thursday. 

 China is trying to develop a stock futures market to give investors more options and help them hedge risk. But Zhou Qinye, executive vice president of the Shanghai Stock Exchange, the bigger of mainland China's two bourses, told a financial forum that the start of futures trading might initially increase selling pressure on the cash market. He did not elaborate on the exact timing of the launch but added that conditions were ripe for a stock futures market and preparations had been made. The introduction of futures has been delayed for about a year, partly because of concern it could destabilize the stock market. But top securities regulator Shang Fulin said last week that preparations for the new market were mostly complete. "China's stock market is still an emerging market that is in the process of transformation," Zhou said. "So you will see lots of new things to happen during the process," he added. China's main stock index has more than doubled so far this year, while Chinese companies have turned in explosive profit growth in the January-September period, further stoking a long-running stock market bull run.  As a result, the Shanghai Stock Exchange has become the world's sixth largest bourse by capitalization, Zhou said. But he said the market was too immature to allow regulators to remove a 10 percent daily limit on stock price movement -- a move suggested by some investors and analysts. "The fundamental structure of our stock market is still weak and many investors now have different opinions on the price and valuation," Zhou said. WELCOME FOREIGNERS China's stock markets are still largely off limits to foreign investors, although the government wants overseas institutions to play a bigger part in the world's fastest growing major market. Zhou said Chinese regulators had started the process of approving new quotas for foreign investors in an effort to diversify the types of active investors. But Beijing's approval process would be "gradual", he added. Foreigners can invest in Chinese securities under the Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor (QFII) scheme, but a $10 billion ceiling for combined investment under the scheme was reached in February. Foreign banks such as UBS ( UBSN.VX ) ( UBS.N ) and Credit Suisse ( CSGN.VX ) have already said they want bigger QFII quotas. China agreed in trade talks with the United States this year to raise the ceiling to $30 billion, but there have been no fresh QFII approvals since February. The eventual launch of China's stock index futures could happen before the end of this year and the government may also give some foreign banks bigger QFII quotas in the next couple of months, according to market sources.
