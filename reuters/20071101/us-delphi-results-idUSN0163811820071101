 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Bankrupt auto parts maker Delphi Corp DPHIQ.PK on Thursday reported a net loss of $794 million for September. 

 The disclosure came in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Delphi, which filed for bankruptcy protection in October 2005, earlier this week filed proposed revisions to its equity investment and reorganization plans and said it expected to seek a smaller exit financing package. The Troy, Michigan-based company expects to emerge from bankruptcy in the first quarter of 2008. (Reporting by  David Bailey )
