 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Timberland Co TBL.N and Steven Madden Ltd ( SHOO.O ) posted lower quarterly profits on Thursday, hurt by flagging demand, and both shoe companies forecast sales declines for the full year. 

 Separately, shares of Crocs Inc ( CROX.O ), the maker of brightly colored, clunky plastic shoes, dropped as much as 31.5 percent the day after its 2007 revenue and earnings outlook disappointed Wall Street. Timberland, whose shares fell nearly 10 percent, also announced a plan to reshuffle its U.S. sales team and streamline its product development, moves it expects will yield about $10 million in annual savings. Net profit for the shoe and clothing company fell to $25.9 million, or 42 cents a share, from $55.6 million, or 88 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding costs of closing some stores, earnings were 49 cents a share, in line with analysts' expectations, according to Reuters Estimates. Sales of Timberland's trademark work boots, long a fashion staple for urban customers, have suffered lately as footwear trends now favor sneakers, with slimmer profiles. Revenue fell 13.9 percent to $433.3 million. Sales declined 4.4 percent internationally, hurt by weakness in Europe and Canada. Global wholesale revenue fell by 17.3 percent, but direct-to-consumer sales rose 2.9 percent, helped by strength in Asia. For Long Island, New York-based Steven Madden, net income fell to $10.9 million, or 52 cents a share, from $12.6 million, or 57 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue fell nearly 8 percent to $113.4 million on lower sales in the wholesale and retail divisions. The company also cited a lack of big fashion footwear trends and tight consumer spending. However, Steve Madden stood by its full-year profit outlook, and its shares rose more than 2 percent. SALES, EARNINGS OUTLOOK For the current quarter, Timberland expects sales to decline in a mid-single digit percentage range, reflecting soft market conditions in the United States and Europe. The company expects 2007 sales of children's products and boots to fall by $100 million globally, and operating margin, excluding restructuring costs, to decline by 200 basis points. For the full year, Timberland expects revenue to fall in the mid-single-digits, and operating margin to decrease by 400 to 450 basis points. The company forecast a mid-single-digit revenue decline in 2008. It has already announced plans to close about 50 retail stores by the end of the year's first quarter in an attempt to boost profits. Madden said it expected full-year sales to fall by 9 percent to 11 percent, as it had forecast earlier. It also repeated its earnings outlook of $1.50 to $1.60 per share, excluding items. Timberland shares were down $1.93, or 9.9 percent, at $17.58 in morning New York Stock Exchange trade. Crocs was down $21, or 28.1 percent, at $53.75 on Nasdaq, where it was the worst percentage loser. Earlier the stock fell to $51.20. Also on Nasdaq, Madden rose 48 cents, or 2.2 percent, to $22.77.
