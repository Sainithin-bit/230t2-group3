 LONDON  (Reuters) - Travel company Thomas Cook ( TCG.L ) said on Thursday full-year earnings were on track and while Germany remained tough it was encouraged by UK holiday bookings for next year's summer season. 

 Thomas Cook, Europe's second-largest travel firm, created from the tie-up of KarstadtQuelle's travel unit and Britain's MyTravel, also said it was increasingly confident it would top the 140 million euros ($202.3 million) of cost savings it had originally expected from the deal. Analysts have estimated the firm could glean an extra 35-45 million euros in savings. "We have said there will be a one off cost of 125 million pounds in achieving that (95 million pound/140 million euro figure)," Chief Executive Manny Fontenla-Novoa told reporters. "By bringing down the one off costs and increasing the synergy amounts we think we may equalize those two amounts," he added. The firm, which sells around 6 million holidays a year, said it had seen a significant improvement in margins in the UK over the last eight weeks helped by its decision to cut back the number of holidays on offer and a dismal British summer sparking demand. It added winter bookings in the booming Scandinavian market were up 13 percent with summer holidays set to go on sale soon, while winter bookings were up 3 percent in continental Europe although prices had remained flat. Fontenla-Novoa told reporters that although its French business had seen an improvement the key German market continued to be tough due to overcapacity. He said the firm would maintain the number of holidays on sale in Germany while it would increase commission to German travel agents to encourage them to sell its holidays. He added the firm would tell investors at the start of next year whether it would pay a special dividend and said senior management had recently had a strategy meeting and would lay out plans later this month. Shares in the group rose 1.7 percent by 6:37 a.m. EDT to trade at 305 pence, valuing the business at around 3 billion pounds ($6.22 billion). With more information coming later in the month analysts held fire. "We leave our estimates for 2007 unchanged at 319.7 million euro profit before tax (22.9c earnings per share)," said Investec analyst Joe Thomas. "While current trading is clearly healthy, it is too early to change forecasts for the current year," he added.
