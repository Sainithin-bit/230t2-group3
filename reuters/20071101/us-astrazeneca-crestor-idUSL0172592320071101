 LONDON  (Reuters) - AstraZeneca Plc ( AZN.L ) said on Thursday that Canada's Cobalt Pharmaceuticals was seeking U.S. regulatory permission to sell a generic version of its anti-cholesterol pill Crestor. 

 The news sent shares in the Anglo-Swedish drugmaker 1.9 percent lower to 23.29 pounds in early trade. Cobalt believes it has found a legal loophole that would allow it to market a cheap copy of the medicine before AstraZeneca's patents expire. Crestor is covered by three key patents valid until 2016, 2020 and 2021. "AstraZeneca is evaluating Cobalt's allegations and certifications," AstraZeneca said in a statement. "AstraZeneca has full confidence in its intellectual property portfolio protecting Crestor." The news is a further blow to Britain's second-biggest drugmaker, which is already fighting generic threats to its two biggest revenue generators -- Nexium, for stomach acid, and Seroquel, for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Crestor, a newer drug that AstraZeneca originally licensed from Japan's Shionogi & Co Ltd ( 4507.T ), had sales in the second quarter of $678 million, out of total group sales of $7.27 billion. AstraZeneca views Crestor as a key growth driver for the business in the years ahead and has been running a major clinical trials program to try to prove its superiority to other similar statin drugs. The British-based company is due to report third-quarter results at 1100 GMT. Industry analysts expect it to report a fall of around 15 percent in quarterly earnings per share, hurt by generic competition to key drugs and acquisition costs. AstraZeneca is expected to unveil earnings of 85.4 cents on a reported basis, including amortization charges, Toprol XL and restructuring costs, according to a Reuters poll of analysts. The figures will be complicated by the takeover of MedImmune, costs from a savings program and the company's decision to focus on profit excluding the effect of generic forms of heart drug Toprol XL. The sales line should see revenues up some 9 percent, driven by demand for products like Seroquel and asthma treatment Symbicort, which was launched mid-year in the United States. Crestor should also show good year-on-year growth. Nexium, however, is expected to have had a lacklustre quarter. (Additional reporting by  Mark Potter )
