 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - CVS Caremark Corp ( CVS.N ) posted higher-than-expected quarterly profit on Thursday, helped by the addition of Caremark's pharmacy benefits business and increased sales at drugstores open at least a year. 

 CVS, one of the largest U.S. drugstore operators, said profit for the third quarter rose to $689.5 million, or 45 cents a share, from $284.2 million, or 33 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding 1 cent per share in costs related to CVS Corp's March acquisition of Caremark Rx Inc, the company earned 46 cents per share, beating by 2 cents analysts' average estimate, according to Reuters Estimates. The Caremark deal was part of a trend of drugstore chains moving to expand their businesses. The company has also been adding new stores in recent years. Net revenue rose 83 percent to $20.50 billion. Sales from CVS stores open more than one year rose 5 percent, as a 6.5 percent increase in front-end sales of items such as shampoo and aspirin was tempered by a 4.3 percent increase in pharmacy sales, which were hurt by recent introductions of cheaper, generic medicines. CVS trades at about 18 times estimated earnings for next year, compared with a multiple of about 15.9 for rival Walgreen Co ( WAG.N ).
