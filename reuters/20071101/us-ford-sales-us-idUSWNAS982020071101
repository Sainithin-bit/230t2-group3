 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co ( F.N ) posted on Thursday a 9.5 percent decline in U.S. sales for October, hurt by a drop in demand for its popular vehicles such as the F-Series pickup truck. 

 Ford also said it increased estimated fourth-quarter production by 5,000 units to 645,000 vehicles. The embattled U.S. automaker said it sold 195,462 vehicles in the United States last month, compared with 215,985 vehicles a year earlier. Results for Ford include its import brands and some medium- and heavy-duty trucks, and are not adjusted for the extra selling day in October 2007. Adjusted for selling days, the company's sales were down 13 percent. Ford said it reduced sales to daily rental car companies by 12,000 units in October, a 38 percent decline compared to an year ago. Year-to-date, Ford sales to daily rental companies were 142,000 units lower than the same period a year ago, the company said. Ford's truck sales were up 1 percent in October while car sales fell 26 percent. But sales of Ford's best selling F-Series full-size pickup truck fell 7.5 percent. (Reporting by  Poornima Gupta )
