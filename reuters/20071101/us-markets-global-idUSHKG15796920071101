 LONDON  (Reuters) - World stocks fell from earlier all-time highs on Thursday while credit market sentiment worsened as investors scaled back expectations for further monetary policy easing a day after the Fed cut interest rates. 

 Oil briefly topped $96 a barrel after an unexpectedly sharp fall in U.S. crude oil stocks, while gold hit a 28-year high, bolstered by the still weak dollar. Surging commodity prices lifted emerging market stocks, which hit an all-time high. Risky assets quickly erased Wednesday's gains and turned sharply lower. Investors have shifted their focus to the Fed's assessment that the risk of inflation was about equal to downside risks to growth, dampening expectations for future rate reductions. "(The Fed) indicated that they're moving towards a neutral bias which effectively takes out the probability of any cuts supporting the market," said Puneet Sharma, credit strategist at Barclays Capital. The MSCI main world equity index was down 0.4 percent, having earlier hit a record high. U.S. stock futures were down more than 1 percent, indicating a weaker open on Wall Street later. The FTSEurofirst 300 index  .FTEU3  was down 1.5 percent on the day. "We've got through the worst of the jitters in the credit market but there is a lot of concern about general global growth," said Ian Williams, strategist at Blue Oar Securities. The iTraxx Crossover index, mostly-widely watched indicator of European credit market sentiment, widened 22 bps to 340 bps. The euro was down 0.4 percent at $1.4425 after hitting a record high above $1.45 on Wednesday, bringing its gains since January to 9 percent. Sterling hit a fresh 26-year high of $2.0828 as investors grew confident that UK interest rates will stay on hold next week. INFLATION CONCERNS Yields on U.S. two-year note paper, the most sensitive to policy changes, stood at 3.9250 percent, off a two-year low around 3.70 percent hit last week. Euro zone two-year Schatz yields had risen to a high of 4.183 percent, their highest levels in two weeks. The Schatz yields have been supported by Wednesday's strong euro zone inflation data. Analysts say the rise in the oil prices and a weaker dollar could cause a break higher in U.S. inflation expectations, which could in turn hit risk appetite and force a further unwinding of Fed rate cut expectations. For now, however, there is little problem with inflation. Core U.S. consumer prices, measured in the Personal Consumption Expenditure data, were up a modest 0.2 percent in September. U.S. light crude oil was up more than 1 percent at $95.60 a barrel after surging above $96 earlier. Gold rose to $799.30 an ounce, its highest since January 1980. In the money market, interbank lending rates for overnight and three-month dollar deposits fell to 1-1/2 year lows. The rates have been coming down steadily before the Fed's move. "(The fall in dollar rates) is by no means a sign that the credit crunch is easing, rather an indication that the move was fully discounted by market participants," Nick Parsons, head of markets strategy at nabCapital, said in a note to clients. "We see little scope for the dollar Libor-funds spread to narrow below 30bp." Emerging market stocks .MSCIEF hit a record high while emerging sovereign spreads widened 3 basis points. -- Additional reporting by Atul Prakash
