 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co Ltd ( 7201.T ) said on Thursday its U.S. sales rose almost 9 percent in October despite evidence that wildfires in southern California had put a crimp on industry-wide sales in the final days of the month. 

 Sales for Nissan-brand vehicles rose 9.8 percent, while sales for the automaker's luxury Infiniti unit were up 1.8 percent from a year earlier, Mark McNabb, Nissan's senior vice-president for U.S. sales told Reuters. The gains were driven by a strong monthly performance for Nissan's flagship Altima sedan and the Infiniti G35 model, McNabb said. Sales were adjusted for an extra selling day last month compared with October 2006. McNabb said there was some evidence that retail sales had slowed in the last 10 days of the month, at the time southern California was hit by fires that drove some 500,000 people from their homes. "The last 10 days were definitely slower," McNabb said, adding that he wanted to look at the sales data more closely before estimating how much of the decline was directly fire related. On an industry-wide basis, McNabb said the U.S. market appeared headed for a 2007 sales tally of about 16 million units amid signs that the market had steadied after a weak summer when a weak housing market and credit concerns were blamed for undercutting auto sales results. "It seems to have stabilized a bit," McNabb told Reuters. "I think 16 (million) is a good call, but I still think there's risk." In 2006, industry-wide sales were 16.5 million units.
