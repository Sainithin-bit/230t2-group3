 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Sales incentives offered on new cars dropped nearly 4 percent in October in the U.S. market, contributing to an expected weak showing for retail vehicle sales, according to a report issued on Wednesday. 

 Auto sales incentives are widely tracked by analysts as an indication of the relative profitability of competing automakers and the pressure that they face to move inventory. Auto industry tracking service Edmunds.com estimated that the average manufacturer incentive was $2,195, down $89, or 3.9 percent, from a month earlier. "Incentive averages declined because the majority of vehicles being sold now are 2008 model year and don't require overly generous marketing support," said Jesse Toprak, executive director of industry analysis for Edmunds.com. "This typically occurs later in the calendar year." Automakers do not typically disclose how much they spend on incentives, which can include concessional financing, cash rebates or additional payments to dealers. Edmunds estimated that Ford Motor Co ( F.N ) led the industry in incentive spending in October with an average sales incentive of $3,208, down from $3,322 a year earlier. With major automakers expected to report October sales results on Thursday, Ford is expected to take the hardest hit, with sales seen down from 13 percent to 18 percent. Analysts expect overall October sales to have dipped due to a drag from weakness in the U.S. housing market and higher gas prices. Vehicle sales, widely watched as a leading indicator of U.S. consumer spending, began slowing in the second quarter and are expected to remain under pressure for the rest of 2007. Chrysler LLC was No. 2 at a per-vehicle average of $3,171, down from $4,149 a year earlier. General Motors Corp ( GM.N ), whose incentives rose from a year earlier, was third at $3,118, up from $2,575 a year earlier. GM's incentives have heated up particularly on pickup trucks, as it competes with other automakers who have also incentivized that segment heavily. Pickups, typically one of the industry's most profitable segments and traditionally purchased by construction workers, have come under pressure amid a tepid construction market. Large trucks had the highest average incentives, at $4,188 per vehicle, compared with compact cars, which averaged incentives at $849 a vehicle. Among brands, GM's Cadillac spent the most, at an average of $4,953 a vehicle. Of the major automakers, Honda Motor Co Ltd ( 7267.T ) offered the lowest incentives at $653 a vehicle. Toyota Motor Corp ( 7203.T ) had the second-highest price concessions at $710 a vehicle.
