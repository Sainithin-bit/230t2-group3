 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co's ( F.N ) 13 percent decline in October U.S. sales was "almost all" due to a planned reduction in sales to daily car rental companies, George Pipas, the automaker's chief sales analyst, said on Thursday. 

 "Almost all of this is due to a previously planned reduction in daily rental sales," Pipas said on a conference call. Ford said it reduced sales to daily rental car companies by 12,000 units in October, a 38 percent decline compared to a year ago. Pipas also said he expects sales in 2008 to be down in most months, but declined to be more specific.
