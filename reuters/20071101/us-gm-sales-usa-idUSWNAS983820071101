 DETROIT  (Reuters) - General Motors Corp ( GM.N ) said on Thursday U.S. sales fell an adjusted 0.6 percent in October, as a weak housing market and higher gas prices offset strong demand for the automaker's new products. 

 GM said it sold 307,408 vehicles in the United States last month compared to 297,401 vehicles a year earlier. The figures refer to light vehicle sales and were adjusted for an extra selling day last month.
