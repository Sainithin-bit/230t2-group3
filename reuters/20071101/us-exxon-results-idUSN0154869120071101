 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp. ( XOM.N ) said on Thursday its third-quarter earnings declined 10 percent, missing expectations on sharply dropping profits from gasoline production and lower natural gas prices. 

 Exxon's stock fell about 2.7 percent in afternoon trading and was a weight on the Dow Jones Industrial Average  .DJI , which was down 1.9 percent. Margins to produce and sell gasoline and other refined products fell sharply during the quarter, accounting for more than two-thirds of the drop in profits from last year. The plummeting refining margins cut into gains from an oil price surge that saw crude hit $78 in September before marching on to new records in the fourth quarter. Net income at the world's largest publicly traded company fell to $9.41 billion, or $1.70 a share, from $10.49 billion, or $1.77 a share, a year earlier. Analysts, on average, had expected the company to earn $1.74 a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Refining margins crashed by as much as 90 percent from record highs reached in May, as the summer driving season ended, oil prices surged and gasoline prices did not keep up with the price increases. These reduced profits have also dragged down earnings at Exxon's largest competitors, BP Plc ( BP.L ), Royal Dutch Shell Plc ( RDSa.L ), and ConocoPhillips ( COP.N ), offsetting oil prices that were much higher than a year before. The margins have remained tight in the fourth quarter, threatening to hold back earnings even as U.S. crude prices have surged over $90 a barrel. "There's a real blood bath in refining margins right now, and that will largely offset the higher upstream earnings," said John S. Herold analyst Lysle Brinker. SECOND DROP IN A ROW It is the first time since 2002 that the company has had two consecutive quarterly earnings drops -- a period marked by a wild bull market for oil during which crude prices have tripled. Exxon has been hugely profitable over those years, pulling in more than $155 billion in profits. Even now, the company is just $300 million behind last year's earnings for the first nine months of 2006, a year when it posted the largest full-year profit in U.S. history. Revenue in the third-quarter rose 2.8 percent to $102.34 billion, a new record for the company. Profits from its refining and marketing unit fell to $2 billion, down $737 million on the lower margins. Earnings from Exxon's exploration and production operations slipped 3 percent to $6.3 billion on lower natural gas prices and higher expenses. Oil and gas production in the quarter fell 2 percent, due in part to shifts from production-sharing agreements with host countries, OPEC quotas and the loss of projects that were seized by the Venezuelan government. For big oil companies like Exxon, high oil prices have brought huge profits, but have also invited resource-rich countries like Nigeria, Kazakhstan, and Canada to reexamine their contracts with the companies. James Halloran, who helps invest about $35 billion at National City Private Client Group, said these arrangements were cutting into Exxon's international profits. "There's kind of a plateauing of what you can make in international because of production-sharing agreements," Halloran said. "And it's only going to get worse ... There's a trend here, and it's really going to be tough for companies to get a handle on as much of the upside from production as they used to." STILL SEEING DEMAND GROWTH The company's average oil price rose about 12 percent in the U.S. and 9 percent abroad, while its natural gas prices fell 14 percent in the U.S., 3 percent in Europe and 4 percent elsewhere. Exxon's Vice President of Investor Relations Henry Hubble said the company is still seeing some demand growth for its products despite high prices. "The rate of growth is a little bit less than what we've seen in some previous years," Hubble said on a call with reporters. "But basically we're continuing to see year-on-year growth, a lot of that coming in the Asia Pacific market. In the U.S., we're about flat this year." Shares of Exxon fell $2.45 to $89.54 on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday afternoon. Through Wednesday's close, Exxon's shares were up about 20 percent this year, underperforming the Chicago Board Options Exchange's Oil Index .OIX, which rose about 29 percent over the same period.
