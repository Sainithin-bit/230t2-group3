 LONDON  (Reuters) - Unilever Plc/NV, the world's third-biggest food and consumer goods group, met forecasts with a 4.5 percent increase in third-quarter underlying sales and its shares rose on confidence it will meet its 2007 sales and margin targets. 

 Anglo-Dutch Unilever, the maker of Sunsilk shampoo, Knorr soups and Ben & Jerry's ice cream, added that price rises and cost savings helped offset the sharp upswing in the cost of commodities such as edible oils and dairy products. Unilever Plc shares rose 4.6 percent to 16.99 pounds by 5:30 a.m. EDT to be the biggest riser on the UK's benchmark FTSE-100 index . Unilever NV shares were up 4.6 percent at 23.43 euros. "Overall, this was a decent set of results in difficult conditions for food manufacturers," said analyst Michael Steib at brokers Morgan Stanley. Quarterly growth slowed after cool and wet summer weather hit European sales of ice cream brands such as Cornetto and Magnum in the July-September period, compared with the 5.7 and 5.8 percent growth seen in the first and second quarters. However, the 4.5 percent rise was in line with analysts' forecasts of 3.8 to 5.1 percent growth with a consensus of 4.4 percent, and would have been 5.2 percent when adjusted for a systems change in the United States which pulled sales into Q2. Underlying sales grew 5.3 percent in the first nine months. "With the quarterly gyrations the best measure is the 9-month result of 5.3 percent organic growth - a respectable number," said analyst Charlie Mills at brokers Credit Suisse. Unilever, whose 400 brands also include Lipton tea, Hellmann's mayonnaise and Omo detergents, is confident of hitting 2007 targets for underlying sales growth at the upper end of its 3-5 percent range and operating margin above 2006's 13.6 percent. Its operating margin rose to 13.7 percent in the quarter and the nine months, with a quarterly rise of 20 basis points. "Looking forward, I am confident that we will achieve our outlook for 2007, given in August, and that our change program leaves us well placed to deliver our longer term objectives," said Chief Executive Patrick Cescau in a statement. However, analysts pointed out the 13.7 percent operating margin was helped by a 40 basis point cut in advertising and promotional spending as a proportion of sales, and there was a volume slowdown in North America in the quarter. They added that cost pressures have clearly picked up from the second-quarter, but so has pricing as Unilever follows Swiss giant Nestle in raising prices to offset higher costs. Unilever added third-quarter earnings per NV share from total operations rose 38 percent to 0.35 euros ($0.51), compared to a consensus of 0.32 euros and a range of 0.29 to 0.36. The group proposed a first-half dividend of 0.25 euros per Unilever NV share and 17.00 pence per Plc share. In August, the group unveiled plans to cut 20,000 jobs, or just over a tenth of its global workforce, and sell slow-growing businesses such as its North American laundry unit to speed up its recovery and fight surging commodity costs. This forms part of the "One Unilever" program which aims to cut the group's annual cost base by 1.5 billion euros by end-2010 and accelerate margin improvement. Unilever has been steadily recovering from a shock profit warning in 2004, but its underlying sales growth has still generally lagged bigger rivals like U.S. giant Procter & Gamble Co and the world's biggest food group Nestle. Unilever stock trades at 16.7 times forecast 2008 earnings, below both Nestle and Procter & Gamble on 17.6 reflecting Unilever's slower growth prospects, according to Reuters Estimates.
