 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp ( 7203.T ) said on Thursday that its October U.S. sales rose narrowly from a year earlier as stronger showroom traffic in the Midwest and elsewhere offset a slump in California. 

 The Japanese automaker said its overall U.S. sales were up 0.5 percent from a year earlier after adjusting for an additional selling day last month compared with a year earlier. "In Southern California, wildfires crimped a key market already impacted by the housing downturn," said Jim Lentz, Toyota's executive vice president of U.S. sales. California, which has since contained the raging wildfires that drove some 500,000 people from their homes, is a large market for auto sales. Toyota-brand sales were up 0.5 percent. Sales for the company's luxury Lexus unit were up 0.6 percent in the month, Toyota said in a statement. Toyota's truck sales were up 2.8 percent while car sales fell 1.2 percent. Sales of the automaker's Tundra full-size pickup truck were up 71 percent. (Reporting by  Kevin Krolicki )
