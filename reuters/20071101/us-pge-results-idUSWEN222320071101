 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - California utility PG&E Corp ( PCG.N ) on Thursday posted a 29 percent drop in third-quarter earnings, hurt by higher costs to buy electricity. 

 PG&E, parent of Pacific Gas & Electric Co, said net income was $278 million, or 77 cents per share, compared with $393 million, or $1.09 per share, a year ago. Excluding one-time gains that added $83 million to the year-ago earnings, the third quarter earnings slipped 12 percent. It said it now expects to hit the upper half of its 2007 earnings target range of $2.70 to $2.80 per share. It stood by its 2008 earnings outlook of $2.90 to $3.00 per share. The average forecast of analysts had expected $2.78 in 2007 and $3.03 in 2008, according to Reuters Estimates. (Reporting by  Lisa Lee  and  Matt Daily )
