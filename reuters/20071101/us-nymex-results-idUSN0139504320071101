 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Nymex Holdings Inc NMX.N, parent of the New York Mercantile Exchange, posted a better-than-expected quarterly profit on Thursday helped by stronger electronic trading volume and cost-cuts. 

 The world's largest energy futures market unveiled a plan to increase revenue and reduce costs as it migrates from open-outcry floor trading to electronic trading. The New York-based Nymex also approved a special dividend of $100 million. Shares of Nymex rose more than 1 percent in morning trading. As part of the plan, the exchange hopes to bring in $50 million in new revenue by increasing trading and market data fees. Nymex also plans to cut 120 jobs over the next five quarters, with 55 people losing their jobs immediately. The layoffs will save Nymex about $10 million. Nymex, which earlier said it was exploring a sale of its downtown Manhattan headquarters, is retaining real estate broker Cushman & Wakefield to explore a sale. A sale, which could be completed by the end of next year, could result in $12 million in cost savings, Chief Executive James Newsome said on a conference call. Christopher Allen, an analyst at Banc of America Securities, said the cost-cutting plan and special dividend are "positives." These actions would not preclude M&A activity by the company, Allen said in a research note. Nymex said in August it had held potential merger talks with certain parties but did not identify them. Press reports have said NYSE Euronext NYX.N, operator of the New York Stock Exchange, has held deal talks with Nymex. NET INCOME AND REVENUE Net income for the third quarter rose 54 percent to $62.6 million, or 66 cents per share, from $40.7 million, or 47 cents per share. Revenue rose 25 percent to $173.2 million. Analysts were expecting Nymex to earn 64 cents per share on revenue of $172.35 million, according to Reuters Estimates. Average daily volume of contracts traded during the quarter rose 13 percent to 1.5 million. Floor trading of various options and futures contracts continued to decline during the quarter, even as electronic trading drove average daily volume growth. Clearing and transaction fees rose 22 percent to $145.3 million. Nymex said it expects to take a pre-tax charge of about $4 million in the fourth quarter for the cost-cutting initiatives. Nymex shares were up $1.19, or $129.78, on the New York Stock Exchange. The shares have traded between $105 and $150 in the past 52 weeks. (Editing by Steve Orlofsky)
