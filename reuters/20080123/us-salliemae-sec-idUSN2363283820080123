 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Student lending company SLM Corp SLM.Nor Sallie Mae on Wednesday said the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating the company's disclosures and actions in December 2007, before and after executives and directors traded in the stock. 

 Sallie Mae said in an SEC filing that the agency requested the information on January 17. It said it is cooperating with the regulator to provide the requested information and documents. It did not provide more information, such as which company stock sales or which company insiders are the focus of the probe. Sallie Mae on Wednesday posted a fourth-quarter loss, reporting higher provisions for loan losses as a result of weakening credit markets. (Reporting by  Karey Wutkowski , editing by Gerald E.
