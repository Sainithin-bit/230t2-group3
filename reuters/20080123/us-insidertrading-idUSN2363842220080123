 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A former employee of brokerage firm Assent LLC pleaded guilty to conspiracy on Wednesday, admitting he accepted bribes to conceal illegal trades based on inside information supplied by a former employee at UBS AG ( UBSN.VX ). 

 Laurence McKeever, 46, who worked as a compliance officer at Assent in New Jersey, pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy before Judge Loretta Preska in U.S. District Court in Manhattan. He also agreed to forfeit $30,000 as part of the plea agreement with the government, which recommends a sentence of 10 to 16 months. He is scheduled to be sentenced on May 1. The plea is the latest development in what authorities have called one of the most brazen and far-reaching insider trading rings on Wall Street since the 1980s. Prosecutors, working along with the FBI, brought criminal charges against 13 people, including a UBS Securities client manager and a lawyer at Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ), when they announced the case in March 2007. Nine other people have pleaded guilty in the case. The scheme netted more than $8 million in illegal profits, the government contends. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission also brought a civil case. (Reporting by  Paritosh Bansal  and  Martha Graybow ; Editing by  Andre Grenon )
