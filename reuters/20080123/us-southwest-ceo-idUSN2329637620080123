 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Southwest Airlines Co ( LUV.N ), bracing for a slowing U.S. economy, is ready to act should an acquisition opportunity present itself, its chief executive told Reuters on Wednesday. 

 "We'll be prepared, like we have been in the past, to move very quickly if an opportunity arises," Gary Kelly said in a telephone interview. He said the carrier would be open to acquiring a carrier as well as assets such as airport gates that may be spun off by other airlines. Kelly also said that he expects the slowing economy to impair travel demand. "We know the overall economy is slowing. We're expecting that will have an impact on travel demand," said Kelly. "We're not seeing that at Southwest Airlines yet, but we want to be prepared for that." Southwest Airlines earlier posted better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings, helped by its industry-leading fuel hedges. (Reporting by  Chris Reiter ; Editing by Gerald E. McCormick)
