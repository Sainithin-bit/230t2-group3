 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - ConocoPhillips ( COP.N ), the No. 3 U.S. oil company, posted higher fourth-quarter earnings on Wednesday, beating Wall Street expectations on record oil prices. 

 Still, its shares fell more than 3 percent as lower oil prices and fears of a recession weighed on the shares of the entire oil industry. ConocoPhillips said net income rose to $4.37 billion, or $2.71 a share, from $3.2 billion, or $1.91 a share, a year earlier. Analysts said the results included one-time items that boosted earnings by $375 million, or 23 cents a share. Excluding those items, the company earned about $2.48 a share, topping analysts' average forecast of $2.41, according to Reuters Estimates. Oppenheimer analyst Fadel Gheit said Conoco's refining and marketing operations performed better than expected, despite profit margins that withered from near-record levels earlier in the year. "The refining side was a lot better than we had in mind, especially in the U.S.," Gheit said. "They operated their facilities pretty well and they had no major glitches. ... It was a surprisingly strong quarter given the dismal news we've been hearing there." Revenue in the quarter rose nearly 27 percent to $52.7 billion. $100 OIL Oil prices averaged more than $90 a barrel during the quarter, and nearly hit $100 due to tight supplies, geopolitical risks and the weak dollar. Earnings at the company's exploration and production segment rose to $2.61 billion from $2.09 billion a year earlier. Production, excluding its 20 percent stake in Russia's Lukoil ( LKOH.MM ), was 1.84 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd), down 10 percent from last year. The shortfall was due primarily to the loss of projects that were seized by the Venezuelan government, Conoco's exit from operations in Dubai, and unplanned downtime in Nigeria. The company expects production -- excluding Lukoil -- to average about 1.8 million boepd in the first quarter. Profit at its refining and marketing segment rose to $1.12 billion from $919 million. ConocoPhillips' stake in Lukoil yielded profits of $649 million in the quarter, more than doubling the year-earlier contribution. Its share of Lukoil's production was 426,000 barrels per day, down about 3 percent from last year. The Houston-based company said it bought back about $7 billion in shares and expects to repurchase between $2 billion and $3 billion in the first quarter. Robert Goodof, who helps manage $20 billion in equities at Loomis Sayles & Co, said that while the company's production growth has been unimpressive, ConocoPhillips has developed returns to investors through buybacks and dividends. "What I would like to see them do is generate high cash flow and high returns on investment and deliver those returns to investors and that's what these guys are doing," Goodof said. "At $70 a share, they are doing the right things and (the stock is) cheap enough." ConocoPhillips shares were down $2.32, or 3.3 percent, at $68.86 in late morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange. (Reporting by Michael Erman; Editing by  Brian Moss )
