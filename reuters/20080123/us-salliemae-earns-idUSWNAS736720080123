 PHILADELPHIA  (Reuters) - Student lending company Sallie Mae posted a fourth-quarter loss on Wednesday, citing higher provisions for loan losses due to the weakening credit markets. 

 Sallie Mae, legally known as SLM Corp SLM.N, said its loss totaled $1.6 billion, or $3.98 per share, including a $1.5 billion loss on an equity-forward derivatives contract. The loss compared with earnings of $18 million, or 2 cents a share, in the year-ago period. (Reporting by  Jessica Hall , editing by Dave Zimmerman )
