 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Southwest Airlines Co ( LUV.N ) said on Wednesday that quarterly profit nearly doubled on big gains from its industry-leading fuel hedges, beating Wall Street expectations. 

 While the leading U.S. low-cost carrier uniquely benefited from a surge in oil prices, the carrier expressed a "cautious view" on the U.S. economy that could sap travel demand. Its fuel hedges are also gradually unwinding, which will erode the company's advantage over rivals. Southwest's fourth-quarter net profit rose to $111 million, or 15 cents per share, compared with $57 million, or 7 cents per share, a year earlier, as its fuel hedging gain more than doubled. Southwest's gain from its fuel hedging position was $300 million in the quarter, compared to $118 million in the year-ago period. Excluding special items, including gains and losses related to its fuel hedges, Southwest's earnings fell 13 percent to $87 million. Because of a lower share count, adjusted earnings per share were flat at 12 cents per share, ahead of analyst estimates of 10 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Southwest was 90 percent hedged in the fourth quarter at about $51 a barrel. For the first quarter, the company is 75 percent covered also at about $51 a barrel -- still a sizable advantage compared to the current price of about $88 a barrel. Fourth-quarter operating revenue rose 9.5 percent to $2.49 billion, helped by an 5.5 percent increase in fares and a 5.6 percent rise in capacity. Operating expenses rose 12.6 percent, boosted by a 27 percent jump in fuel expenses. In response to its eroding hedge position, Southwest is looking for new ways to boost revenue. The carrier, which last year launched Business Select fares, said it will begin testing in-flight Internet service this summer. Southwest shares, which have lost about a quarter of their value over the last 12 months, closed on Tuesday at $11.98. (Reporting by  Chris Reiter ; Editing by  Derek Caney )
