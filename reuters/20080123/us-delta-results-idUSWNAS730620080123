 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Delta Air Lines Inc ( DAL.N ), the No. 3 U.S. carrier, on Wednesday posted a quarterly net loss on soaring fuel prices. 

 Delta, which emerged from bankruptcy at the end of April, said its loss in the fourth quarter was $70 million, or 18 cents per share, compared with a loss of $1.98 billion in the same period a year earlier, when the company's shares were unlisted and results were affected by reorganization items.
