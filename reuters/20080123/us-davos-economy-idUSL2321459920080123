 DAVOS, Switzerland  (Reuters) - Following are highlights of comments by participants at the World Economic Forum, which begins on Wednesday, on the prospect of an economic slowdown or recession, in the United States and beyond: 

 DAVID MCCORMICK, U.S. UNDERSECRETARY OF THE TREASURY FOR  INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS: (ON SOVEREIGN WEALTH FUNDS) "Our policy starts with the policy that open investment is a critical driver of the U.S. economy." "The questions should be very much around whether that (sovereign wealth fund) investment in future continues to be commercially-driven and in no way shifts to political (drivers)." MICHAEL KLEIN, CHAIRMAN AND CO-CEO, MARKETS AND BANKING,  CITIGROUP (ON SOVEREIGN WEALTH FUNDS) "I think what needs to be quite vigilant is making sure there is a clear understanding, and not the rhetoric that throws the baby out with the bathwater. I would make an argument today that the greatest single benefit to the longevity of the U.S. financial structure is investment made by sovereign wealth funds into (financial institutions)." CHENG SIWEI, VICE CHAIRMAN, STANDING COMMITTEE OF NATIONAL  PEOPLE'S CONGRESS, CHINA "The major problem is how can we find a way to cooperate instead of putting pressure on us on appreciation of RMB (yuan)." "We do not want a big trade surplus, it is a big problem -- please help us ... This year the surplus will go down (because of commodity prices, other pressures)." DAVID MCCORMICK, U.S. UNDERSECRETARY OF THE TREASURY FOR  INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS: "The U.S. economy has sound economic fundamentals. While we continue to believe the U.S. economy will grow, it will grow at a slower pace and there is no doubt downside risks have increased. The housing downturn has proven to be far more significant than initially believed. While the housing market has been primarily in U.S. we have seen signs of challenges elsewhere. In terms of ability of emerging economies to offset (slowdown) in the U.S.... will certainly minimize and lessen the impact of a slowdown in the U.S. economy but not completely. The U.S. remains the 800-pound gorilla in the world economy." FRED BERGSTEN, DIRECTOR OF THE PETERSON INSTITUTE FOR  INTERNATIONAL ECONOMICS: "I believe the world economy has in fact largely decoupled from the U.S. Remember that the emerging markets now account for roughly half the world economy, even if they slow down by half a percent or so, they are still going to provide substantial growth in the 6-7 percent range. Even if the industrial world drops down into 1-2 percent range, world growth will be in 4 percent range That means thinks are much too bleak and pessimistic around here in terms of the outlook." MICHAEL KLEIN, CHAIRMAN AND CO-CEO, MARKETS AND BANKING,  CITIGROUP "The impact of the crisis in August this year was far deeper than regulators, central bankers understood at the time." JOHN STUDZINSKI, HEAD OF U.S. PRIVATE EQUITY FIRM  BLACKSTONE'S ADVISORY BUSINESS (ON THE INTEREST RATE CUT BY THE U.S. FEDERAL RESERVE) "The thing that markets are desperate for right now is leadership, whether globally or regionally, and it seems this is lacking. Until the markets see a lot more leadership on a proactive basis rather than a reactive basis you are going to continue to see this great anxiety and feel this frustration. The Fed is perhaps showing apprehension." STEPHEN ROACH, ASIA HEAD, MORGAN STANLEY: "We have a market-friendly Fed possibly injecting a lot of liquidity in the system which will set us up for another bubble economy. "I'm sort of worried that all they did yesterday was to hit the snooze button...(This is) excessive monetary accommodation that just takes us from bubble to bubble to bubble. "We've got prima facie evidence that we have a central bank that is being goaded into action just by what the markets are doing and...this is going to end in tears. "It's time to put an end to this, what I think is a very reckless way of running American monetary policy. I'm quite astonished that they did what they did yesterday." LOUIS D'AMBROSIO, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF U.S. COMMUNICATIONS  EQUIPMENT COMPANY AVAYA, ON THE ECONOMIC SITUATION: "I do not think it is as bad as some make it out to be...For example, we are not seeing a dramatic change in capital spending right now in the U.S. "Clearly, it's most pronounced in the banking area... but if you look more broadly, globally...you are not seeing the same impact people are writing about... Company earnings and company spending are not reflective of that kind of turmoil." For full coverage, blogs and TV from Davos see:  here (Editing by Sue Thomas)
