 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Student lending company Sallie Mae posted a fourth-quarter loss on Wednesday, citing higher provisions for loan losses due to the weakening credit markets. 

 Sallie Mae, legally known as SLM Corp SLM.N, said its quarterly loss totaled $1.6 billion, or $3.98 per share, including a $1.5 billion loss on an equity-forward derivatives contract. The results also included $575 million in loan-loss provisions. The fourth-quarter loss compared with earnings of $18 million, or 2 cents a share, in the year-ago period. "Our cost of funds and loan loss expectations were impacted by weakening credit markets," said Albert Lord, chief executive officer. Shares of Sallie Mae were down 10.2 percent Wednesday afternoon to $17.08. The student lender's shares had traded as high as $58 in July 2007. Sallie Mae is embroiled in a legal battle with a consortium led by private equity firm J.C. Flowers which last year said it wanted to terminate its agreement to acquire Sallie Mae for $25 billion or $60 a share. Also on Wednesday, Sallie Mae said the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating the company's disclosures and actions in December 2007, before and after executives and directors traded in the stock. Excluding several items, Sallie Mae said its fourth-quarter loss totaled $139 million, or 36 cents a share, compared to net income of $326 million, or 74 cents a share, in the year-ago period. Analysts on average had expected a profit of 55 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. "It's another confirmation of the difficult straits that the company is facing -- it certainly is not comforting from an investor standpoint," said Sean Egan, managing director of independent credit-rating firm Egan-Jones Ratings Inc. ADVERSE Earlier this month, Sallie Mae named banking veteran Anthony Terracciano as chairman and said John Remondi would return to the company as chief financial officer. The appointments were part of the company's efforts to restore credibility after the takeover deal collapsed and Sallie Mae's share price plummeted. The consortium led by J.C. Flowers argued Sallie Mae had suffered a "material adverse change" to its business due to the credit market squeeze and recent legislation that slashes subsidies to student lenders. Sallie Mae disagreed and has filed a lawsuit seeking a breakup fee of $900 million from the consortium. In a conference call on Wednesday, Terracciano said Sallie Mae is taking a close look at its operating expenses and is looking for a chief credit officer -- and that the student lender is still willing to sell itself. Lord told investors that Terracciano has credibility when it comes to selling companies. Sallie Mae said further on Wednesday that student loan originations totaled $5 billion in the fourth quarter and $25.5 billion for the full year 2007. Student loans originated through Sallie Mae's internal brands, the most profitable segment of total student loan originations, grew 27 percent year over year to $16.6 billion, the company said.
