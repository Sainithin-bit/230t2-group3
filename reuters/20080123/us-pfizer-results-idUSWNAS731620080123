 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc ( PFE.N ), the world's biggest drugmaker, on Wednesday reported fourth-quarter results that beat expectations. 

 The company said it earned $2.88 billion, or 42 cents per share. That compared with $9.45 billion, or $1.32 per share, in the year-earlier quarter, when Pfizer reported a big gain from the sale of its consumer health business to Johnson & Johnson ( JNJ.N ). Excluding one-time items, Pfizer earned 52 cents per share. (Reporting by Ransdell Pierson; editing by John Wallace)
