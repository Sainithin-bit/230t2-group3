 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Delta Air Lines Inc ( DAL.N ), the No. 3 U.S. carrier, on Wednesday posted a fourth-quarter net loss on skyrocketing fuel prices that have also hammered its rivals. 

 The company, which emerged from bankruptcy at the end of April, said the loss was $70 million, or 18 cents per share. The results were in line with analysts' expectations, according to Reuters Estimates. Delta had posted a loss of $1.98 billion in the year-earlier period, when its shares were unlisted and results suffered because of reorganization items. Operating revenue rose 10 percent to $4.68 billion, boosted by an increase in passenger revenue. Delta said its fuel costs rose 28 percent to $1.36 billion during the quarter. Following losses at American Airlines parent AMR Corp AMR.N and United Airlines parent UAL Corp UAUA.O, Delta's results underscore the strain on the airline industry's fledgling recovery. With fuel prices near-record levels and concerns that the U.S. economy is heading into recession, airlines are considering mergers in a bid to better weather tough times. Delta is reportedly in merger talks with both Northwest Airlines Corp NWA.N and UAL. The airlines have declined to comment. Delta ended the year with $3.8 billion in unrestricted liquidity.
