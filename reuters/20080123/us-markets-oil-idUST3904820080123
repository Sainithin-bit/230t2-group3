 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Oil tumbled more than 2 percent on Wednesday as persistent worries of a recession in top consumer the United States battered markets. 

 U.S. crude CLc1 fell $1.96 to $87.25 a barrel by 1:35 p.m. EST, after hitting a low of $86.65 earlier. London Brent crude LCOc1 fell $1.57 to $86.88 a barrel. Oil has lost more than $3 this week as world stock markets posted their steepest losses since September 11, 2001, amid widespread concerns that the U.S. credit and housing crisis could trigger a recession and crimp oil demand growth. Some analysts said funds and speculators may be selling off positions in oil and commodities to cover margin calls and finance losses in equity markets. The U.S. stock market fell for a sixth straight day on Wednesday, the day after a surprise interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve pared stock losses. "Oil markets shrugged off yesterday's unexpected (Federal Reserve cut) and focused again on fears of a global economic slowdown and forecasts for growing inventory levels," Addison Armstrong, analyst at TFS Energy, wrote in a research note. But experts said commodity markets were still holding up relatively well as the underlying economic momentum, especially in Asia, remained supportive. "Oil's ability to go down another $10 to $15 from here really depends upon a deteriorating outlook for the economy. We are not going to go down $15 unless the economic outlook starts to look pretty bad," said Francisco Blanch, head of commodity research at Merrill Lynch. While U.S. oil is down almost 13 percent from the all-time peak above $100 a barrel hit January 3, prices are still up more than 60 percent from year-ago levels. Tight inventory levels, OPEC production restraints and strong demand from investors seeking higher returns and a possible hedge against inflation supported oil on its surge. Goldman Sachs said prices could slide into the low $80s if speculators liquidated their long positions, but added strong fundamentals would probably keep funds from selling out completely. A Reuters poll of analysts forecast U.S. weekly government oil inventory data to be released on Thursday would show a 2.2 million barrel gain. Distillates stocks were forecast to show a 100,000 barrel draw, while gasoline stocks were expected to have risen by 1.4 million barrels.
