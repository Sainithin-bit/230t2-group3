 DAVOS, Switzerland  (Reuters) - Key policymakers and corporate executives in Davos moved on Wednesday to quash fears about the influence of state-run investment funds, saying they would contribute to global growth and the sound banking system. 

 Sovereign Wealth Funds, which manage assets of over $2 trillion, are one of the hottest topics at the World Economic Forum as debate rages over whether these cash-rich funds are the saviors of global finance or a threat to economic stability. With their $60 billion cash injection into the ailing U.S. banking sector in recent months, many argue these funds have replaced hedge funds and private equity as the main drivers of the world economy. "The sovereign wealth funds have been acting as investors of last resort, bailing out the financial institutions, and in that respect they've actually been a positive factor in the situation," billionaire financier George Soros told Reuters. However, politicians fear SWFs could invest with political rather than economic motives, gaining control of firms important to national security. OECD Secretary-General Angel Gurria said such protectionist fears are unjustified. "We are now adding protectionism (fears) on SWFs without any evidence that they've done anything wrong so far. We should incorporate them. It's not larger than anything we've been handling so far," he said. "The OECD is saying buyers have to have transparency, abide by market rules. But sellers: don't overreact, don't overregulate, don't overcontrol, don't overlegislate. They are helping investments, solving some of the problems, like global imbalances. They could become sovereign development funds." Last week, sovereign funds from Asia and the Middle East poured $20 billion into Citi and Merrill Lynch as they wrestle with billion dollar writedowns on credit losses. Michael Klein, Chairman and co-CEO of markets and banking in Citi, says wealth funds are the great benefactor of the financial system. "I would make an argument today that the greatest single benefit to the longevity of the U.S. financial structure is investment made by sovereign wealth funds into (financial institutions)," Klein said. David McCormick, Undersecretary of the U.S. Treasury for international affairs, agreed there are upsides. "Open investment is a critical driver of the U.S. economy," he said, adding that investments by sovereign wealth funds were positive for the economy. McCormick added: "The questions should be very much around whether that (sovereign wealth fund) investment in future continues to be commercially-driven and in no way shifts to political (drivers)." TRANSPARENCY The top SWFs now hold around $2.5 trillion in assets and the total size is expected to reach $12 trillion by 2015 -- almost 10 percent of all financial sets in the world. McCormick reiterated Washington's call on the International Monetary Fund to draw up best practices on wealth funds. Klein of Citi said: "I think what needs to be quite vigilant is making sure there is a clear understanding, and not the rhetoric that throws the baby out with the bathwater. Gurria said wealth funds should follow the steps of Norway's state funds. Norway's $380 billion wealth funds are considered as the most transparent government fund. "Norwegian investment funds are good example of good practices. It's their own interest to adopt best practices." John Studzinski, head of U.S. private equity firm Blackstone advisory business, told Reuters: "These are large funds that are run with very sophisticated groups of financial analysts. They have very clear financial parameters. They are very no nonsense, very black and white." For full coverage, blogs and TV from Davos, see:  here
