 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Motorola Inc MOT.N expects a challenging year, with recovery in its money-losing mobile devices business taking longer than expected, Chief Executive Greg Brown said on Wednesday. 

 Brown also told analysts in a conference call that the company would take cost-cutting actions that would create savings of $500 million. (Reporting by  Sinead Carew ; editing by John Wallace)
