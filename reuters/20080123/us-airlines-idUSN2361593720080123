 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Delta Air Lines Inc ( DAL.N ) was dragged to a loss on Wednesday on soaring fuel prices, while Southwest Airlines Co ( LUV.N ) posted better-than-expected profit on its long-term fuel hedging. 

 Delta, the No. 3 U.S. carrier, reported a fourth-quarter loss a few months after exiting bankruptcy, unable to offset a 28 percent rise in its fuel bill. "The business must be recalibrated to this high fuel price environment," Ed Bastian, Delta's chief financial officer, said in a statement. Southwest, the leading U.S. low-cost carrier, benefited from a $300 million gain from its industry-leading fuel hedges to nearly double profits and beat Wall Street expectations. With fears mounting that the U.S. economy is heading toward recession, U.S. airlines have struggled to raise fares to offset higher fuel costs, jeopardizing the industry's fledgling recovery. Two recent attempts to raise fuel surcharges have failed in a sign that consumers are balking at higher fares. "We know the overall economy is slowing. We're expecting that will have an impact on travel demand," Southwest Chief Executive Gary Kelly told Reuters in an interview. "If there is a slowdown that is more dramatic ahead, that's not the time to be raising fares, quite frankly," he said. Delta shares were up 8 cents at $14.93 and Southwest was up 17 cents at $12.15 on the New York Stock Exchange. DELTA EXPOSED Delta, which emerged from bankruptcy at the end of April, said its loss in the fourth quarter was $70 million, or 18 cents per share, in line with Wall Street expectations. The Atlanta-based carrier posted a loss of $1.98 billion in the same period last year, when the company's shares were unlisted and results were affected by reorganization items. Following losses at American Airlines parent AMR Corp AMR.N and United Airlines parent UAL Corp UAUA.O, Delta's results underscore the strain on the airline industry's fledgling recovery. Delta plans to cut domestic capacity by 4 percent to 5 percent this year and is ready "to quickly make further adjustments as the domestic economic outlook warrants," Delta's Bastian said. With fuel prices near record levels and concerns that the U.S. economy is heading into recession, airlines are considering mergers in a bid to better weather tough times. Delta is reportedly in merger talks with both Northwest Airlines Corp NWA.N and United Airlines parent UAL Corp UAUA.O. The airlines have declined to comment. Delta's operating revenue rose 10 percent to $4.68 billion boosted by more international flights, especially across the Atlantic and to Asia. The carrier said 32 percent of its capacity operates in international markets, compared to 23 percent two years ago. SOUTHWEST COVERED Southwest's fourth-quarter net profit rose to $111 million, or 15 cents per share, compared with $57 million, or 7 cents per share, a year earlier, as its fuel hedging gain more than doubled. But excluding special items, including gains and losses related to its fuel hedges, Southwest's earnings fell 13 percent to $87 million. Because of a lower share count, adjusted earnings per share were flat at 12 cents per share, ahead of analyst estimates of 10 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. While fuel hedges have shielded Southwest from rising oil prices, that protection is gradually unwinding, which will erode the company's advantage over rivals. Southwest was 90 percent hedged in the fourth quarter at about $51 a barrel. For the first quarter, the company is 75 percent covered also at about $51 a barrel, but that's still a sizable advantage compared to the current price of about $88 a barrel. In response to its eroding hedge position, Southwest is looking for new ways to boost revenue. The carrier, which last year launched business fares, said it will begin testing in-flight Internet service this summer. CEO Kelly also said the company is ready to make acquisitions if an opportunity presents itself. "We'll be prepared, like we have been in the past, to move very quickly if an opportunity arises," he told Reuters in a telephone interview. Southwest's fourth-quarter operating revenue rose 9.5 percent to $2.49 billion, helped by an 5.5 percent increase in fares and a 5.6 percent rise in capacity. (Editing by Dave Zimmerman)
