 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc ( QCOM.O ) posted a higher quarterly profit on Wednesday due to demand for its mobile phone chips, and its shares rose 6.5 percent. 

 The wireless technology and chip supplier also gave a forecast for the current quarter that was in line with analysts' expectations. "The demand for CDMA-based devices, applications and services continues to accelerate around the world," Chief Executive Paul Jacobs said in a statement. CDMA is a cell phone technology used by Qualcomm and others and it is also used in smart phones. Qualcomm posted a profit of $767 million, or 46 cents a share for the period ended December 30, compared with $648 million, or 38 cents a share in the year-ago quarter. Revenue rose a better-than-expected 21 percent to $2.44 billion. Profit in the quarter before stock-based compensation and other items was 52 cents per share, Qualcomm said in a statement. In December the company forecast adjusted earnings per share of 52 cents to 53 cents and revenue to be at the high end of its previously announced range of $2.3 billion to $2.4 billion. Analysts expected a per-share profit of 53 cents, on average, on revenue of $2.22 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. For the current quarter, San Diego-based Qualcomm forecast earnings per share before items of 50 cents to 52 cents on revenue of $2.4 billion to $2.5 billion. That compares with current analyst estimates of a profit of 52 cents per share on revenue of $2.43 billion. Shares of Qualcomm advanced 6.5 percent to $39 in after-hours trading. In regular Nasdaq trade, the stock fell 29 cents, or less than 1 percent, to close at $36.63. (Reporting by  Duncan Martell )
