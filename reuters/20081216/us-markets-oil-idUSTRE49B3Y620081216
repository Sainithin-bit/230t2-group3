 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Oil fell 2 percent on Tuesday as worries about shrinking global energy demand countered a U.S. Federal Reserve interest rate cut and expectations OPEC will reduce supplies further. 

 Oil ministers from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries were near a consensus to cut output by 2 million barrels per day (bpd), the biggest reduction ever by the producer group, ahead of a meeting in Algeria on Wednesday. Russian officials said the top non-OPEC producer could reduce exports by 320,000 bpd to give greater punch to the cartel's efforts to balance oil markets and prop up prices. U.S. crude settled down 91 cents at $43.60 a barrel, while London Brent crude fell 4 cents to settle at $44.56 a barrel. "All the news is supportive, OPEC and the weak dollar, yet oil coming back off tells you the bears are still in control," said Tom Bentz, analyst at BNP Paribas Commodity Futures Inc. The U.S. Federal Reserve took a radical step to revive the moribund economy, slashing its key interest rate to zero to 0.25 percent, shortly after plummeting consumer prices and record-low housing starts pointed to a prolonged recession. The U.S. dollar tumbled while U.S. stocks rallied after the decision. "The fact that the Fed cut rates by 75 basis points rather than the consensus of 50 points seems to indicate that perhaps the economy needs major, major overhaul that is bigger than expected earlier," said Nauman Barakat, senior vice president at Macquarie Futures USA. "That translates into lower demand for crude oil." Oil prices are drifting just above a four-year trough of $40.50 a barrel hit on December 5 and remain down more than $100 from the July record above $147 a barrel as a financial crisis hits fuel consumption. The market slump has raised alarm bells for OPEC nations and other big producer countries that depend on revenues from energy exports. The producer group expects global demand for its crude oil to fall by an average of 1.4 million bpd next year due to the downturn in the world economy. The drop in demand will be even more dramatic in the first quarter. "In the first quarter of 2009, the demand for OPEC crude is expected to see a sharp drop of 2.3 million bpd from the same quarter in the previous year," it said in its latest monthly report on the oil market. OPEC already has agreed to cut output by 2 million barrels a day at two previous meetings, but demand has fallen faster and stocks of oil are building up. OPEC said 45 million barrels of crude oil are currently being stored at sea on oil tankers. "OPEC won't face a bigger decision than this for some time to come," Bank of Ireland analyst Paul Harris said. "If they don't put a floor under prices with a cut of some significance then it could have huge ramifications for the future of the oil market," he added. Crude oil stocks in top energy consumer the United States are running near the top of the five-year range and forecasters expect data to show they rose by another 300,000 barrels last week, according to a Reuters' poll ahead of the U.S. fuel inventory report due on Wednesday.
