 AMSTERDAM  (Reuters) - Most Dutch financial firms, including ING, Rabobank and Aegon, as well as two major pension funds, said on Tuesday they had little or no exposure to Bernard Madoff's investment management business. 

 The main exception was the Dutch banking unit of Fortis, recently nationalized by the Dutch government, which said on Monday it may have a loss of up to 1 billion euros ($1.4 billion) due to loans made to funds that invested in Madoff Securities. New York-based Madoff Securities hedge fund is at the center of an alleged $50 billion fraud, where in an alleged Ponzi scheme, returns were generated by adding new investors, eventually leading to the fund collapsing under its own weight. Britain's HSBC Holdings said on Monday it had exposure of around $1 billion, joining a list of other European banks that includes Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc and Grupo Santander. RBS now operates the wholesale banking activities of ABN AMRO, which was bought up by RBS, Fortis and Santander last year. Fortis, which acquired ABN's Dutch activities, was split up and sold to the Dutch government and BNP Paribas in October after losing the confidence of investors and clients. An ABN spokesman said that any exposure to Madoff by ABN AMRO's Dutch business was already included in Monday's announcement by RBS. RBS said its potential losses from the investments could total as much as 400 million pounds ($609.3 million). Bank and insurer ING said that neither it or its investment management arm had direct exposure to Madoff. Some private banking clients did invest with Madoff, but the total exposure was insignificant, an ING spokesman said. Representatives for unlisted Rabobank and insurer Aegon said they had no exposure to Madoff investments. Dutch insurance and banking group SNS Reaal said it had 'minimal' exposure to Madoff Securities, but declined to specify the amount or other details. Dutch pension funds ABP and PFZW, and insurer Eureko, had no exposure to Madoff, spokespeople for the groups said. Pension asset manager Mn Services had some indirect exposure and did not expect it to be big, an Mn Services spokesman said. Smaller Dutch KAS Bank said, however, that it had 9 million euros in exposure to Madoff's investment management fund.
