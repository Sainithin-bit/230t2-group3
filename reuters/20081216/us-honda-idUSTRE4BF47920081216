 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Honda Motor Co ( 7267.T ), which has abruptly moved up its year-end news conference by two days, could announce its third profit warning of the year on Wednesday as the market conditions worsen. 

 Japan's No.2 automaker is expected to cut its annual group operating profit forecast to about 300 billion yen ($3.33 billion), a drop of about 70 percent from a year earlier, the Nikkei financial daily reported. This would be about 200 billion yen lower than the company's prior forecast in October. Kyodo news agency also reported that Honda was making final preparations to sharply lower its profit estimate for the year ending March 31. Honda also has abandoned plans to sell its luxury Acura brand in Japan and will postpone or curtail other domestic capital spending, the Nikkei said without citing sources. Honda Executive Vice President Koichi Kondo told Reuters last month the automaker's profit forecasts for the business year to March 2009 would have to be revised, saying that meeting them would be a "Herculean task" in light of tanking vehicle sales around the world. Tokyo Stock Exchange rules stipulate that listed companies must swiftly announce any changes to guidance if the new profit figure is off by more than 30 percent, or revenue by more than 10 percent. Honda declined to comment on the possibility of a profit forecast revision. It did not give a reason for the abrupt change in plan, which was announced with one day's notice. A source with knowledge of the situation said the board of directors was set to meet on Wednesday. The news conference, to be attended by Chief Executive Takeo Fukui and other executives, is now set for 3 p.m. (1 a.m. EST) on Wednesday. Many companies announce earnings results and forecast revisions at 3 p.m. to coincide with the close of stock trading in Tokyo. Honda was originally scheduled to hold the annual year-end news conference on Friday morning. SCALING BACK Honda also canceled Fukui's presentation to sector analysts on Friday and instead scheduled an investor relations meeting on "management strategy" with Executive Vice President Kondo on Wednesday evening in Tokyo. As part of its clampdown on capital spending, Honda will consider delaying the opening of a plant in Saitama Prefecture, near Tokyo, which was scheduled to begin production in 2010 and will scale back spending on that plant and on a neighboring engine factory, the Nikkei said. Other production and distribution adjustments are also being planned, it said. "We think the company is likely to explain specific details and implications of its management policy going forward as it seeks to respond to the changes in its business environment since October," JPMorgan auto analyst Takaki Nakanishi wrote in a note to clients. "In addition to plans to cope with the changing environment going forward, we think the time is right for management to explain its operating projections in light of the change in the climate for earnings," he added. Last week, Honda said it would cut another 119,000 units from planned production in North America through March, less then a month after announcing cuts of nearly 80,000 units on three continents. In a further and perhaps bigger blow, the Japanese currency has strengthened to 13-year highs, trading below 90 yen in Europe on Tuesday. Honda, which has set its dollar assumption at 100 yen for the October-March second half, says every 1-yen swing in the dollar affects annual operating profit by about 20 billion yen ($220 million). On October 28, Honda lowered its earnings forecasts for this business year by 13 percent at the operating level, much tamer than the profit warnings given subsequently by rivals Nissan Motor Co ( 7201.T ) and Toyota Motor Corp ( 7203.T ). Honda shares closed down 5.4 percent at 2,085 yen on Tuesday. (Additional reporting by  Ted Kerr  in New York; Editing by  Andre Grenon )
