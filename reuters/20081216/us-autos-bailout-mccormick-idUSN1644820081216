 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The U.S. government is still studying how to aid the ailing Big 3 automakers with cash earmarked for banks, officials said on Tuesday, giving no hints that a rescue was imminent. 

 David McCormick, Treasury under secretary for international affairs, told CNBC television the $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program was designed to help the financial sector ride out a global credit crisis, not shore up car companies. "Conditions change, and Congress was not able to come together and move forward on a package ... which was certainly the preference the administration had. And so we're put in a situation where we have to consider a range of options," he said, but gave no further details. Demand for cars has collapsed as the country slipped into recession after the collapse of its housing market inflicted savage losses on banks and forced the government to put hundreds of billions of dollars of taxpayer money at risk. The White House has said that it might use TARP money to help General Motors Corp, Ford Motor Co and Chrysler LLC. A $14 billion lifeline for the companies backed by Democrat lawmakers and President George W Bush was killed by Republicans in the U.S. Senate last week. "We are moving with all deliberate speed in order to try to do this in an orderly fashion, but we're not going to be rushed into it," White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said. "We're trying to do something that's responsible." U.S. lawmakers have said that the White House could act as early as Wednesday but the White House said that it would not be rushed into a decision and no announcement was imminent. Governments are rushing to support car manufacturers struggling to cope with falling sales and difficulties shifting their stocks of unsold vehicles. Data on Tuesday showed that European new car sales dropped by a quarter in November. France has said it was ready to take action following a meeting with top industry executives in return for commitments to keep production in the country. But French Economy Minister Christine Lagarde signaled that she still needed convincing. "Clearly, there are lots of collaterals from the automotive sector here in Europe that are acceptable for central banks through the regular banking channels, and the automotive sector has to use all available tools," she told CNBC television. Collateral is the term for any asset used as security for a loan that a lender could sell to get the money back if the borrower defaults on the debt. "I'm not sure that they've used all appropriate tools yet and explored completely the range of collaterals that they can use to procure credit. But we will remain extremely attentive to that sector," said Lagarde, speaking from Paris. U.S. car-makers are in particular peril because the country has been in recession for a year already and because they have struggled to build vehicles that enough Americans want to buy. "We're in a world of difficult choices ... (Treasury) Secretary (Henry) Paulson has said very recently the failure of an automotive company is a very unattractive option. And so we need to consider a range of options to try to address that situation," McCormick said.
