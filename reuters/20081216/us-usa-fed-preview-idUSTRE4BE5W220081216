 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates to close to zero on Tuesday and may point to further unconventional steps to battle a year-old recession. 

 As signs mounted that the United States may be facing a deep and protracted downturn, Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke said on December 1 that the Fed could purchase longer-term securities issued by the U.S. Treasury or government-sponsored agencies to lower yields and stimulate demand. He also said the central bank could sidestep institutions that are reluctant to lend and pump money directly into specific markets, as it has done in the commercial paper market. The Fed's rate decision is expected around 2:15 p.m. EST on Tuesday at the end of a meeting that was extended to two days to allow officials to discuss steps they could take to fight recession even as interest rates drop near zero. A Reuters poll conducted on December 5 found that U.S. primary dealers expect the central bank to cut rates by at least half a percentage point. A half-point rate cut would take the target for the overnight federal funds rate down to just 0.5 percent, the lowest on records dating to July 1954. Following are some factors policy-makers are considering: ECONOMY In his December 1 speech, Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke said the economy was still under "considerable stress" and had slipped further since markets crumbled anew in September. Here are some recent data points on the economy: -- The U.S. unemployment rate hit 6.7 percent in November, the highest since 1993, as employers axed more than half a million jobs, the most since 1974. -- The U.S. economy shrank at a 0.3 percent annual rate in the third quarter, its sharpest contraction in seven years as consumers cut spending and businesses reduced investment in the face of rising fears that recession was setting in. The third-quarter contraction in gross domestic product was the sharpest since the corresponding quarter in 2001. -- The Institute for Supply Management's index of national factory activity fell to 36.2 in November from 38.9 in October, the weakest since 1982. -- The Reuters/University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers said its index of confidence for December rose to 59.1 from November's 55.3, helped by falling gasoline prices, retail discounts and tumbling inflation expectations. -- The housing market has continued to weaken. Construction starts on new U.S. homes fell to a record low in October and the pace of both existing and new home sales also dropped. Many analysts believe losses in the financial sector will continue to mount until the housing market recovers. -- The National Bureau of Economic Research, the private-sector arbiter of U.S. business cycles, said on December 1 the economy had fallen into recession in December 2007. DEFLATION THREAT? Recent reports on inflation and unprecedented signals from bond markets have sparked talk of a return to Great Depression-style deflation, when falling prices discouraged spending and investment. But policy-makers have played down the threat. -- Yields on some U.S. Treasury bills briefly turned negative last week for the first time since 1940, meaning investors effectively paid the government to look after their cash. -- The Consumer Price Index plunged 1 percent in October, its biggest drop since the Labor Department began monthly records in 1947, pulled down by a record drop in energy prices. Core prices, excluding food and energy items, fell 0.1 percent, the first fall in more than a quarter of a century. -- One-year inflation expectations fell to 1.7 percent, their lowest since July 2003, from 2.9 percent in November, according to the Reuters/University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers. It was the biggest drop in one-year inflation expectations since November 2005. NEW CENTRAL BANK STEPS AND MARKET REACTION Since the Fed's last meeting in October, it has announced two new liquidity programs aimed at making it easier for U.S. consumers to obtain loans for homes, cars and on credit cards. -- On November 25, the Fed said it will buy up to $100 billion of debt issued by government-sponsored mortgage enterprises Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the Federal Home Loan Banks and up to $500 billion of mortgage securities backed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and Ginnie Mae. Since then, conditions in the agency market have improved. -- The Fed also teamed with the Treasury Department to launch a $200 billion facility to support consumer finance, including student, auto, and credit card loans and loans backed by the federal Small Business Administration. -- Under heavy intervention from the Fed, short-term U.S. corporate borrowing rose for a seventh straight week last week in a sign that a key financing market was getting back on its feet. But the programs' cost contributed to a record $2.2 trillion of liabilities on the Federal Reserve's balance sheet. BANKS, AUTOS IN CRISIS There were more twists in the financial crisis: -- On November 23, the U.S. government threw a financial lifeline to Citigroup Inc, agreeing to shoulder most of the potential losses on $306 billion of high-risk assets in its biggest bank rescue yet. -- And the U.S. auto industry's survival hangs in the balance after a measure that sought to avert a possible bankruptcy by one or more of the nation's Big Three automakers collapsed in the U.S. Senate. Bernanke told lawmakers in a letter made public on Tuesday that the Fed would be reluctant to lend to automakers, particularly if Congress had decided against a bailout for the sector. Now, the industry is hoping the Treasury Department taps a $700 billion financial rescue fund to aid them. (Reporting by Kristina Cooke; Editing by  Jonathan Oatis )
