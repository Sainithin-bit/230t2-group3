 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co ( F.N ) has no short-term liquidity problems but is hopeful that the Bush administration will take action on requests for emergency funds from the U.S. automakers. 

 Speaking at a Ford event in Dearborn, Michigan, Mark Fields, who heads the company's operations in the Americas, said that the automaker's sales for the first half of December were at "about the same level" as in October and November. Fields also said that Ford is looking at strategic options for its Volvo unit, but declined to comment on whether the company is talking to other automakers about a possible sale. "(This process) will play out of the next couple of months," Fields said. (Reporting by  Poornima Gupta , writing by Nick Carey, editing by Gerald E. McCormick)
