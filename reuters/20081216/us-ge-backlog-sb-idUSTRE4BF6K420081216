 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - General Electric Co ( GE.N ) Chief Executive Jeff Immelt told investors on Tuesday that it is likely the spreading global recession will affect some orders in its backlog. 

 "It's not like every unit in backlog is going to be shipped, but it's great to come into this with a $170 billion backlog," Immelt said. The U.S. conglomerate is briefing investors on its 2009 profit outlook on Tuesday. (Reporting by  Scott Malone , editing by Gerald E. McCormick)
