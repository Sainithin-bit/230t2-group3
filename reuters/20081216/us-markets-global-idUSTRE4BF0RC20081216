 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A record drop in U.S. consumer prices spurred deflation worries on Tuesday, sending down the dollar and oil as well as yields on government bonds, with those for long-dated Treasury debt hovering near historic lows. 

 Rising European and U.S. stocks pared bids for cash and safe haven investments like U.S. government debt ahead of a widely expected interest rate cut in the afternoon by Federal Reserve policy-makers. Oil prices slipped as lingering worries about shrinking global energy demand offset expectations that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will agree to cut supply when members meet on Wednesday in Algeria. In the United States, the Fed is widely expected to trim key short-term rates by at least half a percentage point from 1 percent. The central bank's Federal Open Market Committee will announce its decision at about 2:15 p.m.. Hopes of more help from the Fed helped lift equity markets, with major U.S. stock indexes climbing more than 1 percent and European indices closing up almost 1 percent. Government reports again showed the U.S. economy losing ground, as consumer prices for November plummeted a record 1.7 percent and groundbreaking on new homes fell to a record low. "I think we're in a deflationary spiral that will probably go on until sometime next year," said Thomas di Galoma, head of U.S. Treasury trading at Jefferies & Co. in New York. Benchmark 10-year Treasury notes were up 4/32 in price to yield 2.53 percent, after earlier setting a fresh five-decade low of 2.47 percent. The 30-year U.S. Treasury bond briefly hit a historic low of 2.92 percent. U.S. and European stocks rose after a smaller-than-feared loss from Goldman Sachs boosted the beaten-down financial sector. In Europe BNP Paribas ( BNPP.PA ) and Axa ( AXAF.PA ) each rose about 5 percent, while Dow components JPMorgan ( JPM.N ) and Citigroup ( C.N ) gained 5.2 percent and 6.5 percent. Goldman Sachs posted its first quarterly loss since going public nine years ago, but some investors had expected even deeper losses and its shares rose 10.8 percent on Wall Street. "Everyone had been expecting this to be the proverbial kitchen sink quarter for Goldman -- they were going to throw as much of the nonsense as they could possibly find into this quarter," said Tim Smalls, head of U.S. stock trading at brokerage firm Execution LLC in Greenwich, Connecticut. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  was up 108.96 points, or 1.27 percent, at 8,673.49. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  gained 15.42 points, or 1.78 percent, at 883.99. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  jumped 36.09 points, or 2.39 percent, at 1,544.43. The FTSEurofirst 300  .FTEU3  index of top European shares closed up 0.9 percent at 834.84 points. Defensive stocks were some of the best European gainers, with Sanofi-Aventis ( SASY.PA ) up 3.3 percent, the No. 2 boost to the FTSEurofirst index, and GlaxoSmithKline ( GSK.L ) up 1.7 percent. Electricite de France ( EDF.PA ) was the top-weighted gainer, up 3.1 percent after reports said it is close to buying half of the nuclear assets of Constellation Energy Group CEG.N for $4.5 billion. CEG gained 2 percent. "The investment universe is still being driven by the economic news from the U.S.," said Henk Potts, strategist at Barclays Stockbrokers in London. "Data continues to disappoint. Markets are hoping for action from the incoming president, Barack Obama." The dollar fell to a new two-month low against the euro, spurred by the bleak housing data and expectations the Fed will cut interest rates. The dollar fell against a basket of major currencies, with the U.S. Dollar Index .DXY down 0.75 percent at 81.486. Against the yen, the dollar fell 0.79 percent at 90.01. The euro rose 0.78 percent at $1.3818. Many members of OPEC are calling for output cuts of up to 2 million barrels per day, but the potential for deep cuts was not enough to lift crude prices. "The market may be calling OPEC's bluff," said Stephen Schork, editor at the Schork Report in Philadelphia. U.S. light sweet crude oil fell 36 cents to $44.15 a barrel. Spot gold prices fell $1.15 to $837.40 an ounce. The MSCI index of Asia-Pacific stocks outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS edged up 0.4 percent, but Japan's Nikkei average  .N225  fell 1.1 percent as the yen's strength against the dollar hurting shares of exporters.
