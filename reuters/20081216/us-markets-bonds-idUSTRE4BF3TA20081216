 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury debt prices soared on Tuesday, pushing benchmark note yields down to fresh five-decade lows, after the Federal Reserve cut its benchmark interest rates to near zero and vowed to extend its quantitative easing measures. 

 In an unprecedented move, the Fed cut its target for overnight interest rates to a target of zero to 0.25 percent, the lowest on record. "The decision is setting the Treasury market rallying because of a more dramatic move than the market expected," said Haag Sherman, co-founder and managing director of Salient Partners in Houston, Texas. "The Fed has been sending a message it will throw everything it has at deflation," and Tuesday's aggressive rate cut and policy statement reinforced that message, he said. The benchmark 10-year Treasury note's price jumped more than two full points in price, pushing its yield down to about 2.26 percent the lowest since 1951 according to Global Financial Data and down from 2.52 percent late Tuesday. "Markets just went nuts, not only because of the cut in interest rates," said Bryan Taylor, chief economist with Global Financial Data in Los Angeles. "It was the comments that they made that really jolted both bonds and equities," he said. The 3-month Treasury bill rate, which had traded near zero earlier this week, edged up to 2 basis points, suggesting that the extremely intense safe haven bid for ultra short-dated government instruments had eased very slightly. The Fed's aggressive monetary easing measures partly aim to encourage investors away from the haven of government bills into riskier assets to help revive those lending markets, analysts said. "There were a number of questions that traders had about what the Fed was able and willing to do to address the current liquidity problems in the market. In the statement they addressed those questions directly now that rates are basically down to zero," Taylor said. "Because the private sector isn't there to provide the lending that they normally should, the Fed is stepping in and playing that role," Taylor said. "Probably the best model for this is Japan during the 1990s," he said. In the 1990s the Bank of Japan lowered its benchmark rate to zero to counter deflation and a long recession. "The focus of the Committee's policy going forward will be to support the functioning of financial markets and stimulate the economy through open market operations and other measures that sustain the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet at a high level," said the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee in its accompanying statement. As well as its previously announced measures to buy mortgage-related securities to support the housing market, "the Committee is also evaluating the potential benefits of purchasing longer-term Treasury securities," the statement said. The 30-year Treasury bond's price rose more than two full points, pushing its yield down to new record lows below 2.74 percent, versus 2.97 percent late Monday. "What the Fed has said basically here is that interest rates are no longer relevant: we will set it essentially at zero and from here on out we will purchase whatever securities we think are needed to get the credit markets going again and get the economy going again," said Bruce McCain, Chief Investment Strategist, Key Private Bank, Cleveland, Ohio. Earlier on Tuesday, government data showed a sharp pullback in commodity prices and consumer spending led to a record 1.7 percent drop in the Consumer Price Index. The plunge in CPI, together with a double-digit decline in housing starts last month, had already reinforced the bond market's view the Fed will take more aggressive measures to pull the United States out of its year-old recession, traders said.
