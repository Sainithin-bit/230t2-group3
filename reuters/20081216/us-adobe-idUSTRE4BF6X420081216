 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Adobe Systems Inc ( ADBE.O ) posted quarterly results on Tuesday and an earnings target in line with its reduced forecast from earlier this month, sending its shares up 10.7 percent. 

 Adobe, maker of Acrobat Reader, Flash and Photoshop software, posted results for the fiscal fourth-quarter ended November 28 at the top end of its forecast earlier this month, when it announced lay-offs of 600 people and lowered expectations. Revenue rose to $915.3 million from $911.2 million. Fourth-quarter net income rose to $245.9 million or 46 cents per share from $222.2 million or 38 cents a year earlier. Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter were 60 cents, at the top end of its earlier forecast. Adobe had forecast fiscal first-quarter earnings would be between 43 cents and 47 cents per share, in line with the Reuters Estimate average of 45 cents. The company kept its revenue forecast for the fiscal first quarter ending in February to the range it set earlier this month, between $800 million and $850 million. Earlier in the month, the company said its change in revenue was pegged to weaker-than-expected demand for its new Creative Suite 4 family of products, which began shipping in the quarter, as the main cause of the revenue shortfall. CS4 is a package of tools for graphic designers that includes Photoshop photo-editing software, 3-D computer drawing program Illustrator, Dreamweaver for designing websites and Soundbooth for audio-editing. Shares of the San Jose, California-based company closed the regular session at $22.32, up 0.96 cents or 4.49 percent. After hours they rose to 24.71. (Reporting by  David Lawsky )
