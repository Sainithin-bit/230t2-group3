 MADRID  (Reuters) - The European Central Bank is completely open to any rate decision, Governing Council member and Bank of Spain Governor Miguel Angel Fernandez Ordonez said on Monday. 

 "On the next meeting, I think (ECB President Jean-Claude) Trichet has made it very clear that it is completely open," Ordonez told a seminar in Madrid on relations between Spain and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). "And when he says that, rates may be maintained, they may be cut, they may be cut by some amount or other, it all depends somewhat on how inflation turns out." Speaking at the same conference, IMF head Dominique Strauss-Kahn said he did not see any immediate risk of global deflation. "I won't say the possibility is zero... but I don't see immediately the risk of inflation becoming a deflation risk," he said. Falling inflationary pressures due to the drop in crude prices and lower food price growth meant attention had moved to stimulating growth, he said. "Certainly inflation is less than a few months ago and that's why there's some room for fiscal expansion...The question today is more of a question of growth and output than inflation," he said.
