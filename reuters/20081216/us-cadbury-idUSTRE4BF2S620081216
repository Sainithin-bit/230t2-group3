 LONDON  (Reuters) - British confectionery giant Cadbury CBRY.L on Tuesday warned of slower growth and retailer destocking as the economic downturn starts to bite into the chocolate eating and gum chewing habits of consumers. 

 The London-based company, maker of Dairy Milk chocolate, Trident gum and Halls cough drops, said that with weakening economic conditions in the fourth quarter, some markets like continental Europe and North America were seeing slower growth. "Consumers are still eating more chocolate and chewing more gum, but not across as many markets," said Chief Executive Todd Stitzer on a conference call after a trading update. He highlighted "softening" in North America with underlying revenue growth of around 5 percent in the fourth quarter after near 10 percent growth in recent years, while its key French and Spanish gum markets in Europe had shown some declines. Overall, the group reiterated that it expects 2008 revenue growth to be at the top end of its target range of 4 percent to 6 percent, and to see higher margins this year. But this disappointed some analysts who had looked for 7 percent growth after Cadbury reported a similar revenue rise for the first nine months of 2008 as it pushed through big price rises for its chocolate, candy and chewing gum. Cadbury shares dipped 2.3 percent to 544 pence by 6:03 a.m. EST in a UK market up 0.5 percent. The shares had outperformed the FTSE 100  .FTSE  by 20 percent and traded in line with DJ Euro food and beverage industry .SX3P so far this year. "With nine-month 2008 sales up 7 percent, we had hoped for an upgrade on at least the revenue line," said analyst Jeff Stent at brokers Citi. Credit Suisse analyst Charlie Mills added, "Taken literally a 6 percent organic growth rate suggests a slower fourth quarter since the group was running at 7 percent after nine months." Cadbury's Stitzer called trading "reasonably robust" but admitted that, "Consumers in Europe are journeying out less frequently and this is reflected in a more conservative attitude from our retail customer," he added. He reiterated that the group expects a 6 percent to 8 percent rise in input costs for 2009 and remained committed to delivering its mid-teen percentage margin target by 2011 and looked to make further progress toward that goal in 2009. Cadbury is looking to match market forecasts for 2008 operating margins and see a 130 basis percentage points rise to 11.1 percent compared with 2007's margin of 9.8 percent. The group also announced that Andrew Bonfield will take over as chief financial officer (CFO) from Ken Hanna when he retires in April 2009. Bonfield, 46, was most recently CFO at U.S. pharmaceuticals group Bristol-Myers Squibb ( BMY.N ). Bonfield comes with 10 years' experience as a CFO including 8 years at two of the world's biggest drugs groups, Bristol-Myers and also SmithKline Beecham before it merged with Glaxo. He was also director of finance at gas and oil producer BG Group ( BG.L ). Cadbury also confirmed its widely-rumored intention to sell its Australian beverage business, which has annual sales of 300 million pounds of brands like Schweppes, Cottee's and Solo, and is valued by analysts at around 400 million pounds. Cadbury's broker and adviser UBS ( UBSN.VX ) is conducting the sale, with Cadbury saying there has been "sufficient interest." Cadbury, which spun off its North American beverage business Dr Pepper Snapple ( DPS.N ) in May, lost its crown as the world's largest confectionery group when U.S.-based Mars completed its takeover of chewing gum group Wrigley earlier this month.
