 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Maurice "Hank" Greenberg, former American International Group ( AIG.N ) boss, has questioned whether a Federal Reserve Bank of New York fund, charged with taking on some of the troubled insurer's toxic holdings, paid the right price for some packaged debt securities. 

 Greenberg, a top private shareholder of the insurer, wrote a letter to Chief Executive Edward Liddy in which he said he is interested in knowing more about a sale of $39.3 billion of assets to the fund, announced by the company on Monday. In the transaction, the fund bought securities held by the insurer's counterparties. Greenberg refers in the letter to reports the CDOs were purchased by the fund at face value, and notes the securities had likely been marked down by the counterparties. He added that AIG had marked the CDOs down to about 50 percent of face value. "It certainly seems it was very good for the counterparties," wrote Greenberg in the letter. The fund, Maiden Lane II, was created to hold mortgage liabilities from an AIG securities lending portfolio that caused huge losses to the troubled insurer, the company said in a press release on Monday. The New York Fed extended a loan to Maiden Lane II to enable the purchase of the securities for $19.8 billion. (Reporting by  Elinor Comlay ; Editing by Steve Orlofsky)
