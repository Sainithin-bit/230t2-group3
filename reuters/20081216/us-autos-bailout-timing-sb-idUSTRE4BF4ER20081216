 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The White House on Tuesday said it would not be rushed into a bailout for ailing U.S. automakers, and that no decision had been made and no announcement was imminent. 

 "We are moving with all deliberate speed in order to try to do this in an orderly fashion, but we're not going to be rushed into it," White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said. "We're trying to do something that's responsible." The White House and Treasury have been reviewing financial data from the automakers in considering options for a bailout, including possibly tapping the $700 billion package intended to rescue Wall Street firms from the financial downturn. Perino emphasized that the auto industry and its investors would have to make concessions as part of any government bailout. "We need them to become viable, competitive firms in the future, and in order to do that, concessions are going to have to be made by stakeholders," she said.
