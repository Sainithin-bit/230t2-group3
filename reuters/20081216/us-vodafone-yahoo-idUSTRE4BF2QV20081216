 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Former Vodafone Group Chief Executive Arun Sarin has decided not to pursue the CEO job at Yahoo, the Financial Times reported, citing people close to him. 

 Yahoo had been interested in having Sarin succeed Jerry Yang, according to those people, the Financial Times wrote on Monday, but Sarin is expected to say he does not want the job. Sarin is looking at alternative roles at other U.S. public companies as well as at a private equity firm, the Financial Times wrote, citing those people as saying. Yang said in November that he would step down as chief executive as soon as Yahoo's board finds a replacement. The Financial Times quoted Yahoo as saying the company does not comment on rumors or speculation. (Reporting by  Phil Wahba ; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn)
