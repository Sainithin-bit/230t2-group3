 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Several U.S. manufacturers either cut their profit forecasts or announced job cuts on Tuesday, citing deteriorating economic conditions in their home market and in markets around the world. 

 Diversified manufacturer Eaton Corp ( ETN.N ) slashed its profit outlook for the fourth quarter and warned that the global economic crisis could push gross domestic product in its end-markets down by around 7 percent in 2009. The Cleveland-based company said it now expects operating earnings per share for the fourth quarter, excluding charges related to the integration of recent acquisitions, within a range of $1.00 to $1.10 -- down dramatically from its last forecast on October 20 of a range from $1.70 to $1.80. Eaton said it expects net earnings per share in a range from 90 cents to $1.00. Wall Street analysts' average forecast has been for $1.69 per share for the quarter. "We expect weak global economic conditions to persist throughout 2009," Eaton said in a statement. Johnson Controls Inc ( JCI.N ), one of the world's largest auto parts makers, said that it expects a loss for its first quarter ending December 31 and withdrew its earnings outlook for 2009, citing the rapid decline in global automotive production and an uncertain outlook for the industry. "Every region of the world is down by a double-digit rate, with virtually every automotive customer affected," Chief Executive Stephen Roell said in a statement. "The ongoing uncertainties and rapid changes in the automotive industry make it difficult to provide meaningful financial guidance for the upcoming year." In late October, Milwaukee-based Johnson Controls said it expected to earn between $1.95 per share and $2.10 per share in its fiscal 2009 year. Wall Street analysts had predicted earnings per share for the year of $1.78. The company also cut its estimate for 2009 vehicle production in North America to 9.3 million from its previous forecast on October 14 of 12.3 million vehicles. Johnson Controls also reduced its estimate for European vehicle production to 16.2 million units from 21.2 million. Two U.S. auto suppliers filed for bankruptcy. Key Plastics LLC, a maker of plastic components for cars and trucks, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection as a sharp decline in vehicle demand caused it to default on debt payments. Auto parts maker Special Devices Inc SPDII.UL also filed for bankruptcy protection. Industrial gas supplier Air Products and Chemicals Inc ( APD.N ) said it will cut 1,300 jobs, or about 7 percent of its global workforce, in response to weak economic conditions and falling sales. "This is clearly one of the weakest business environments we have seen across our end-markets," Chief Executive Officer John McGlade said in a statement. A notable exception on Tuesday was diversified manufacturer ITT Corp ( ITT.N ), which stood by its 2008 profit outlook and recommended that the company's board raise ITT's dividend by 22 percent. The maker of pumps, filters and military electronics backed its previously lowered 2008 profit forecast of $3.97 per share to $4.03 per share, excluding special items. ITT had reduced its outlook to that range in October, when it said it planned to cut jobs and ramp up restructuring in the face of a souring economy and unfavorable exchange rates. "Given the challenging global economic environment that has worsened in recent months, we have taken a number of proactive measures to better position the company to weather the anticipated difficult year ahead," CEO Steve Loranger said in a statement. In trade near midday on the New York Stock Exchange, Eaton shares were down $1.64 or 3.7 percent at $42.27, while Johnson Controls dipped 55 cents or 3 percent to $17.77. ITT was up $1.71 or 4 percent at $44.06, while Air Products shares rose $1.29 or 2.7 percent to $49.83. (Editing by Gerald E. McCormick)
