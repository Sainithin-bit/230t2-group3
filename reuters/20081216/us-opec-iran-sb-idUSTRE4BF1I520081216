 TEHRAN  (Reuters) - Iran's oil minister said market stability could be restored if OPEC decides to cut output by between 1.5 and 2 million barrels per day at its meeting in Algeria on Wednesday, the official IRNA news agency reported. 

 Oil Minister Gholamhossein Nozari said on Sunday Iran would propose such a production cut when the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries meets in the North African country. "A cut of 1.5 to 2 million barrels a day of OPEC's oil can restore stability to the oil market and can keep its price at a suitable level," Nozari was quoted on Tuesday as telling IRNA. OPEC ministers are expected to announce an output cut at the Algeria talks to shore up prices that have plunged about $100 a barrel since a July peak. OPEC deferred an output cut decision at a meeting in Cairo last month. OPEC delegates said Saudi Arabia and its Gulf allies demanded tighter adherence to existing curbs, with some fingering Iran. Tehran says it is sticking to its commitments. OPEC's recent output curbs amount to about 2 million bpd, including a cut agreed in October and effective November 1 of 1.5 million bpd. Iran, which is the OPEC's second-biggest producer, was to reduce its output by 199,000 bpd under the November move. Nozari told IRNA that Iran had cut its production by this amount and was now producing 3.89 million bpd. "The Islamic Republic of Iran has been producing as per OPEC's approval and it is following its decisions," Nozari said, according to IRNA. "In all, the organization members' observance of the output cut from the start of November has been positive," he said. Nozari said in remarks published on Saturday that what he called the "real price" for oil was more than $100 a barrel. Other Iranian officials have echoed Saudi Arabia's comments of $75 as a fair price. (Reporting by Hashem Kalantari; Writing by  Fredrik Dahl ; Editing by Sue Thomas)
