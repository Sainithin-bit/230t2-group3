 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Maurice "Hank" Greenberg, former American International Group ( AIG.N ) boss, has questioned whether a Federal Reserve Bank of New York fund, charged with taking on some of the troubled insurer's toxic holdings, paid the right price for some packaged debt securities. 

 Greenberg, a top private shareholder of the insurer, wrote a letter to Chief Executive Edward Liddy in which he said he is interested in knowing more about a transaction in which a New York Fed fund bought about $50 billion in complex debt securities from the insurer's counterparties. The fund bought the securities at face value, Greenberg said in the letter, noting these same securities had likely been marked down by the counterparties. He added that AIG had marked the securities down to about 50 percent of face value. "It certainly seems it was very good for the counterparties," he wrote. On Monday, AIG said it had sold $39.3 billion in assets to another New York Fed fund, Maiden Lane II. The New York Fed extended a loan to the fund to enable the purchase of the securities for an initial purchase price of $19.8 billion. Two New York Fed funds -- Maiden Lane II and Maiden Lane III -- were created to hold liabilities from AIG that caused huge losses to the troubled insurer.
