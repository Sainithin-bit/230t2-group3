 HELSINKI  (Reuters) - Global semiconductor revenue is expected to fall 16.3 percent in 2009 to $219.2 billion after a 4.4 percent fall this year, hit by the sweeping economic downturn, research firm Gartner said on Tuesday. 

 In mid-November Gartner had forecast for the market to fall just 2.2 percent next year. "Never before has the semiconductor industry experienced revenue declines in back-to-back years," Gartner said, adding it expects semiconductor sales in the fourth quarter of 2008 to show a sharpest-ever quarter-on-quarter decline of 24.4 percent. Consumer demand for electronics, from computers to digital cameras, is drying up quickly amid the financial crisis and the prospect of a lingering global recession. Chip makers from giants such as Intel Corp ( INTC.O ) and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd ( 005930.KS ) to contract manufacturers such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co ( 2330.TW ) ( TSM.N ) all expect weak sales in the coming quarters. Gartner said it expects the semiconductor industry to bounce back in 2010 and 2011, with worldwide semiconductor revenue reaching $251.2 billion in 2010, a 14.6 percent increase from 2009, and in 2011 revenue rising 9.4 percent from 2010.
