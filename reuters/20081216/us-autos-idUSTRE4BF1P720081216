 DETROIT/PARIS/STOCKHOLM  (Reuters) - The White House on Tuesday said that it would not be rushed into providing a lifeline for the struggling U.S. automakers as a 26 percent drop in European sales plus production cutbacks showed the global car industry continues to decline. 

 In a daily briefing at the White House, spokeswoman Dana Perino said the Bush administration is "moving with all deliberate speed in order to try to do this in an orderly fashion, but we're not going to be rushed into it. By contrast, French president Nicolas Sarkozy warned that the European Union could become an industrial wasteland without government support for manufacturers, adding that European car makers deserve help, especially if the U.S. government gives emergency funding to the Big Three automakers. Sarkozy said aid could take the form of loans for consumers to buy environmentally friendly cars. General Motors Corp and Chrysler LLC, which is owned by Cerberus Capital Management LP , have said they need immediate cash injections to survive. Ford Motor Co is seeking a government line of credit it could use if its financial position deteriorated more than expected in 2009. PRODUCTION CUTS, WARNINGS While the Bush administration carries out a review of the Big Three's financial data, there were fresh signs on Tuesday of the dire situation facing much of the auto industry. Volkswagen AG Spanish car maker Seat and world number two truckmaker Volvo became the latest companies to announce temporary production halts in response to falling sales as the global economic slowdown batters the industry. Also Honda Motor Co moved up its year-end news conference by two days to Wednesday, raising the possibility that Japan's No. 2 automaker could issue its third profit warning this year. Carmakers have also sought help from their suppliers: Toyota Motor Corp plans to ask Nippon Steel Corp and other steelmakers for a 30 percent price cut, the Nikkei business daily reported on Tuesday. Meanwhile, the world's fourth-largest steelmaker POSCO said on Tuesday it may cut output next year if market conditions continue to worsen. Auto suppliers such as parts makers are also showing signs of strain as sales slump. Johnson Controls Inc, one of the world's largest auto parts makers, withdrew its outlook for 2009, citing the rapid decline in global automotive production and an uncertain outlook for the industry. Separately, two U.S. auto suppliers filed for bankruptcy. Key Plastics LLC, a maker of plastic components for cars and trucks, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection as a sharp decline in vehicle demand caused it to default on debt payments. Auto parts maker Special Devices Inc also filed for bankruptcy protection. Meanwhile European new passenger car registrations dropped 25.8 percent year-on-year according to the ACEA industry body on Tuesday, the seventh consecutive monthly drop. ACEA said the last time registrations fell so sharply was in 1999 and in 1993, before EU enlargement, when the data only covered the 15 EU member states plus the European Free Trade Association countries. November's data referred to the 27 EU member states, plus the EFTA countries and excluded Malta and Cyprus, ACEA said. CUT CUT CUT Separately, Seat said it would further cut production at its main plant in Catalonia in the first half of 2009 in response to diving sales. The maker of the Ibiza and Leon said that between February 2 and June 30 it would halt work at its Martorell plant near Barcelona for seven to 29 days on various production lines. General Motors said on Monday it would temporarily shut down assembly lines at three of its Mexican car factories. The decline in November sales was not just in passenger cars -- truck sales also fell, leading Volvo to stop production for 20 to 25 days in the first quarter of 2009. In afternoon trading, the DJ Stoxx Auto Index was up 2.62 percent while GM was up 2.94 percent and Johnson Controls was down 3.55 percent.
