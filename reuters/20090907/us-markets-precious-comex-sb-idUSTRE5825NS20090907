 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. gold futures rose to a six-month high on Thursday, rallying toward $1,000 an ounce as renewed uncertainties about the equities market prompted investors to allocate funds into safe-haven hard assets. 

 GOLD * December gold settled up $19.20, or 2 percent, at $997.70 an ounce on the COMEX division of the New York Mercantile Exchange. * Ranging from $976.10 to $999.50 -- the highest price since February 24. The December contract has gained as much as $50, or 5.5 percent, from Tuesday's session low of $947.50 an ounce. * Combination of investment fund buying, short-covering and technical breakout fueled gold's two-day sharp rally - traders. * Jittery investors are diversifying assets into gold amid shaky equities markets, which fueled gold's rally - Bill O'Neill, managing director of LOGIC Advisors. * The price of gold futures has broken into a higher trading range, and bullion investors will focus on Friday's U.S. August non-farm payrolls data to see if a test of the psychological $1,000-an-ounce barrier is possible - O'Neill. * Gold driven higher by safe-haven buying due to concerns about the U.S. financial sector, and the recent positive correlation between the metal and equities was notably broken this week - analysts. * Shares of gold mining companies, including No. 1 Barrick Gold ( ABX.TO ) and No. 2 Newmont Mining ( NEM.N ), rallied on Thursday as the price of the precious metal rose sharply. [ID:nN0391287] * Inflow related to the closure of energies and other commodities exchange-traded products because of expected new regulations on commodities market prompted investors to step up buying in gold - traders. * COMEX estimated final volume at 147,643 lots. * Crude futures eased to trade below $70 per barrel as Wall Street slipped. Investors view crude oil as a barometer of economic growth. * Gold/oil ratio at 14.6, up from the previous session's 14.22. Gold has outperformed oil this week, a sign that inflation expectations could be on the rise. * Spot gold at $993.80 an ounce at 2:08 p.m. EDT (1808 GMT), against $976.60 in late Wednesday dealings in New York. * London afternoon gold fix was at $983 an ounce. SILVER * December silver hit a one-year high. It ended up 92.50 cents, or 6 percent, at $16.290 an ounce, following gold's rally. * Silver futures have recently outperformed gold, helped by better economic sentiment. Usually less-liquid silver has the characteristics of both precious and industrial metals. * Ranged from $15.360 to $16.310 an ounce -- the highest level since August 2008. * COMEX estimated final volume at 34,030 lots. * Spot silver at $16.16 an ounce, versus its previous close of $15.34. * London silver fix was at $15.73 an ounce. PLATINUM * October platinum finished up $23.70, or 1.9 percent, at $1,253.80 an ounce, as gold's rally drove other precious metals higher. * U.S. auto sales released on Monday showed signs of stability, and better economic sentiment also boosted platinum group metals, which are largely used as industrial metals. * Uncertain supply due to labor actions in top platinum producer South Africa provided underlying support. * Spot platinum at $1,247.50 an ounce against $1,229. PALLADIUM * December palladium closed up $5.10, or 1.8 percent, at $294.05 an ounce, tracking platinum's gains. * Spot palladium at $290.50 an ounce, against its previous finish of $284.50.
