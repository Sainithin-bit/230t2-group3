 (Reuters) - Kraft Foods said it was determined to pursue Britain's Cadbury, the world's second largest confectionery group, which rejected a 10.2 billion pound ($16.7 billion) bid from the U.S. company.. 

 Following are facts about Kraft: * Kraft is the world's second largest food group, after Nestle. * The company's origins date to 1903, when James L. Kraft began a business selling cheese from the back of a wagon in Chicago, Illinois. In 1914 the firm started making its own cheese. * Kraft was acquired by tobacco corporation Philip Morris in 1988 for $12.9 billion. * In 2000 Philip Morris bought biscuit firm Nabisco, the maker of Oreo cookies, for $19.2 billion, and merged it with Kraft. * Kraft Foods Inc was listed on the New York Stock Exchange in 2001, with the spin off completed in 2007. * In 2007 Kraft bought the biscuit business of Danone - which includes well known French brand LU - for $7.2 billion. When the bid was announced, French economy minister Christine Lagarde is reported to have said: "We are not yet ready to put ketchup on our petits LU." * Kraft still sells cheese singles under the Kraft brand in some countries, including Britain, while in North America the Kraft brand adorns packets of macaroni cheese. * Kraft's other major brands include Oscar Mayer hotdogs, instant coffee brand Maxwell House, Philadelphia soft cheese and chocolate brands Milka and Toblerone, acquired when it bought Jacobs Suchard in 1990. * Kraft has 98,000 employees and 168 plants. * In 2008 Kraft had revenues of $42 billion. * On August 4, 2009, Kraft reported an 11 percent rise in quarterly profit, boosted by people eating more meals at home during tough economic times.
