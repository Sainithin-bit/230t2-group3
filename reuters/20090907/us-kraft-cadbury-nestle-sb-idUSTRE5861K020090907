 BROC, Switzerland  (Reuters) - Nestle AG, the world's biggest food group, declined comment on whether it may make a counterbid for Britain's Cadbury Plc but reiterated it planned no big acquisitions in 2009 and 2010. 

 "We do not comment on possible reactions by Nestle," the group's Chief Executive Officer Paul Bulcke said after confectionery group Cadbury rejected a 10.2 billion pound ($16.7 billion) cash-and-shares bid by U.S. food giant Kraft Foods Inc. He also declined to rule out any bid for Cadbury on competition grounds, despite both having big business overlaps, especially in the British chocolate market. "We are always open for opportunities but we have no plans for any major acquisitions in 2009 and 2010," Bulcke told a news conference at the opening of its new chocolate research center in the Swiss town of Broc. Earlier, Kraft made its bid for Cadbury valuing the British group at 745 pence a share, a bid which Cadbury promptly rejected. Analysts have speculated that Nestle might be drawn into a bid for Cadbury, but due to competition issues it might look at a joint offer with U.S. chocolate maker Hershey Co, with the U.S. group looking to take Cadbury's chocolate interests leaving Nestle with Cadbury's Trident chewing gum business. Cadbury shares were up 39.5 percent at 792-1/2p and Nestle shares 1 percent ahead at 43.74 Swiss francs by 5:10 a.m. EDT. (Reporting by  David Jones ; Editing by  David Holmes )
