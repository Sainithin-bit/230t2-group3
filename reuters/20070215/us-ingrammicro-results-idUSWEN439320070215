 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Ingram Micro Inc. ( IM.N ), the world's largest computer products distributor, posted a higher quarterly profit on Thursday, helped by a legal settlement and a lower tax rate. 


 Net income rose 8.8 percent to $91.7 million, or 53 cents per share, from $84.4 million, or 51 cents per share, a year earlier. Net sales were up 11 percent to $8.85 billion from $7.96 billion. Net income included 2 cents per share from a legal settlement and 1 cent per share from a lower tax rate for 2006. Problems involving a new warehouse management system in Germany cost Ingram Micro about 3 cents to 4 cents per share in the quarter compared with its earlier outlook. The warehouse problems have since been resolved, Ingram Micro said. Ingram Micro Chief Executive Gregory Spierkel said in a statement that nearly every country in which the company operates "performed well." Ingram Micro, based in Santa Ana, California, is considered a bellwether for the broader computer industry because it is an intermediary between producers and buyers. Ingram Micro shares were little changed in extended trading following the earnings report after closing up 1.7 percent at $20.30 in regular-session trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock is up 23 percent since hitting a 52-week low of $16.54 in August and has been trading near its year high of $21.10 reached in November. Ingram Micro forecast first quarter net income in a range of $63 million to $70 million, or 36 cents to 40 cents per share. The estimate compares with analysts' average forecast for net income of $66.3 million, according to Reuters Estimates. Ingram Micro expects sales to range from $8.1 billion to $8.35 billion in the first quarter, compared with analysts' average forecast of $8.05 billion.
