 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Procter & Gamble Co. ( PG.N ) said on 
Thursday it was seeking a buyer for its Japanese adult diaper 
business even as the market posts steady growth due to the 
country's greying population. 


  P&G, known for products such as Tide detergent and Pampers 
diapers, said it was looking to unload its Attento diaper brand 
because it did not fit into its strategy of focusing on 
products that it can expand on a global scale.  The company launched Attento nationwide in 1982. The diaper 
is now sold mainly in Japan, with a small amount of sales in 
Hong Kong. P&G does not sell adult diapers anywhere else.  P&G spokeswoman Minako Yoshikawa said the Japanese market 
for paper diapers is worth about 60 billion yen ($500 million) 
and is growing at about 5 to 10 percent a year.  The top three makers of adult diapers in Japan are 
Uni-Charm Corp. ( 8113.T ), unlisted Hakujuji Co. Ltd. and Kao 
Corp. ( 4452.T ). P&G's Attento ranks fourth, Yoshikawa said.  P&G said in a statement it would keep and continue to run 
the business if it could not find a suitable buyer at the right 
price.  Nomura Securities, a unit of Nomura Holdings Inc. ( 8604.T ) 
will handle the deal, it said.
