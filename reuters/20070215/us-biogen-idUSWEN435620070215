 BOSTON  (Reuters) - Biogen Idec Inc. ( BIIB.O ) said on Thursday that fourth-quarter earnings rose on higher sales of its cancer and multiple sclerosis drugs. 


 The Cambridge, Massachusetts-based biotechnology company posted a net profit of $109 million, or 32 cents a share, compared with a profit of $56 million, or 16 cents a share a year ago. Excluding one-time items, Biogen earned 53 cents a share. Analysts had on average expected earnings, excluding one-time items, of 55 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue rose 12 percent to $708 million, driven mainly by sales of the multiple sclerosis drug Avonex, whose sales rose 6 percent to $439 million and cancer drug Rituxan. Sales of Biogen's multiple sclerosis drug Tysabri were $30 million, of which $23 million were generated in the United States and $7 million in Europe. Biogen received $18 million of that revenue, based on its partnership agreement with Elan Corp. ( ELN.I ) ( ELN.N ). The company said it expects total revenue growth in 2007 to be in the mid-teens percentage. Earnings excluding one-time items will be in the range of $2.50 and $2.65 a share, the company said. Biogen expects net earnings in 2007 to be in the range of $1.69 and $1.84 a share, excluding any future transactions or acquisition.
