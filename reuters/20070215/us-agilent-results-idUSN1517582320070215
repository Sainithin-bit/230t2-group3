 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Electronics testing equipment maker Agilent Technologies Inc. ( A.N ) said on Thursday that its first quarter earnings fell from a year earlier, when the company reported a large gain from the sale of its semiconductor products business. 


 Revenues rose 9.7 percent to $1.28 billion, as Agilent said it had particular strength in its bioanalytical measurement business, where revenue rose 22 percent. The revenue growth came despite what Agilent, the No. 1 maker of scientific-testing gear, said was "significant weakness" in its wireless handset business. Revenue in its electronic measurement business grew 4 percent. Excluding the impact of a weak handset test market, revenue growth in that segment was about 9 percent. "We were able to absorb, clearly, a major slowdown in cell phone capitalization and still turn in a solid quarter," Agilent Chief Executive Bill Sullivan said by phone. "Hopefully this is just a pause after the holidays and we'll see increased investment in the second half of the year." Agilent said net income for its first fiscal quarter ended January 31 declined to $150 million, or 36 cents per share, from $2.82 billion, or $5.83 per share, a year ago. Agilent also said adjusted net income from continuing operations was $162 million, or 39 cents a share. Excluding the gains in the year-ago quarter, Agilent had a profit of $154 million, or 32 cents per share. The results were in line with Santa Clara, California-based Agilent's forecast given in November. It said then it expected adjusted earnings per share of 36 cents to 40 cents and revenue of $1.25 billion to $1.29 billion. Sullivan said on a conference call that Agilent's communications test business was down 6 percent from a year ago, reflecting the weakness in the handset test market in Asia. For the current, second quarter, the company said it expects an adjusted per-share profit of 41 cents to 45 cents per share and revenue of $1.30 billion to $1.34 billion. Shares of Agilent rose 1 percent in extended trade after the earnings report, before settling back to $33.80. In regular trading, the stock closed up 89 cents, or 2.7 percent, at $33.83. In the last 12 months, the stock has declined 5.3 percent, based on Wednesday's close.
