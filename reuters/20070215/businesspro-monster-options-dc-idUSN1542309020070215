 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Federal prosecutors are expected to 
announce a plea deal with a former executive of recruitment 
service Monster Worldwide Inc. ( MNST.O ) in a stock options 
manipulation case, the Wall Street Journal reported on 
Thursday, citing people familiar with the matter. 


  The company's former general counsel, Myron Olesnyckyj, has 
agreed to cooperate with federal prosecutors in Manhattan and 
is expected to describe the role of founder Andrew McKelvey and 
others in stock-options practices at Monster, the paper said.  Olesnyckyj was fired by the company last year. McKelvey 
quit after declining to be interviewed again for the options 
probe. Neither could be immediately reached for comment.  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is expected to 
file civil charges against Olesnyckyj as soon as today, the 
paper said citing people familiar with the matter.  Monster admitted in December that it had overstated profit 
from 1997 to 2005 by $271.9 million and that the exercise price 
of a substantial number of stock option grants from 1997 
through March 2003 was different from the fair market value of 
the underlying shares on the grant date.  Monster officials were not immediately available to 
comment.
