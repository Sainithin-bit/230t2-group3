 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Oilfield services company Baker Hughes Inc. ( BHI.N ) said on Thursday that quarterly profit rose as higher sales and a benefit from an accounting change helped offset a one-time charge. 


 Net profit in the 2006 fourth quarter was $326.2 million, or $1.02 per diluted share, compared with $257.9 million, or 75 cents per diluted share, in the same quarter a year earlier. The Houston-based company said the latest quarter included a charge related to the resolution of federal investigations into its activities in Angola, Kazakhstan and Nigeria of $38.5 million after tax, or 12 cents per share. Analysts on average were expecting $1.19 per share, excluding items, according to Reuters Estimates. Quarterly revenue was $2.45 billion, up from $1.99 billion a year ago. For the full year 2007, Baker said it expects non-North American revenue to increase 17 percent to 19 percent. The company also said it expects corporate and other expenses, excluding interest expense and interest and dividend income, of $235 million to $255 million and capital spending of $1.0 billion and $1.2 billion.
