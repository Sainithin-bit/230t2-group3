 ZURICH  (Reuters) - Credit Suisse made the surprise appointment of investment banking head Brady Dougan as new chief executive after posting stronger-than-expected results on Thursday, sending its shares sharply higher. 


 The news that Dougan would take over from Oswald Gruebel, who masterminded the group's recovery and will stand down on May 4, all but eclipsed the glittering results, especially since Gruebel had previously said he had no plans to retire. The appointment of Dougan, who has driven startling growth in the bank's core investment banking business, signals a cultural shift, putting an American in charge of a Swiss banking icon, a pattern set by other Swiss companies. Zurich Financial Services Group also has an American in charge. "Brady is going to be coming in on a high," said a banking analyst in London. "The investment banking results were stunning." Shares in the group were up 3.7 percent at 91.95 francs at 0835 GMT, the biggest gainer on the DJ Stoxx index of European banking shares The bank said on Thursday that fourth-quarter net group profit was 4.673 billion Swiss francs ($3.75 billion), far above analysts' forecasts, as trading revenues jumped 130 percent and commission and fee income rose 25 percent. Gruebel, 63, told financial reporters he was retiring as he considered his work at the bank was done, having completed a dramatic turnaround for the group that started in 2002. "There is no need for me to hang around," he said. "If you can end your career with such a result, it's not the worst way to go," said Andreas Venditti, analyst at Zuericher Kantonal Bank. Dougan, invited by Gruebel to address a news conference detailing the bank's results, said "I believe the continued growth of Credit Suisse as an integrated global bank is one of the greatest value growth propositions in the industry." "We are extremely well positioned for future growth," he said. The results also showed that a belt-tightening drive in the investment banking business, led by Mark Rufeh, a former chief operating officer at Lehman, was paying rich dividends. The investment bank's compensation-to-revenue ratio, a closely watched measure of efficiency, improved to 42.2 percent in the fourth quarter from 53.5 percent in the first three quarters of 2006, a development one analyst called dramatic. "The better-than-expected result is entirely attributable to a much better performance within the investment bank," said analysts at Zurich-based bank Vontobel. The numbers were in marked contrast to Tuesday's results from rival Swiss bank UBS, where rapid growth in staff numbers drove up costs, sending its shares lower. Paul Calello, who heads Credit Suisse's fast-growing Asian operations, takes over from Dougan as head of investment banking, putting another American in a top position. BOOMING INVESTMENT BANK The result included a net capital gain of 1.817 billion francs from the sale of its Winterthur insurance business to France's AXA. Net profit from continuing operations was 2.599 billion francs. A poll of 18 analysts gave an average net profit forecast of 3.235 billion francs. The bank also reported a net inflow of 8.6 billion francs into its wealth management business. Analysts gave an average forecast of 9.7 billion francs. Credit Suisse had said in November it was heading for a record earnings year, but investors conscious of rising costs at UBS have been waiting to see if its efficiency drive would deliver all it has promised. It also earmarked 4 billion francs in January to invest in existing businesses and 3.5 billion francs for acquisitions, mostly in wealth and asset management, as it chases growth in high-performing emerging markets. Credit Suisse said last month it would pay a 2.24 francs dividend for 2006 and a par value reduction of 0.46 francs. Credit Suisse shares trade at 13 times estimated 2007 earnings, below Swiss rival UBS on just under 14, which has a stronger wealth management franchise, but above Deutsche Bank's 10, according to Reuters data.
