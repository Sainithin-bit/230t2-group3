 AMSTERDAM  (Reuters) - NYSE Euronext launched on Thursday an exchange offer for all outstanding shares of pan-European bourse operator Euronext ENXT.PA after the U.S. securities regulators approved its translatlantic merger. 


 The share offer runs from February 15 to March 21 and will be settled on April 4, Euronext said in a statement. Euronext, which operates the Paris, Amsterdam, Brussels and Lisbon bourses and the Euronext.Liffe derivatives, is merging with New York Stock Exchange operator NYSE Group NYX.N to create the first transatlantic bourse. Under the terms of the merger deal with NYSE, the combined group offered 0.98 new NYSE Euronext shares plus 21.32 euros in cash for each Euronext share. The same offer is being made for the outstanding stock. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved the proposed $14 billion merger on Wednesday. The widely-anticipated approval allows both Euronext and the NYSE Group to be wholly-owned subsidiaries of a new publicly-traded holding company, called NYSE Euronext. The London Stock Exchange ( LSE.L ), after the Nasdaq Stock Market Inc.'s ( NDAQ.O ) failed hostile bid, said it is seeking alliances with other bourses, including Tokyo and possibly forging an alliance with the NYSE Euronext.
