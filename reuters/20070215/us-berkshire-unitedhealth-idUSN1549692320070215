 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Warren Buffett's holding company Berkshire Hathaway Inc ( BRKa.N ) bought 1 million shares of insurer UnitedHealth Group ( UNH.N ) in the fourth quarter of 2006, according to a regulatory filing. 


 Berkshire detailed its holdings for the quarter ended December 31, 2006 in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission late on Wednesday. In the third quarter, Berkshire did not own any shares of UnitedHealth, the largest U.S. health insurer by market value. The company has overhauled corporate governance procedures and changed its management structure but still faces a federal investigation into its dating of stock options. UnitedHealth has about 1.4 billion common shares outstanding. The latest quarterly filing also showed Berkshire acquired a big stake in U.S. Bancorp ( USB.N ) and cut its holdings in tax preparer H&R Block Inc. ( HRB.N ). UnitedHealth shares were up $2.18, or 4.2 percent, at $53.82 in late afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange, leading a rally among health insurer stocks.
