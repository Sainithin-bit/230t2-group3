 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Molson Coors Brewing Co. ( TAP.N ) TAPb.TO on Thursday reported that quarterly profit quadrupled, trouncing expectations, on higher pricing and volume growth, sending its shares up as much as 6.6 percent. 


 The brewer of Molson Canadian and Coors Light, beset by higher packaging and energy costs and price cuts in key markets during much of 2006, is now showing the benefits from the 2005 merger of Canadian brewer Molson Inc. and American rival Adolph Coors Co., analysts said. "We consider the (fourth-quarter) result the most persuasive indicator yet that the Molson merger is a value-creator," said Stifel Nicolaus analyst Mark Swartzberg in a research note. Fourth-quarter earnings shot up to $99.2 million, or $1.14 per share, from $22.4 million, or 26 cents per share, a year ago. Excluding special items, income from continuing operations was $108.4 million, or $1.24 per share. On that basis, analysts, on average, expected 94 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. The company said an additional week in its fourth-quarter calendar added about $6 million, or 7 percent, to pretax income and about 6 percent to total sales volume, excluding special items. Molson Coors was also helped by a lower effective tax rate of 24 percent in the quarter, including special items, down from 37 percent a year ago. Total net sales rose 10.6 percent to $1.53 billion, while sales by volume, which measures sales to wholesalers, increased 5.2 percent to 10.9 million barrels. The company realized about $33 million in acquisition and other cost savings from the merger, and officials hope to see another $55 million in merger-related savings in 2007. "We finished 2006 with even stronger brands, positive pricing, cost savings that exceeded our goals for the year, double-digit earnings growth and strong cash generation," said Leo Kiely, the chief executive. Kiely told investors on a conference call the company would focus on more cost savings for 2007 and invest heavily in marketing and advertising. The benefits of cost cutting might be offset by higher aluminum, energy and other input costs, he said. Canadian sales volume increased 6.7 percent, and sales to retailers were up 1.1 percent, bolstered by double-digit growth in Coors Light and partner import brands that offset a decline in other premium and discounted brands. Pretax income in Canada rose 30.2 percent, Molson said, due to the extra selling week, positive pricing and lower overhead. In the United States, sales volume rose 7.1 percent and sales to retailers were up 2.1 percent, driven by growth in Coors Light, Keystone Light and Blue Moon. Including the extra selling week, Molson's Europe owned-brand sales volume increased 0.7 percent but excluding the week fell 4.2 percent, hurt by lower beer pricing and an unfavorable product mix. Molson Coors shares rose $4.15 to $86.62 on the New York Stock Exchange, after reaching as high as $87.88 earlier in the session. Molson shares trade at 18.1 times earnings estimates for the current year. Rival Anheuser-Busch Cos Inc. ( BUD.N ) has a price-to-earnings ratio of 18.3.
