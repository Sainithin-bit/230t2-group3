 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Caterpillar Inc. ( CAT.N ) said on Thursday it planned to take control of a construction machinery venture with Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. ( 7011.T ) as part of its efforts to beef up its presence in Asia. 


 Caterpillar, the world's largest construction machinery maker, is keen on expanding in fast-growing Asian markets such as China as it sees a downbeat demand outlook for diesel engines and heavy equipment as the U.S. economy slows. Mitsubishi Heavy, Japan's largest machinery maker, said Caterpillar is in talks with Mitsubishi to raise the U.S. company's stake in their 50-50 construction machinery joint venture to about two-thirds. Mitsubishi Heavy spokesman Hideo Ikuno said the sale of part of its stake in the joint venture, Shin Caterpillar Mitsubishi Ltd., was in line with a strategy of shifting resources to core businesses such as power systems, aerospace and turbo chargers. Construction machinery is no longer considered a core operation. Late last year, Caterpillar said it expected sales in China to quadruple as a percentage of its global sales by 2010 as the country rapidly builds more ports, energy projects and roads, and moved its Asia Pacific Operations headquarters to Beijing from Tokyo. Caterpillar Asia Pacific Operations spokesman Jim Dugan said Japan represents a mature market for his company where it makes high-quality products, and China is a market with a large growth potential. "It (the announcement) is really a sign of our recognition of the importance of the Japanese market to Caterpillar and our commitment to that market and our customers in Japan," he said. Goldman Sachs analyst Kunio Sakaida wrote in a note to clients that he sees the news as positive for Mitsubishi's stock price as it would enable the company to concentrate its resources on diesel engines and turbo chargers, the outlook for which is good. The venture, established in 1963, produces and sells hydraulic excavators, wheel loaders and bulldozers. It booked sales of 386 billion yen ($3.2 billion) in the business year ended March 2006. As a group, Mitsubishi Heavy had sales of 2.8 trillion yen. Mitsubishi Heavy's Ikuno said the talks would likely see Mitsubishi Heavy's stake in the venture fall to about one-third. The venture has capital of 23.1 billion yen. Elsewhere, Komatsu Ltd. ( 6301.T ), the world's second-biggest maker of construction machinery, said last month it will sell its outdoor power equipment unit Komatsu Zenoah Co. to Swedish garden equipment and tools group Husqvarna ( HUSQb.ST ) for 18.3 billion yen ($150.4 million). Komatsu spokesman Masahiko Kitaoka said the company decided to sell the unit as Komatsu moves to focus on larger-sized construction equipment such as hydraulic excavators and dump trucks as part of a reshuffle of its businesses. Shares of Mitsubishi Heavy closed down 1.4 percent at 684 yen after the announcement, underperforming a 0.81 percent rise in the benchmark Nikkei average  .N225 .
