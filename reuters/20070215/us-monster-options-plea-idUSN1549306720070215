 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A former general counsel at Monster Worldwide Inc. ( MNST.O ) pleaded guilty on Thursday to criminal charges related to stock options backdating. 


 Myron Olesnyckyj pleaded guilty to conspiracy and securities fraud in the U,S. Court for the Southern District of New York before District Judge Laura Taylor Swain. The parent company of the leading jobs Web site said in November it had fired Olesnyckyj in connection with its internal stock options investigation. Monster said in December that it had overstated profit from 1997 to 2005 by $271.9 million and found errors with its option grants awards.
