 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Avon Products Inc. ( AVP.N ) on Thursday said restructuring savings should be more than double its prior expectations due to new plans it is putting into place, but said it would take a year longer than planned for its operating margin to recover. 


 Avon, the world's largest direct seller of cosmetics, said its restructuring savings should now exceed $700 million, rather than $300 million, due to additional benefits from its plan to sell fewer, more profitable products and a move toward global purchasing. Morgan Stanley analyst Bill Pecoriello said the savings from the two additional programs was exactly in-line with his expectations. While operating margin should expand from 2006's level of 8.7 percent this year, it won't come close to 2005's level of 14.1 percent until 2008. Avon said once it reaps more savings and benefits from its plans, operating margin should expand further, starting in 2009. "We expect the market will react negatively to Avon pushing out the margin recovery assumptions, but we think Avon is doing the right thing: Setting expectations low and heavily reinvesting," Bear Stearns analyst Justin Hott said in a note to clients. Over the long term, revenue growth should average mid-single digits, the company said. Shares of Avon rose less than 1 percent in morning trade. ADVERTISING SPENDING Avon said that it would increase advertising spending by 35 percent in 2007 to about $340 million, after raising spending by 83 percent in 2006. The increased spending helped to renew interest in its products after a flurry of skin care competition hit the market in 2005 from rivals such as Procter & Gamble Co. ( PG.N ). The company introduced a new advertising campaign, with the slogan "Hello Tomorrow," during a meeting with analysts and investors in New York. Commercials for the new global campaign, set to debut in March, highlight Avon's products, such as lipstick and the Anew skin care line, and feature women talking about how they enjoy being Avon representatives. New York-based Avon unveiled is restructuring in November 2005. Since then, it has cut hundreds of jobs and weeded out less profitable products. Avon said that it expects to benefit from its global purchasing plan beginning in the second half of 2007, and from product revamping over the next three years. The company still expects its original restructuring plan to cost $500 million. It spent $285 million on that program through the end of 2006. Shares were up 33 cents to $39.04 in late morning trading after falling as low as $38. The shares hit a high of $39.72 earlier this month, their highest level since June 2005.
