 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Car dealership group Lithia Motors Inc. ( LAD.N ) posted a 47 percent decline in fourth- quarter earnings on Thursday, as higher expenses more than offset a gain in new vehicle sales. 


 Net income was $5.53 million, or 27 cents per share, compared with $10.49 million, or 50 cents per share, a year earlier. Revenue was up 12 percent to $735.82 million from $655.3 million driven by gains in new cars sales and financing and insurance, as well as higher service fees for repairs. Lithia kept its 2007 earnings outlook unchanged at between $1.90 to $2.10 per share, citing higher health care and benefit costs and a continued drag from the lagging performance of Detroit-based automakers. Lithia shares rose about 1 percent in after-hours trading to $29.89 from $29.53 at the New York Stock Exchange close. Medford, Oregon-based Lithia, which has 104 auto dealerships in 15 states, is a major Chrysler Group retail outlet. The company's strategy of targeting rural dealerships and lower-cost franchises for U.S. auto brands has left it more reliant on sales of trucks and sport-utility vehicles, which have sputtered in recent months. Lithia said in a statement that more stable fuel prices helped truck and SUV sales in the fourth quarter compared with the third quarter. Overall new vehicle sales rose 17.5 percent in the fourth quarter to 14,770 units, it said. Fourth quarter earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding the costs of equity-based compensation, was 36 cents per share compared with 50 cents per share on the same basis a year earlier. Including a 3 cent per share charge for stock-based compensation and a 1 cent per share charge related to accounting for financial derivatives, Lithia's profit from continuing operations was 32 cents per share. Wall Street analysts, on average, had been expecting adjusted earnings of 34 cents per share, with a range of between 30 cents and 36 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates.
