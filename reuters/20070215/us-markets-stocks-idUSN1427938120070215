 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Stocks rose for a third day and the Dow Jones industrial average closed at a record on Thursday, helped by a share-buyback plan from Caterpillar Inc. and a sizable aircraft order for Boeing Co. 


 Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, in his second day of congressional testimony, told lawmakers that economic growth could be stronger than perceived, which gave investors reason to be cautious because the Fed would be less likely to lower interest rates. The market rallied on Wednesday after Bernanke said inflation is poised to ease while the economy grows moderately. "The thinking lately has been, 'When is the correction coming?' and when everybody's looking for a correction, it doesn't usually come. There's a lot of liquidity in the market, a nirvana environment in terms of the Fed and a lot of merger activity occurring," said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer of Solaris Asset Management in Bedford Hills, New York. He added that "there was a lot of company-specific news driving the indexes today." The Dow Jones industrial average was up 23.15 points, or 0.18 percent, at 12,765.01, a record close. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index was up 1.51 points, or 0.10 percent, at 1,456.81 -- a six-year high. The Nasdaq Composite Index was up 8.72 points, or 0.35 percent, at 2,497.10. The Dow also rose to an intraday record of 12,779.03. Caterpillar, a maker of heavy construction and mining equipment, announced plans for a $7.5 billion share buyback over the next five years, citing its confidence in long-term growth prospects and cash-flow generation. Its stock rose 2.2 percent, or $1.46, to $67.62 on the New York Stock Exchange. Helping the S&P 500 index were shares of insurer UnitedHealth Group, up 3.8 percent, or $1.97, at $53.61, after a regulatory filing showed Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. bought 1 million shares of the company. The stock of U.S. aircraft maker Boeing Co. gained 2 percent, or $1.77, to $91.71 after it confirmed an order for 27 of its 767-300 freighters from package delivery company United Parcel Service Inc. Shares of Qualcomm Inc. gave the biggest boost to the Nasdaq after Oppenheimer & Co. said it is raising its rating of wireless chip supplier, citing the potential for higher-than-anticipated earnings this year and next year. Qualcomm shares rose 4.2 percent, or $1.65, to $41.31. Also on the Nasdaq, shares of Network Appliance Inc., a maker of network storage equipment, rose 4.9 percent, or $1.89, to $40.30 after it gave a revenue forecast that was above average Wall Street expectations. Still, investors struggled to reconcile a mixed batch of economic data released on Thursday. U.S. industrial output fell in January while the number of Americans filing for jobless benefits jumped sharply last week, according to reports. A survey of Mid-Atlantic manufacturers suggested things were not getting any better in February, showing activity in the region was essentially at a standstill. The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia's survey of U.S. mid-Atlantic manufacturing showed business activity barely rose in February -- a reading that was well below economists' expectations. Trading was light to moderate on the NYSE, with about 1.38 billion shares changing hands, well below last year's estimated daily average of 1.84 billion, while on Nasdaq, about 1.99 billion shares traded, below last year's daily average of 2.02 billion. Advancing stocks outnumbered declining ones by a ratio of about 3 to 1 on the NYSE, while advancers just slightly outpaced decliners on the Nasdaq.
