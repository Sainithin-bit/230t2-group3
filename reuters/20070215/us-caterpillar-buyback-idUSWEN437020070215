 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Caterpillar Inc., ( CAT.N ) a maker of heavy construction and mining equipment, said on Thursday it plans a new $7.5 billion share buyback over the next five years, citing its confidence in long-term growth prospects and cash-flow generation. 


 The Peoria, Illinois-based company said its board of directors authorized the repurchase program, which will start when the current $6.4 billion buyback program is completed in the next few months, a year and a half ahead of schedule. "We view the new share buyback program as a positive for the stock as it provides the company with higher flexibility to meet its earnings outlook," Merrill Lynch analyst Andrew Obin said in a research note. But Obin said he was not raising earnings-per-share estimates of $5.60 in 2007 and $6.05 in 2008, because the estimates already modeled in a buyback. Caterpillar said its priorities for the use of cash remain capital expenditures, acquisitions, funding pension programs and raising dividends, with the rest devoted to buybacks. Separately, the company is in talks to raise its stake in a construction machinery venture with Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. ( 7011.T ), to beef up Caterpillar's presence in Asia. Mitsubishi said Caterpillar is looking to raise its stake in the 50-50 joint venture to about two-thirds. In addition, stock commentator Jim Cramer recommended the stock on his CNBC television program, "Mad Money," saying on Wednesday the stock is worth owning because of Caterpillar's exposure to faster-growing international markets. Caterpillar stock rose $1.18, or 1.8 percent, to $67.34 on the New York Stock Exchange. Counting Thursday's advance, Caterpillar shares, part of the Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI , are down about 6 percent over the past year, lagging the blue chip average. They are down about 17 percent from their 52-week high in May 2006.
