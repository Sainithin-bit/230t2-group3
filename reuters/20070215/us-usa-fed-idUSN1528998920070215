 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve would raise interest rates if inflation moved higher, Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke said on Thursday, warning that the economy might be stronger than it appears. 


 Testifying to Congress for a second day on the central bank's semi-annual economic report, Bernanke reminded financial markets that the central bank was maintaining an anti-inflation vigil even though economic growth appears to be slowing. Financial markets rallied on Wednesday on the view, inspired by Bernanke's first day of testimony, that inflation was moderating and the economy expanding. "We've seen some very strong consumer spending numbers and we've seen some strong income growth, which suggests that the economy may be stronger than we think," the Fed chief told the House of Representatives' Financial Services Committee. "In order for this expansion to continue in a sustainable way, inflation needs to be controlled," he told panel chairman Barney Frank, a Massachusetts Democrat, who asked why the Fed was more worried about inflation than growth. "If inflation becomes higher for some reason, then the Federal Reserve would have to respond to that by raising interest rates," Bernanke stated flatly. The hawkish opening to Bernanke's question-and-answer session before the House panel briefly drove prices for U.S. government bonds lower and gave a lift to the U.S. dollar as traders revisited bets made on Wednesday that the Fed would likely lower borrowing costs by late in the year. However, a batch of weak economic data trumped Bernanke's comments and futures markets reflected an even greater expectation of a rate cut in the third quarter than they had on Wednesday. Later, St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank President William Poole told reporters after addressing financial analysts in Omaha, Nebraska, that he considered official interest rates were well-positioned currently. "Where we stand right now is a pretty good place," Poole said. "There is no compelling information presently available that suggests the need to reposition the rate.' "But it may come," he added. "The fed funds rate is not going to be 5.25 percent for ever." Bernanke's opening statement was identical to the one he delivered on Wednesday to the Senate Banking Committee and he repeated that core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy costs, remains "somewhat elevated." Some House lawmakers, including Frank, expressed frustration that the generally positive economic outlook that Bernanke described was not fully shared by ordinary Americans who feel their incomes pinched. "I'm a little puzzled when ... you say production is below potential, rising to potential, but then you say you think it might be more than you think," Frank said. "It does seem to me a little odd for you to say, 'Here's what I think, but I also think it might be worse than I think.'" GLOBALIZATION UNEASE In opening remarks, Frank said the Bush administration's view that globalization offered only benefits, and that businesses should feel no constraint about moving to wherever costs were lowest, was causing U.S. workers widespread unease. "Increasingly, the average citizen in America and in other countries has come to doubt that growth that results from this policy of entirely free capital to move wherever it finds its best return ... is in their interest," Frank said. Bernanke said jobs were begging for American workers who had the appropriate training and skills, and repeated observations he made in a timely speech a week earlier in which he urged spreading economic opportunity by making education more readily available. His testimony this week comes in a highly charged atmosphere on Capitol Hill where ruling Democrats already are taking positions ahead of 2008 presidential elections on whether opportunity has grown or shrunk since President George W. Bush took office in 2001. Other committee members, including ranking Republican Spencer Bachus of Alabama, joined the fray, saying the economy was healthier now than during the Clinton administration years when the longest U.S. economic expansion on record occurred. "I see a structurally sound economy performing as well as it did in the 1990s in what we now know was an artificial economic bubble," Bachus said.
