 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The ex-general counsel at Monster Worldwide Inc. ( MNST.O ) pleaded guilty on Thursday to criminal charges related to stock options backdating, becoming the latest former U.S. executive ensnared in an options-related case. 


 Myron Olesnyckyj -- who left the company, parent of the leading Internet jobs listing service, in November following its internal probe into stock options award practices -- pleaded guilty to conspiracy and securities fraud in Manhattan federal court. Federal prosecutors previously had brought charges against former executives at Brocade Communications ( BRCD.O ) and Comverse Technology Inc. CMVT.PK stemming from the stock options backdating scandal. On Wednesday, the former chief executive of video game publisher Take-Two Interactive Software Inc. ( TTWO.O ) pleaded guilty in New York state court to options-related charges. Olesnyckyj, 45, of New Providence, New Jersey, faces up to 25 years in prison and fines up to $5.25 million under the charges. A sentencing date was not immediately announced. In a hearing before U.S. District Judge Laura Taylor Swain, Olesnyckyj said that he had started at Monster in 1994 and made $381,000 from the backdating schemes that went on until 2006. He agreed to forfeit that money. Separately, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday filed civil fraud charges against Olesnyckyj, an agency official said. The commission is seeking disgorgement of illicit gains, a civil penalty, an injunction, and a bar against Olesnyckyj serving as a public company officer or director. The parent company of Monster.com said in November it had fired Olesnyckyj in connection with its internal stock options investigation. In a statement on Thursday, Monster said: "The company terminated this individual some time ago and it is inappropriate to comment on the developments. The company will continue to cooperate with the government in this ongoing investigation." Monster said in December that it had overstated profit from 1997 to 2005 by $271.9 million, and that the exercise price of a significant number of stock option grants from 1997 through March 2003 was different from the fair market value of the underlying shares on the grant date. In October 2006, Andrew McKelvey resigned from his positions as chairman and CEO of the company. The Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday that Olesnyckyj has agreed to cooperate with federal prosecutors and is expected to describe the role of McKelvey and others in the options scandal at Monster. Monster executives told Reuters recently that current senior managers were not under investigation but said they could not speak about whether other current employees were part of the probe.
