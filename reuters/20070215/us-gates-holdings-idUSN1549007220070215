 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp. ( MSFT.O ) Chairman Bill Gates has shed most of his investments in home builders, as revealed in a quarterly filing of the holdings of his charitable foundation. 


 The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Trust showed a strong interest in the industry, according to a filing in November. It took stakes in at least seven home builders, only to quickly divest in those companies, according to a filing on Wednesday that disclosed the foundation's holdings as of December 31. The overall value of the holdings dropped about 4 percent to $5.9 billion. KB Home ( KBH.N ), Centex Corp. ( CTX.N ), Pulte Homes Inc. ( PHM.N ), Lennar Corp. ( LEN.N ), Beazer Homes USA Inc. ( BZH.N ), Ryland Group Inc. ( RYL.N ), and WCI Communities Inc. WCI.N were dropped from the list of holdings. A slew of U.S. home builders reported weak quarterly results last month, saying they did not see an inkling of a rebound in the U.S. housing market. Gates, through his foundation, also stepped back from the energy industry, unloading his stakes in AES Corp. ( AES.N ), Chevron Corp. ( CVX.N ), Consolidated Edison Inc. ( ED.N ), Dominion Resources Inc. ( D.N ), Duke Energy Corp. ( DUK.N ) and FPL Group Inc. FPL.N. The foundation also removed Ameren Corp. ( AEE.N ), Brookfield Asset Management Inc. ( BAMa.TO ), Scholastic Corp. ( SCHL.O ) and Univision Communications Inc. UVN.N from its portfolio's disclosed listings. The Gates Foundation took on an interest in Respironics Inc. RESP.O, reporting a new stake of 500,000 shares in the maker of ventilators and respiratory drug-delivery systems. It also added shares in Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ( WMT.N ), increasing its stake about 50 percent to 1 million shares from 670,000 shares. The foundation increased its holdings in Caterpillar Inc. ( CAT.N ) to 1.32 million shares from 335,000 shares. It upped its holdings in DaimlerChrysler DCX.N DCXGn.DE to 1 million shares from 666,000 shares. It reduced its shares in Great Plains Energy Inc. ( GXP.N ) to 775,084 shares from 1.8 million shares, and in IAC/InterActiveCorp. ( IACI.O ) to 50,000 shares from 670,000 shares.
