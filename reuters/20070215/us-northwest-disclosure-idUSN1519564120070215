 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Northwest Airlines NWACQ.PK entered the home stretch in its quest to exit bankruptcy, detailing a reorganization plan valuing the company at near $7 billion and saying holders of general unsecured claims would get stock valued at up to 83 percent of allowed claims. 


 The No. 5 U.S. carrier said on Thursday in its so-called disclosure statement that it was on track to exit bankruptcy in the second quarter as a company with an equity value of about $7 billion. The plan requires approval by its creditors and the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York. The filing of its reorganization details marks the start of Northwest's emergence from bankruptcy after slashing costs by $2.4 billion and debt by $4.2 billion. It also represents another sign of healing for an industry that has been punished by competition, global terror concerns and high fuel prices. "We are confident that our plan treats our creditors fairly, and we look forward to working with them to obtain their support for our reorganization plan so that they can receive their recovery as quickly as possible and Northwest can move forward on a sound economic footing," Northwest Chief Executive Doug Steenland said in a statement. The carrier, which has been in bankruptcy alongside Delta Air Lines DALRQ.PK since September 2005, expects a court hearing on its disclosure statement on March 26. Delta, the No. 3 U.S. carrier, also intends to exit bankruptcy in the first half of 2007. According to Northwest's proposed terms, the amount of the allowed general unsecured claims against Northwest is estimated to be between $8.75 billion and $9.5 billion. Holders of general unsecured claims would receive stock valued at 66 percent to 83 percent of those claims. The plan also calls for Northwest to sell $750 million in new common stock. The unsecured creditors will have first opportunity to buy those shares. "I can't speak for the creditors committee, but to me it looks like a fair plan," said Calyon Securities airline analyst Ray Neidl. Employees would receive $1.5 billion in distributions, or about 20 percent economic interest in the airline. Current shares will be canceled, and current shareholders will receive no distribution. Despite that warning, shares of Northwest were up 23 cents at $2.87 in over-the-counter trade. Airlines consultant Robert Mann said the proposed payout to unsecured creditors seemed generous and that there likely would be few complaints from the creditors committee, though it is unclear how much of the employee compensation is reserved for managers. "Its hard to know what the distribution of that is," Mann said. He said, however, that the airline appears on schedule to exit bankruptcy as planned. (Additional reporting by Jonathan Stempel)
