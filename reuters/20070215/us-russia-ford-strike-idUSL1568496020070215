 ST PETERSBURG, Russia  (Reuters) - Production resumed at U.S. carmaker Ford's ( F.N ) plant in Russia on Thursday after a one-day strike over pay and conditions, but workers threatened to down tools again if pay talks stall. 


 "We decided to talk to the management, and we'll restart talks today," union leader Alexei Etmanov told Reuters. The strike marks a rare stirring of industrial unrest in Russia as workers seek a greater share of the profits of eight years of fast economic growth in a rapidly tightening job market. The workers at the St Petersburg plant, one of the biggest in Russia owned by a foreign automaker, returned to work after management made an offer to increase their pay, but they are holding out for more. "If they don't offer anything new, we could restart the strike," Etmanov said. Yekaterina Kulinenko, Ford Russia spokeswoman, said the assembly line began operating at midnight (2100 GMT) and the workers had returned to work. "The daily production norm is 303 Ford Focus models. We will make up for lost production in due course," she said. The strike comes at a time of booming sales for foreign carmakers in Russia. Ford is among the most successful, with total sales of 116,000 locally produced and imported vehicles in Russia last year. It plans to import 2,300 Ford Focus cars to cover the shortage of the model in Russia, where people wait for months for the cheap car. Kulinenko said new talks were scheduled for Thursday. She said that management's latest proposal was a wage hike of 14 to 20 percent, payments for those who have worked for more than five years, an increase to 7,400 roubles ($280) in the bonus for having a baby, interest-free credits and other privileges. "We did not make any new proposals," she said. Assembly line workers typically earn 13,000 to 19,000 roubles ($490-$720) per month, which is above the national average wage in Russia. Annual inflation was 9 percent last year. The plant produced 60,000 cars last year -- mainly the Focus model -- and had planned to increase output this year to 75,000 cars.
