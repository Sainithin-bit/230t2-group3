 PARIS  (Reuters) - Franco-Dutch airline Air France-KLM ( AIRF.PA ) said it plans to order 50 long-haul jetliners from Airbus ( EAD.PA ) and Boeing ( BA.N ) in a deal worth around $12 billion at list prices as it renews its fleet with more fuel-efficient aircraft. 

 The deal for 25 Airbus A350-900s and 25 Boeing 787-9 Dreamliners, which has not yet been finalised with the aircraft manufacturers, also includes options for 60 additional aircraft, the carrier said in a statement on Friday. Rolls-Royce ( RR.L ) provides Trent XWB engines for the Airbus A350s. The carrier will choose engines for the Boeing planes later, it said. "The acquisitions are scaled to a size that can be financed through cash flow generated from Group operations," Air France-KLM said after its board of directors approved the order at a meeting on Thursday. "Following this approval, memoranda of understanding will be signed with Airbus, Boeing and Rolls Royce and the finalized contracts are expected before the end of the year."
