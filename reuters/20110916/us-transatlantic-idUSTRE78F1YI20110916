 (Reuters) - Allied World Assurance Co Holdings and Transatlantic call off their merger in the face of overwhelming shareholder opposition. Transatlantic says both National Indemnity and Validus offers are inadequate, but is open to negotiations.

Aug 8 - Transatlantic spurns bid by Buffett's National Indemnity Co, saying it does not constitute a superior proposal. Aug 11 - Validus sues Transatlantic, but offers to open its own books for review. Aug 12 - Transatlantic opens talks with National Indemnity.

Sept 11 - Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) recommends Transatlantic investors vote against the Allied World deal. Sept 12 - Allied World says ISS recommended its shareholders vote for a deal to buy Transatlantic, contrary to the earlier news that ISS said Transatlantic should reject the offer. Sept 13 - Barclays Capital cites an Allied World executive as saying the company doubts if its bid for Transatlantic will succeed, after a proxy advisory firm said Transatlantic investors should reject the deal.
