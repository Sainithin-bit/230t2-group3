 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp said on Sunday it will open a new advanced safety research facility at its technical center in the U.S. state of Michigan, spending $50 million over the next five years. 

 Toyota, the world's biggest automaker, said the center will work with leading North American universities, hospitals, research institutions, federal agencies, and others to reduce fatalities and injuries on the road. Toyota was the only major brand to post a drop in U.S. sales in 2010 as its safety image suffered from a recall of roughly 10 million vehicles in its biggest market since late 2009.
