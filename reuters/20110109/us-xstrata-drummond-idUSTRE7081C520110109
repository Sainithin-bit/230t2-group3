 LONDON  (Reuters) - London-listed miner Xstrata XTA.L is close to winning the $8 billion auction for Colombia's second-biggest coal miner, British newspaper The Sunday Times said, without citing sources. 

 The newspaper said Xstrata was the only suitor to table a fully-financed offer for the business, which is being sold by family-owned U.S. group Drummond DRMND.UL, by last month's deadline. Bank of America-Merrill Lynch, which is running the auction, extended the timeframe to allow other bidders including London-listed Vedanta Resources ( VED.L ) and India's Essar Global more time to arrange financing, the paper said. However, they have struggled to do so, putting Xstrata in pole position to secure a deal, it added. Xstrata declined to comment. Brazil's Vale ( VALE5.SA ), Glencore International GLEN.UL and mining investment vehicle Vallar VAAR.L also previously showed interest in Drummond's Colombian operations, sources familiar with the matter have said.
