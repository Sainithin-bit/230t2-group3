 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. antitrust authorities said on 
Tuesday they have approved Freeport McMoRan Copper & Gold 
Inc.'s ( FCX.N ) bid to buy Phelps Dodge Corp. PD.N. 

  Officials have completed their investigation of the 
proposed deal without taking any action, the Federal Trade 
Commission said in a notice.  Freeport-McMoRan said in November it had agreed to buy much 
larger Phelps Dodge for about $26 billion in cash and stock to 
create the world's largest publicly traded copper company.  Hedge fund SAC Capital said in a regulatory filing on 
December 11 that it owned more than 5 percent of Phelps Dodge 
and wanted to block the deal because the price was too low.
