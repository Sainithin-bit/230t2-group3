 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Iceland's FL Group hf FL.IC said on Tuesday it bought a 5.98 percent stake in AMR Corp. AMR.N, making it the third-largest shareholder in the parent of American Airlines. 

 Investment company FL Group, which owns 23 percent of Finnish flag carrier Finnair and has made a string of investments in the airline industry, said it had been building the stake in AMR, the world's largest carrier in terms of passenger traffic, over a considerable period of time and had spent over $400 million. "We believe AMR Corp. is well positioned to take advantage of the growing U.S. air travel market," FL Group Chief Executive Hannes Smarason said in an e-mailed statement. "The supply-demand balance has improved considerably over the last several years." AMR wasn't immediately available for comment. The U.S. airline industry is in the midst of a recovery after years of losses stemming from weak demand following the September 11, 2001, attacks. Resurgent demand and removing planes from service have helped carriers increase ticket prices and post profits in recent quarters. FL Group, which controls Danish low-cost carrier Sterling Airlines and was formerly the sole owner of Icelandair, views its stake in AMR as a "financial investment," Smarason told Reuters in a telephone interview. He said the decision to invest in AMR wasn't based on the assumption that mergers will reduce the number of carriers in the U.S. airline industry, but he considers consolidation as "inevitable." In November, US Airways Group Inc. ( LCC.N ) made an unsolicited bid for bankrupt Delta Air Lines Inc. DALRQ.PK. The offer, which is opposed by Delta management, is expected to spur counter-bids or new combinations in the fragmented and highly competitive industry. Other top shareholders in AMR include Tontine Associates, which holds 7.85 percent, and PRIMECAP Management, which owns 7.72 percent, according to Reuters data. Shares in AMR, which were down earlier in the session on lackluster outlook, rose 60 cents, or 2 percent, at $30.85 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
