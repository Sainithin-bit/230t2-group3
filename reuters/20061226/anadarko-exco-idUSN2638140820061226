 NEW YORK  Dec 26 (Reuters) - Anadarko Petroleum Corp.
( APC.N ) said on Tuesday it agreed to sell two gas fields in
Louisiana to EXCO Resources Inc. ( XCO.N ) for $1.6 billion in
cash.  EXCO shares shot up over 6 percent in afternoon trade,
while Anadarko was up 1 percent.  Independent oil and gas producer Anadarko is selling off
assets to cut debt after spending $22.5 billion to buy peers
Kerr-McGee Corp. and Western Gas Resources earlier this year.  It has set a goal of trimming its debt to $12 billion by
the end of 2007 from $26 billion at the end of the third
quarter of this year.  The company said it agreed to sell its Vernon and Ansley
fields, located in Jackson Parish, Louisiana, to EXCO, which is
focused on acquiring and developing onshore North American oil
and natural gas properties.  Sanford Bernstein analyst Ben Dell said that EXCO paid a
reasonable price for the fields, but that the amount paled in
comparison to the "hideously high price" Anadarko paid for
Western Gas and Kerr-McGee.  "Whenever you look at a sale from Anadarko it's never a
question of what the price is. It's a question of what the
price was relative to what they bought in the first place,"
said Dell, who has an "underperform" rating on Anadarko.  "In today's market -- with a $6.50 gas price -- you are not
going to sell assets for that kind of price," Dell said.  The fields produced 192 million cubic feet equivalent per
day from about 350 wells on 66,000 net acres as of Nov. 1,
according to Anadarko.  Six drilling rigs and four work-over rigs are active in the
fields.  EXCO said proved reserves at the fields are estimated to be
about 466 billion cubic feet equivalent per day. The
acquisition would increase EXCO's reserves by more than a
third.  Dallas-based EXCO, which went public in February, said the
purchase will be financed with a new revolving credit facility
and a bridge loan.  Billionaire oil investor T. Boone Pickens is an EXCO board
member and one of its largest shareholders.  Anadarko expects to sell its Venezuela assets, production
sites in Qatar, some onshore U.S. properties, and part of its
K2 Gulf of Mexico development. It has already sold Canadian and
Gulf of Mexico assets for more than $6 billion.  EXCO expects the sale to close in March 2007.  EXCO shares jumped $1.04 to $17.88, and were among the top
percentage gainers on the New York Stock Exchange. Anadarko
rose 47 cents to $42.61 on the NYSE, where it was among the
most active issues.
