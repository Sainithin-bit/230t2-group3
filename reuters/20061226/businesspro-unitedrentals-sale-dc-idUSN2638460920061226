 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - United Rentals Inc. ( URI.N ), the 
world's largest equipment rental company, said on Tuesday it 
will sell its traffic control unit to an entity created by 
private equity investors Wynnchurch Capital Partners and Oak 
Hill Special Opportunities Fund LP for $85 million. 

  Chief Executive Wayland Hicks said the all-cash sale to HTS 
Acquisition Inc. will help Greenwich, Connecticut-based United 
Rentals focus on general rentals, its main business, as well as 
its trench safety, pump and power businesses.  The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter 
of 2007, subject to adjustments. The traffic control unit rents 
such things as barricades, cherry pickers, light towers, signs 
and traffic cones, according to United Rentals' Web site.  United Rentals expects a loss of 19 cents to 24 cents per 
share related to the sale in the fourth quarter. It also said 
the sale should not materially affect 2007 results.  Analysts polled by Reuters Estimates, on average, looked 
for fourth-quarter profit of 65 cents per share.  In 2005, revenue from traffic controls at United Rentals 
totaled $270 million, or 8 percent of overall revenue, while 
revenue from general rentals totaled $3.11 billion, or 87 
percent. The company operates more than 760 locations in 48 
U.S. states, Canada and Mexico.  United Rentals said Wynnchurch invests more than $500 
million, while the Oak Hill fund, a joint venture between Oak 
Hill Advisors LP and Oak Hill Capital Partners, has $500 
million of committed capital.  In morning trading, United Rentals shares fell 1 cent to 
$25.34 on the New York Stock Exchange. They began the year at 
$23.39.
