 DETROIT  (Reuters) - The chief executive of Ford Motor Co. 
( F.N ) met with the chairman of Toyota Motor Corp.( 7203.T ) as 
the first step in potential partnership negotiations, the 
Japanese business daily Nihon Keizai Shimbun said on Tuesday. 

  The newspaper reported in its online edition that Ford CEO 
Alan Mulally and Toyota's Chairman Fujio Cho met last week. The 
meeting was also attended by Ford Executive Vice President Mark 
Fields, who is in charge of restructuring the automaker's 
loss-making North American operations, the newspaper said.  Nikkei cited unnamed sources familiar with the talks as 
saying that Ford was interested in Toyota's hybrid and 
fuel-cell technologies as well as its work in reducing 
manufacturing and parts procurement costs.  Representatives for Ford and Toyota could not be 
immediately reached for comment.
