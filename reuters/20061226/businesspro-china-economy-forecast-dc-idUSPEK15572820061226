 SHANGHAI/BEIJING  (Reuters) - China's economy is expected to 
maintain robust, relatively inflation-free growth next year, a 
state think-tank and central bank officials said on Tuesday. 

  The economy would probably grow by around 9.5 percent in 
2007 as anticipated rises in domestic consumption offset 
slowing fixed-asset investment and foreign trade, the State 
Information Center said in a report.  The body, which is part of the National Development and 
Reform Commission, the top economic planning agency, said that 
it expected gross domestic product to grow within a range of 
8.5 percent to 10.5 percent next year.  "If the economy maintains a steady but fast growth, GDP 
growth should be at about 9.5 percent," said the report 
published in the Shanghai Securities News.  The economy is on track to record its fourth straight year 
of double-digit growth in 2006, but many economists expect it 
to slow modestly in 2007.  Separately, assistant central bank governor Yi Gang told a 
forum that he expected consumer inflation to remain steady at 
within 3 percent next year, as a good grain harvest this year 
meant pressure on food prices would be limited.  Annual consumer price inflation has remained at below 2 
percent all of this year, but it jumped to 1.9 percent in 
November from 1.4 percent in October largely because of rapid 
growth in food prices.
  PRICE RISES SEEN SHORT-LIVED  Tang Xu, head of the People's Bank of China's research 
department, told the same forum that recent price rises for 
agricultural products were of no large concern and could 
actually be beneficial to farmers.  "It will probably be a short-lived phenomenon. We will keep 
an eye on that. But it's unlikely the central bank will take 
any measures," he said, adding that he expected CPI inflation 
to stay at around 2 percent next year.  Tang's department initially made that forecast for 
inflation in a research report published earlier this month; it 
projected GDP growth of 9.8 percent in 2007.  The State Information Center said in its report on Tuesday 
that it saw annual growth in fixed-asset investment slowing to 
around 20 percent in 2007 due to recent government measures to 
rein in runaway capital spending, which peaked at 31.3 percent 
annual growth in the first half.  The think-tank said that consumer prices would probably 
rise 2 percent next year, as retail sales expanded by about 
12.5 percent.  Imports and exports would slow, but the trade surplus would 
expand to around $180 billion, it said. Export growth would 
fall 10 percentage points to about 15 percent partly on further 
yuan appreciation and lower export tax rebates, it added.  Annual growth in China's broad M2 money supply -- which 
slowed in November to 16.8 percent from 17.1 percent in October 
-- should reach 16 percent next year, it said.  The domestic A-share market, which has almost doubled its 
value in 2006, would gain a further 20-30 percent next year, 
said the report, jointly prepared by the Shanghai Securities 
News.  It added that the yuan might appreciate a further 3 to 4 
percent next year. The yuan has gained 3.7 percent since it was 
revalued by 2.1 percent to 8.11 per dollar on July 21, 2005, 
and freed from a dollar peg to float within managed bands.
