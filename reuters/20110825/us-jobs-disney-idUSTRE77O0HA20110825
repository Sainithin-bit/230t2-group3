 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Steve Jobs, who resigned as chief executive officer of Apple Inc on Wednesday, plans to keep his seat on the board of directors of Walt Disney Co, a source close to Disney said on Wednesday. 

 Jobs joined Disney's board when the media company acquired Pixar, the animation studio he ran, for $7.4 billion. The deal was announced in January 2006. (Reporting by  Peter Lauria ; writing by  Martinne Geller ; editing by Carol Bishopric)
