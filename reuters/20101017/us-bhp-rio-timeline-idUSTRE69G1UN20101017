 SYDNEY  (Reuters) - BHP Billiton ( BHP.AX )( BLT.L ) and Rio Tinto ( RIO.AX )( RIO.L ) have scrapped their proposed $116 billion iron-ore joint venture, caving in to opposition from regulators, steelmakers and major investors 16 months after unveiling the plan. 

 Rio and BHP, the world's second- and third-largest iron ore miners, had touted the deal to put together their iron ore operations in Western Australian as essential as it would reap $10 billion in savings. The joint venture would have surpassed Brazil's Vale ( VALE5.SA ) in size, producing 385 million metric tons of ore initially.

Rio statement acknowledges "communications from regulators that indicate potential obstacles to achieving clearance."
