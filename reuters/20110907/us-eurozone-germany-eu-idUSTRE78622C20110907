 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - The EU Commission said on Wednesday it was satisfied with a ruling by Germany's highest court to give parliament more say in euro zone rescue packages and added that an international mission would return to Athens in mid-September. 

 "It is now time for the German government and the German parliament to take this ruling into account," Commission spokesman Amadeu Altafaj told a regular briefing. On Greece, the Commission said the paused discussions between the debt-choked nation and its EU/IMF/ECB troika of lenders would soon resume. "We're thinking in terms of the troika going back to Athens in mid-September," Altafaj said.
