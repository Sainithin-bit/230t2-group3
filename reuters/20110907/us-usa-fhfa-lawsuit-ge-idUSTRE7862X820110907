 BOSTON  (Reuters) - General Electric Co ( GE.N ) said it would "vigorously contest" a lawsuit by the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which said the conglomerate's former WMC unit made inaccurate statements about the sale of two residential mortgage-backed securities. 

 GE was one of 17 large banks and financial institutions sued on Friday by the FHFA, which oversees Fannie Mae ( FNMA.OB ) and Freddie Mac ( FMCC.OB ), over losses on $200 billion of subprime bonds. Fairfield, Connecticut-based GE said in a statement on Wednesday that the two transactions federal regulators are questioning amounted to $549 million and that $66 million in principal remain on them. GE sold the WMC subprime mortgage lending business in 2007. Other big financial institutions targeted in the suit include JPMorgan Chase & Co ( JPM.N ), Royal Bank of Scotland ( RBS.L ) and Bank of America Corp ( BAC.N ), including its Countrywide and Merrill Lynch arms.
