 LONDON  (Reuters) - European stocks rose while the dollar edged higher against the yen on Friday after a key U.S. jobs report came in better-than-expected, underscoring a recovery in the world's biggest economy. 

 The closely-watched data showed the economy lost a less-than-expected 216,000 non-farm payroll jobs. The unemployment rate rose to 9.7 percent in August from 9.4 percent in the previous month. This compares with a forecast for a rise to 9.5 percent. The FTSEurofirst 300 index  .FTEU3  was up 1.5 percent. MSCI world equity index .MIWD00000PUS was up 0.6 percent. U.S. stock futures were up around 0.7 percent, pointing to a firmer open on Wall Street later. The dollar rose 0.6 percent to 93.21 yen. Euro zone two-year yields briefly hit a fresh six-month low of 1.128 percent, before rising later. (Reporting by  Natsuko Waki ; Editing by  Andy Bruce )
