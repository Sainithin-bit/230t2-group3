 (Reuters) - The World Trade Organization has issued its first ruling on U.S. claims that the European Union paid illegal subsidies to Airbus ( EAD.PA ), harming Boeing ( BA.N ). 

 The ruling will not be publicly released for months but the United States reiterated its grievances against government loans to Airbus and the EU said Friday's ruling was only half the story. Following are comments after the confidential report was delivered to the parties. OLIVIER BROCHET, ANALYST, NATIXIS SECURITIES, PARIS "The arguments are strong on both sides. Under WTO rules Airbus does not think it will have to repay substantial amounts and the Americans will have to take this into account. "In any event, all these discussions highlight one thing: Airbus and Boeing won't be alone (in the large aircraft market) forever. Russia and China will arrive on the market in the next decade. A global approach will need to be found for the way in which new aircraft programs are funded." ALEX HAMILTON, SENIOR MANAGING DIRECTOR, JESUP & LAMONT, NEW YORK "Whatever the ruling happens to be, I'm sure it would be appealed but there could be potential tariffs that come of it. This is something that's been going on for years. Decades. And I don't think this is something that's going to be resolved by this report" RICHARD ABOULAFIA, VP ANALYSIS, TEAL GROUP, WASHINGTON D.C. "The US case was pretty strong, and the European governments are probably preparing for appeals and the counter-complaint. But most of all, behind the scenes they are probably preparing to find ways to aid Airbus by different means. That's usually what happens in these disputes, since it's very difficult for governments to change their minds when it comes to industry support. But if the aid becomes more covert, European politicians might need to find a different way to look good to their voters." (Reporting by  Tim Hepher , Kyle Peterson, Matthias Blamont)
