 STOCKHOLM  (Reuters) - European Union president Sweden called Friday for an extra informal summit meeting on September 17 in Brussels to coordinate the bloc's position ahead of the G20 Summit in Pittsburgh. Swedish Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt said the G20 Summit would discuss the overall economic situation, compensation and bonuses in the financial sector as well as how to bolster supervision and regulation of financial markets. 

 It will also tackle the issue of resources and governance of IMF, job creation, energy efficiency and trade negotiations as well as increased support to low income countries, he said. "All these questions and proposals needs to be discussed among EU heads of state and government before Pittsburgh, so that the EU can have a common and strong position at the G20 Summit and speak with one voice," Reinfeldt said in a statement. Sweden said in July that an extra Council of the leaders of the 27-nation bloc could be held in Brussels in September in the run-up to the G20 meeting in Pittsburgh later that month if member states felt there was a need. "We will probably be very clear that we need some kind of regulation on bonuses," Reinfeldt told reporters. The September 17 meeting would be an informal dinner in Brussels, he added. Reinfeldt said EU leaders would be looking into proposals on financial regulation and he believed they would agree on something close to what French President Nicolas Sarkozy had suggested. Sarkozy has said France will push for stronger commitments to limit bankers' bonuses at the meeting of G20 leaders. On whether the entire EU would support caps on bankers' bonuses, Reinfeldt said British Prime Minister Gordon Brown had signed a letter seeking coordination of views on the subject. "I think there is an understanding this is also important for the UK," he said. The financial industry in Europe has argued that stringent regulation in Europe could push more business to Wall Street. Britain, home to the burgeoning London markets, has been particularly cautious about how best to tackle the issue. (Reporting by  David Brunnstrom  and  Mia Shanley ; editing by  Ralph Boulton )
