 LONDON  (Reuters) - British finance minister Alistair Darling said on Friday he believes the world's leading economies will agree measures on bonus structures at banks during G20 talks this weekend. 

 Asked why Britain did not unilaterally impose curbs on financial sector bonuses, Darling told BBC Radio: "My point is that it is not actually in our interests that we get people going off to offshore jurisdictions where they are not properly regulated which is why I would like international agreement -- why I think we will get international agreement." Talking about reform of banking regulation, he added: "You have to have a robust regulatory regime and that we have to decide at the end of the day what is right and what's appropriate. If people don't like that, yes, they could potentially go elsewhere." He repeated also that he expected economic growth to resume around the turn of the year.
