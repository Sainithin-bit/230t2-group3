 SANTA BARBARA, California  (Reuters) - Eventual rate increases by the U.S. Federal Reserve could be forceful or gradual, depending on how economic circumstances develop, Dallas Fed President Richard Fisher said on Thursday. 

 "You have to walk through a river feeling the stones underneath your feet," Fisher told reporters of the Fed's policy approach after a speech in Santa Barbara, California. Fisher said the U.S. economy was on track for "a good snapback" in the third and fourth quarters following a deep and painful recession but that the growth outlook beyond that was more uncertain. Fisher said was not against completing the Fed's planned $1.25 trillion in purchases of mortgage-backed securities "as long as it continues to have a salutary effect, which I believe it's going to have."
