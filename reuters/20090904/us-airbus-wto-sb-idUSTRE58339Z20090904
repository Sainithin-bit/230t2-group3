 BERLIN  (Reuters) - Airbus sees a final verdict in the World Trade Organization ruling on subsidies in three to five years, a company spokesman said on Friday, and does not expect to have to make "gigantic repayments." 

 Rainer Ohler said the firm was relaxed about a WTO ruling due to be issued to U.S. and European diplomats in Geneva around 1400 GMT, before being reviewed by government and industry leaders in Brussels, Washington and around the world. "This won't change anything legally, this interim report is not more or less than a footnote," Ohler said, adding that the dispute would be resolved by negotiations and not the WTO. The three-member WTO dispute settlement panel is expected to agree with complainant Washington that the billions of euros of "launch aid" Airbus received to build the A380 and other top-selling planes was anti-competitive and broke trade laws. Such a finding could limit Airbus' options to finance new airliners, such as the wide-body A350 due in the next decade, and also affect how industry rivals in Brazil, Canada, China, Russia and Japan fuel their expansion. "The A350 is not the subject of the WTO arbitration process," Ohler said. (Reporting by Kerstin Doerr, Writing by Sarah Marsh)
