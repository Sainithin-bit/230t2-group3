 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The World Trade Organization on Friday ruled that European subsidies for the launch of the Airbus A380 airplane were illegal, The Wall Street Journal said in a report that cited a person familiar with the ruling. 

 Earlier on Friday, the WTO issued a 1,000-plus page ruling on whether the subsidies given to Airbus ( EAD.PA ) were illegal, although the findings will not officially be made public for months.
