 SANTA BARBARA, California  (Reuters) - Unemployment is a lagging indicator, and the U.S. jobless rate is likely to stay uncomfortably high for some time, Dallas Fed President Richard Fisher said on Thursday. 

 Taking questions after a speech in Santa Barbara, California, Fisher said he was "praying" that unemployment did not hit or exceed the 10-percent level. Fisher said the Fed should be held to account for mistakes made as regulators leading up to the 2007 financial crisis, but that it would be Congress' "biggest mistake" to infringe on the central bank's independence.
