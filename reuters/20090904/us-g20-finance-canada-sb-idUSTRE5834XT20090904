 LONDON  (Reuters) - Canada has concerns over whether all G20 members have met their commitments on economic stimulus and ensuring existing measures are pushed through should be the group's first priority, Finance Minister Jim Flaherty said on Friday. 

 In a briefing with reporters before a meeting of G20 finance ministers and central bankers, Flaherty repeatedly stressed the need for the G20 members to fulfill their existing obligations with regards to stimulus spending and financial regulations, made last April. When asked which area he felt his G20 colleagues had fallen short on, Flaherty said, "I think the most important area is stimulus spending by members of the G20. We all agreed that we would take steps to create substantial stimuli in our respective economies," he said. "A number of countries have tried to do that, Canada included ... it would be unwise for any economy to take the foot off the accelerator," he said.
