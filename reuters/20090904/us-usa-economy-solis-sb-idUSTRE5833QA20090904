 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. Labor Secretary Hilda Solis said on Friday that a jump in unemployment was unexpected but said declining job losses showed government support was cushioning job losses overall. 

 "I am somewhat surprised that we are seeing that continued rise in the unemployment figure, but we knew that was going to be happening and we know that it will continue for a few more months," she said in an interview with Reuters TV. "We're going to provide rescue and rebuilding of our economy and our workforce," she said. (Reporting by  Mark Felsenthal ; Editing by  James Dalgleish )
