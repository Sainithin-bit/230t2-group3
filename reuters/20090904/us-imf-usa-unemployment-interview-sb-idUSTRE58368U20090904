 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - A senior International Monetary Fund official said on Friday the jump in the U.S. unemployment rate in August to a 26-year high was a typical lag in the labor market as the country emerges from recession, and conditions should improve next year when the recovery picks up. 

 In an interview with Reuters, the IMF's mission chief to the United States, Charles Kramer, said the U.S. unemployment figures released on Friday were "in line with what we have been expecting." The Labor Department said the jobless rate climbed to 9.7 percent in August, the highest since June 1983, although job losses were the smallest in a year, showing a mixed picture of the economic recovery. The jobless rate suggests weak consumer spending may impede the recovery. "We see growth returning in a kind of a sustainable and strong fashion probably around the middle of next year," Kramer said. "That is when you'd see demand picking up, sort of the domestic situation improving, and maybe around then some momentum in the unemployment figures." "It's a typical pattern, frankly, for unemployment to adjust with a bit of a lag to the overall cycle in the economy," he said. Kramer said the IMF was in the process of revising its economic forecasts for the world. A document obtained by Reuters showed the IMF now sees the  world economy shrinking by 1.3 percent in 2009, a shade less than its earlier forecast of 1.4 percent, before growing by 2.9 percent in 2010, revised up from growth of 2.5 percent it expected in April. For the United States, the IMF now sees the economy shrinking by 2.9 percent this year, as opposed to a contraction of 2.6 percent it envisaged in its April outlook. For 2010, the IMF said the U.S. economy would expand by 1.2 percent, as opposed to the 0.8 percent it forecast in April. Kramer said the IMF expects the U.S. unemployment rate to crest somewhere over 10 percent as the economy moves through the recessionary phase. He said the U.S. recovery would be sluggish. "It is something very much in the shape of what we expected, which is a sluggish recovery against the background of significant headwinds from the balance sheet weaknesses in the financial sector." Kramer said U.S. government's monetary and fiscal measures to address the economic crisis were the "right response." "The overall message now is to stay the course on stimulus, keep it in place; we see some good signs that it's helping," he added. (Editing by Leslie Adler)
