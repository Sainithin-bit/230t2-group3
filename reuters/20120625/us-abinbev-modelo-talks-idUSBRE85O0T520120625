 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - Anheuser-Busch InBev ( ABI.BR ), the world's largest brewer, said on Monday it was in discussions with Mexican brewer Modelo ( GMODELOC.MX ) about increasing its stake in the Corona beer maker, but that it was too early to give details. 
 "There have been discussions between the company and Grupo Modelo regarding a possible transaction to expand its current relationship," AB InBev said in a statement. Sources told Reuters earlier that the Belgian-based group was in talks to buy the 50 percent of Modelo that it does not already own, in a potential deal that could top $10 billion. The Belgian regulator suspended AB Inbev's shares before the announcement by the company, which brews Budweiser and Stella Artois. (Reporting by Robert-Jan Bartunek; editing by  Rex Merrifield )
