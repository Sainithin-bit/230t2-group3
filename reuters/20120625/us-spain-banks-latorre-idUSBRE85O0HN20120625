 SANTANDER, Spain  (Reuters) - Spain's Economy Secretary Fernando Jimenez Latorre said on Monday that financial help from a European Union funded bailout for the country's struggling banks could be granted to the lenders within three to four months. 
 However, those with urgent financing needs would be helped through temporary liquidity mechanisms, Latorre said. (Reporting By Carlos Ruano, Writing by Paul Day; Editing by Jesus Aguado)
