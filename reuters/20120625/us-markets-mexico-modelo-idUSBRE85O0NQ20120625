 MEXICO CITY  (Reuters) - Shares of Mexican brewer Grupo Modelo surged more than 11 percent on Monday after reports that Anheuser-Busch InBev is nearing a deal to buy the 50 percent of the company it does not already own. 
 Trading of the stock was suspended on Mexico's IPC stock exchange in early dealings. A deal between Modelo ( GMODELOC.MX ), the maker of Corona beer, and the Belgian-based brewer Anheuser-Busch InBev ( ABI.BR ) could be clinched as early as this week, although the timing remains uncertain, The Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday. Anheuser-Busch InBev owns a 50 percent non-controlling stake in Modelo, Mexico's largest brewer. (Reporting by Rachel Uranga; editing by John Wallace)
