 MADRID  (Reuters) - Spain formally requested on Monday European aid of up to 100 billion euros for its banks, the Economy Ministry said in a statement. 
 Spain's Economy Minister Luis De Guindos said in the letter to Eurogroup chairman Jean-Claude Juncker that the final amount of the financial assistance would be set at a later stage but should be enough to cover all banks' needs plus an additional security buffer. He also confirmed his intention to sign a Memorandum of Understanding for the package, which would include full details, by July 9.
