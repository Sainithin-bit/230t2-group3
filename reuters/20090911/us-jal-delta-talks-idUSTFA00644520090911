 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Delta Air Lines, the world's biggest carrier, is in talks to take a stake in Japan Airlines Corp and forge a business alliance, a source familiar with the matter said on Friday. 

 The business alliance will likely include code-sharing on international flights, the source said, speaking on condition of anonymity because the deal has not been decided and the negotiations are not public. (Reporting by Taro Fuse; editing by John Stonestreet)
