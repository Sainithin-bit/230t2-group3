 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - Any state aid given in GM's sale of its Opel subsidiary must comply with European Union internal market rules and must not have any geographical conditions tied to its restructuring, the European Commission said on Friday. 

 "The Commission has underlined that the financial support must be fully compliant with all aspects of the EU state aid and internal market rules," a spokesman told reporters. GM's board opted on Thursday to sell Magna and its Russian partner Sberbank a 55 percent stake in Opel over a rival offer from Belgium-listed investor RHJ International. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who had lobbied for the Magna bid, has promised 4.5 billion euros ($6.6 billion) in government guarantees for the group. It expects other European states with Opel plants to contribute to this total. (Reporting by  Foo Yun Chee , editing by Timothy Heritage)
