 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The U.S. service sector expanded in September at a faster pace than expected, according to the Institute for Supply Management's services index. 

 The index rose to 50.9 last month from 48.4 in August, above economists' median forecast for a rise to 50.0. The dividing line between growth and contraction is 50. The services sector represents about 80 percent of U.S. economic activity, including businesses such as banks, airlines, hotels and restaurants. The employment subcomponent rose to 44.3 from 43.5. The U.S. job market strengthened in September for the first time since January of last year, suggesting a slow and rough road to recovery, the Conference Board, a private research group, said on Monday. Its Employment Trends Index edged up to 88.5 in September from an upwardly revised 88.2 in August, originally reported at 88.1. The index is now down 15.6 percent from one year ago, the group said. COMMENTS: ANTHONY NIEVES, CHAIR, ISM NON-MANUFACTURING BUSINESS SURVEY COMMITTEE, BEVERLY HILLS, CALIFORNIA: "The growth seems to be happening a little earlier than I anticipated. It has to continue month over month to show growth in this part of the economy to be sustainable... The baseline has moved so much over the past eleven months. This is where we thought it would be going based on the data. We thought it would turnaround around the fall. It's a month or so earlier than I thought. Based on new orders, I think we will continue this trend but I'd rather be cautious than overly optimistic." PETER BOOCKVAR, EQUITY STRATEGIST, MILLER TABAK + CO., NEW YORK: "The Sept ISM services index hit 50.9, almost 1 point more than expected, up from 48.4 and is the first time above 50 since Sept 2008, implying expansion in the non manufacturing sector. New Orders rose to 54.2 from 49.9 and Backlogs rose a sharp 10.5 pts to 51.5. Employment though remained sluggish, highlighted also by last week's data, rising 0.8 points to 44.3. Bottom line, the data over the past week is best described as Blah and while today's number was slightly better than expected, the recovery will clearly be bumpy." CARL LANTZ, U.S. INTEREST RATE STRATEGIST, CREDIT SUISSE,  NEW YORK: "I don't really think this changes the story that things are looking a little bit shakier now." "The (ISM) data did definitely look better, the one silver lining for the bond market was the prices. I think there is more disinflation to come. That is really what is going to underwrite the bond market rally." JOHN CANALLY, ECONOMIST, LPL FINANCIAL, BOSTON: "The market was due for some better than expected news after last week's wave of news that came in worse than expected." "We are getting an expansion in the service sector which makes a chunk of the economy. It's encouraging to see that inventory and backlogs are growing" "But a disappointment is that the job index is still below 50, which means companies are tentatively to hire. Another disappointment was a dip in new exports." "Still this may get people's mind to off the jobs report and make them look at more forward looking indicators." "For now, the recovery is still well in place." HUGH JOHNSON, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, JOHNSON ILLINGTON ADVISORS, ALBANY, NEW YORK: "It's good news. It's good news because it's above 50 and it's good news because it's above expectations. So given the fact that most of the numbers we saw recently last week, particularly the employment numbers, have been below expectations, this is kind of good news. "There was a fairly strong negative reaction to the employment numbers and when everyone looked carefully at the numbers we saw last week, they learned the numbers were not bad. It looks like the numbers we've seen recently are very consistent, collectively, with the idea that the economy is recovering and it will be coupled with somewhat higher inflation. Those are the stories that came out of last week, that is the story that comes out of today." WILLIAM BELLAMY, DIRECTOR OF FIXED INCOME, THOMPSON, SIEGEL & WALMSLEY IN RICHMOND, VIRGINIA: "The (ISM ) headline is a modest positive. I think we are still looking at fairly weak employment obviously, from what we saw on Friday. Until the trend changes a little bit more dramatically we will be in somewhat of a trading range in bonds." "For Treasuries, the trading range on the 10-year is now probably between 3.10 percent and 3.30 percent." "Corporate bonds (yield spreads over Treasuries) are a fair bit tighter today after pretty severe weakness last week. I think corporates will be pretty range bound as well because the amount of sell-off and widening last week caught a lot of people by surprise and they can only go so far." PETER JANKOVSKIS, CO-CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER AT OAKBROOK  INVESTMENTS LLC IN LISLE, ILLINOIS: "It's certainly a positive number. It will perhaps offset some of the negative impact that ISM manufacturing numbers had last week. In the grand scheme of things, service numbers are more important (than ISM manufacturing) because vast majority of jobs in the U.S. are in services. Moving into the holiday season, the numbers today could indicate that more jobs may be created to meet the holiday shopping needs but it's a bit soon to tell and we will have to wait and see if this improvement can be sustained. STEVE GOLDMAN, MARKET STRATEGIST AT WEEDEN & CO IN GREENWICH, CONNECTICUT: "The data is roughly in line, depending on which consensus you use. Coming into the session, we're pretty oversold (in the stockmarket) after the pullback we had last week, but getting help from the financial group after the upgrades we saw. The data is keeping the market momentum intact but its sort of going back and forth." MICHAEL WOOLFOLK, SENIOR CURRENCY STRATEGIST, BNY MELLON, NEW YORK: " This is a good way to start off the week after a sour nonfarm payrolls on Friday. The employment component of the ISM data improved, which was a welcome development, and business activity picked up handsomely. New orders are also up big. This is a solid report that is consistent with a glass-half-full outlook. From a big picture perspective, if we had to choose between the two ISM reports, this is the one we'd want to show improvement. We need to see the service sector doing better because it's such a big part of the economy." MARKET REACTION: STOCKS: U.S. stocks edged up after the data with the benchmark SP500 index around 1029 points. BONDS: U.S. Treasury debt prices were little changed with the benchmark 10-year yield around 3.18 pct DOLLAR: U.S. dollar was little changed against majors.
