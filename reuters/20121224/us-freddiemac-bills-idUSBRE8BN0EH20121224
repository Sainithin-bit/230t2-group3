 (Reuters) - Freddie Mac ( FMCC.OB ), the No. 2 U.S. home funding company, said it will sell $2.0 billion worth of reference bills on Monday. 
 The sale consists of $1.0 billion of three-month bills March 25, 2013, and $1.0 billion of six-month bills due June 24, 2013. The bills will be sold over the Internet in a Dutch auction. In such uniform price auctions, successful bidders pay only the price of the lowest accepted bid rather than the actual price as in a conventional multiple-price auction. Bids will be accepted from authorized dealers until 9:45 a.m. EST (1445 GMT). Settlement is December 26 (Reporting by Caryn Trokie; Editing by  Chizu Nomiyama )
