 (Lawyer clarified he is seeking class action status for suit  filed today) 

 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Attorney Jeffrey Killino, whose lawsuit helped lead to a recall of defective Chinese-made tires, filed a lawsuit against Mattel Inc on Monday due to the recent recalls of toys that might have contained excessive amounts of lead paint, and is seeking class action status. Killino said in a statement the suit is aimed at forcing the world's largest toy maker to pay for the testing of children who might have gotten lead poisoning from the toys, which were made in China. Last week, Mattel recalled 436,000 die-cast toy cars from its "Cars" line because they may have contained excessive amounts of lead, which can cause brain damage in children.
