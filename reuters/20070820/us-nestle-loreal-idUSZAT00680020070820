 ZURICH  (Reuters) - Nestle ( NESN.VX ), the world's largest food company, said on Monday it was considering all options for its stake in French cosmetics firm L'Oreal ( OREP.PA ) but that it was under no time pressure to make a decision. 

 "It is irresponsible to say now what we do now with L'Oreal when you have this huge benefit of time to think about it properly and consider all the options," said Chief Financial Officer Paul Polman in a webcast. "L'Oreal has been a very good investment for Nestle and continues to be," he said. L'Oreal, the world's largest cosmetics firm, has a market value of $70 billion. Nestle has around a 28 percent stake in L'Oreal, according to Reuters data.
