 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Thornburg Mortgage Inc. TMA.N expects to be profitable on an operating basis in the third quarter and on an ongoing basis, its chief operating officer said in an interview with CNBC television on Monday. 

 Larry Goldstone also said there was a crisis in investor confidence in the mortgage space. Thornburg shares were down $1.38, or 8.9 percent in early trading on the New York Stock Exchange after Goldstone's comments. (Reporting by  Christian Plumb )
