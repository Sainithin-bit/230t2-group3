 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Countrywide Financial Corp sought to reassure customers on Monday it is safe to do business with the company, while a published report said the largest U.S. mortgage lender has begun layoffs to help cope with a credit crunch. 

 The company ran full-page advertisements in Monday editions of The New York Times and other newspapers assuring readers problems in the mortgage market do not affect the safety of federally insured deposits at its Countrywide Bank unit. It also said the bank is "well capitalized" and that "the future is bright." Countrywide ran the ads after the Wall Street Journal, citing an internal e-mail, said Countrywide's Full Spectrum Lending unit has begun laying off employees. Full Spectrum offers mortgages to people with less than "prime" credit or who cannot fully document income or assets. The unit's sales force on June 30 numbered about 6,785 people, or 38 percent of Countrywide's total sales force of 18,091. Any job cuts would reverse the trend from January to July, when Countrywide added nearly 7,000 employees as smaller rivals fell away. It said it ended July with 61,586 employees. Rick Simon, a Countrywide spokesman, declined to provide a copy of the e-mail or confirm its contents. Fear about Countrywide's stability grew after the Calabasas, California-based company last week unexpectedly tapped an entire $11.5 billion credit line to help fund operations. At least two Wall Street analysts said the company could end up in bankruptcy if market conditions worsen. Customers flocked to Countrywide branches last Thursday and Friday, worried their money was not safe, even with Federal Deposit Insurance Corp backing. Like many mortgage lenders, Countrywide has struggled with rising delinquencies and foreclosures, and an unwillingness among bankers to extend credit, and among investors to buy the loans it makes. Analysts have said difficult market conditions may force Countrywide to reduce mortgage lending. The company's shares were downgraded on Monday to "underperform" from "market perform" by Frederick Cannon, a Keefe, Bruyette & Woods Inc analyst. Cannon said a loss of thrift deposits poses a "meaningful risk" that could reduce profitability and that "the likelihood of a dilutive capital raise or a distressed sale" has risen. He said Countrywide can survive without such actions, but will have an "impaired ability" to compete with large bank rivals. Countrywide shares closed $1.62, or 7.6 percent, lower at$19.81 on Monday on the New York Stock Exchange. They have fallen 53 percent this year.
