 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Nasdaq Stock Market Inc. ( NDAQ.O ) Chief Executive Robert Greifeld on Monday said the U.S. exchange operator remains fully committed to its proposed merger with OMX, a Nordic bourse company, and that it remains flexible in how it structures a deal. 

 Greifeld, who spoke to analysts after Nasdaq announced it wanted to sell its 31 percent stake in London Stock Exchange Group Plc ( LSE.L ), said investment bank advisers were already in touch with "a number of interested parties." (Reporting by  Joseph Giannone )
