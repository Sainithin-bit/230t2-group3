 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Target Corp ( TGT.N ) reaffirmed its August same-store sales forecast of 4 percent to 6 percent growth on Monday in a sign the No. 2 U.S. discount retailer may be weathering a period of sluggish consumer spending that has affected Wal-Mart Stores Inc ( WMT.N ). 

 Target gave its estimate for August same-store sales -- a key measure of retail performance -- earlier this month, and the company, which reports August sales on September 6, is scheduled to report second-quarter earnings on Tuesday. Last week, rival Wal-Mart, the world's largest retailer, posted quarterly profit below Wall Street estimates, saying that economic pressures including higher fuel prices, interest rates and utility costs were affecting its lower-income customer's spending habits. While Wal-Mart, which has been struggling with slowing U.S. sales growth, posted a 1.9 percent rise in July same-store sales, Target reported a 6.1 percent rise, topping analysts' expectations. Target shares closed at $59.09, down 3.4 percent, or $2.09, on the New York Stock Exchange. (Reporting by  Alexandria Sage , editing by Richard Chang/Andre Grenon/Jeffrey Benkoe)
