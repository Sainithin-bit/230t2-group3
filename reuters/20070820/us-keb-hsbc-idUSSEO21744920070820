 SEOUL/HONG KONG  (Reuters) - HSBC Holdings Plc ( HSBA.L ) said on Monday it was in talks to buy a majority stake in Korea Exchange Bank 004940.KS worth $4.8 billion from Lone Star, a move that could flush out a domestic counterbidder. 

 Top South Korean bank Kookmin 060000.KS, whose $7.3 billion offer for KEB last year was stymied by a lengthy legal dispute, said it was still interested in KEB, raising the possibility of a bid battle for the country's fifth-ranked lender. And HSBC may face further domestic competition in the form of Hana Financial Group ( 086790.KS ), which said earlier this month it was watching the situation at KEB with interest. Han Jeong-tae, an analyst at Hana Daetoo Securities, said South Korean authorities could prefer a local bidder if one were to put in a counter-bid. "If KEB is sold to HSBC, it will mark a third major Korean bank bought by foreign players. The regulator won't like it very much." The protracted legal dispute between Dallas-based private equity fund Lone Star, which holds 51 percent of KEB, and South Korean authorities could yet cast a shadow over future deals, analysts said. "With more than one failed attempt by foreigners to acquire KEB, we believe skepticism on deal approval remains in place," JPMorgan banking analyst Sunil Garg said in a note on Monday. HSBC, which has tried repeatedly to buy a bigger presence in the South Korean banking market, said it planned to maintain KEB's name and listing status if a deal was completed. KEB and Lone Star LS.UL declined to comment on the deal. Foreign banks keen to enter Korea may find acquisitions are the only option left, given the government's reluctance to allow new entrants into the crowded banking sector. Acquiring a bank is the quickest way for an outsider to get established in the competitive but lucrative market for financial services, including asset management, in Asia's fourth-largest economy. Citigroup ( C.N ) and Standard Chartered ( STAN.L ) ( 2888.HK ) became major players by buying domestic rivals, which HSBC had also attempted to buy. South Korea is Standard Chartered's second-biggest market. "HSBC does not have a strong physical presence in Korea now. It can expand its branch network and business in Korea through acquiring KEB," said Wong Kwok-wai, a banking analyst at BOC International. KEB shares closed 7.3 percent higher at 13,950 won, outpacing the wider market's  .KS11  5.7 percent gain. LENGTHY PROCESS AHEAD Several analysts said HSBC should brace for a long, hard battle to get its KEB purchase approved, with legal issues still to be resolved and the possibility of regulatory opposition. South Korean prosecutors say a former government official colluded with a lawyer hired by Lone Star and KEB's chief executive to inflate KEB's losses, allowing Lone Star to buy it in 2003 for around $900 million less than it was worth. A local buyout fund executive said HSBC would have taken a good look at the legal issues to avoid shouldering all the risk alone, and now may be a good time for Lone Star to exit its controversial investment in South Korea. "Earnings at KEB have grown substantially. It has paid handsome dividends and seen its corporate value rise since the sale process was delayed," said the fund executive, asking not to be named. Goodmorning Shinhan Securities analyst Hong Jin-pyo said HSBC had a good chance of succeeding with its bid as the South Korean government would view the London-based global bank as a good fit. Singapore's DBS ( DBSM.SI ), a previous KEB suitor, broke off talks in June. An official at the Financial Supervisory Commission told Reuters the regulator would wait for a final court ruling before giving the nod to any possible KEB sale by Lone Star. "Presumably what HSBC is offering is a clean, non-contingent, cash-based exit which they certainly have the financial capacity to do, and, on the other hand, they'd probably want some give-up there in terms of price," said Bill Stacey, banking analyst at Credit Suisse in Hong Kong. KEB trades at around 8.5 times forecast earnings, according to Reuters' data, in line with Kookmin and second-ranked Shinhan Financial Group ( 055550.KS ).
