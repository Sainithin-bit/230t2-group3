 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. blue-chip stocks ended higher on Monday after yields on short-term Treasury bills came off their session lows, suggesting the flight to safety had slowed and investors were dipping into riskier assets. 

 The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index also advanced, while the S&P 500 inched lower at the close. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  was up 41.21 points, or 0.32 percent, to end unofficially at 13,120.29. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  was down 0.39 of a point, or 0.03 percent, to finish unofficially at 1,445.55. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  was up 3.56 points, or 0.14 percent, to close unofficially at 2,508.59.
