 LONDON  (Reuters) - BP Plc ( BP.L ) slashed its short and medium-term growth targets, hitting the oil giant's shares, as it reported better-than-expected, but falling, fourth-quarter profits. 


 The world's third-largest fully publicly traded oil company by market value on Tuesday forecast production would fall to 3.8 million to 3.9 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) in 2007, from 3.93 million boepd in 2006, which was down 2 percent on 2005. BP added production would grow to 4 million boepd in 2009. Dresdner Kleinwort said the new figures represented growth of 1.4 percent per annum between 2005 and 2009 compared with BP's earlier plans to grow at 4 percent per annum. BP shares, which fell in 2006 after a series of safety, regulatory and environmental problems, closed down 1.2 percent at 535 pence, compared with a 0.52 percent drop in the DJ Stoxx European oil and gas sector index .SXEP. Merrill Lynch cut its earnings targets and share price target for the company after the statement. BP blamed the reduction in targets on delays in key projects, field sales, tightness in the market for oil field services, increased safety costs and reduced entitlements under production-sharing contracts due to higher oil prices. Last month Chief Executive John Browne said he would step down 17 months early, handing over to exploration boss Tony Hayward, to end uncertainty about the firm's leadership, after a spat with chairman Peter Sutherland over Browne's retirement date. Jonathan Wright at Citigroup suggested the reduced targets were intended to help the new CEO shine. PROFITS DOWN BP posted a 12 percent drop in its fourth-quarter replacement cost net profit, which strips out changes in the value of inventories, to $3.895 billion as production fell and taxes and costs rose faster than oil prices. Hayward said oil sector cost inflation was 14 percent in 2006, while oil prices rose 5 percent. Excluding a $152 million charge related to non-operating items, the profit was $4.047 billion, ahead of an average forecast of $3.91 billion in a Reuters poll of 13 analysts. The result echoes falling fourth quarter profits at rivals Exxon Mobil Corp ( XOM.N ) and Chevron Corp ( CVX.N ), as a two year spiral in oil prices slowed, highlighting weakened margins. BP's full-year profit was up 15 percent at $22.3 billion, thanks to higher oil prices across 2006 compared with 2005. BP added that capital expenditure would have to rise more than expected, even to achieve the lower goals, further compromising future profits and cashflow. Capital expenditure of around $18 billion is now forecast for 2007, up from a previously indicated $15.5 billion. Investors are becoming used to paying more to receive less growth from oil companies. Last week, Royal Dutch Shell Plc ( RDSa.L ) raised its investment budget and cut back growth targets. The rise in BP's capex also reflects higher spending on safety at U.S. refineries after regulators partly blamed a fatal blast at Texas City on cost cutting. The company is also expected to spend more on pipelines maintenance after oil spills in Alaska last year. Balancing the bad news, BP said it had a good year with the drill bit, finding more oil than it produced. The company's proved reserves replacement ratio was 113 percent, excluding acquisitions and disposals. BP's shares traded at a premium to rivals for most of this decade because investors believed BP management could continue to deliver higher and more reliable growth than Shell and peers. This premium was eroded in the past 12 months, leading many analysts to suggest the shares now looked cheap and would re-rate versus the sector as soon as memories of last year's bad news faded. Citigroup's Wright said a recovery now depended on tangible results. "It is difficult to see relative outperformance unless the company can start delivering positive surprises relative to expectations." BP said it would pay a fourth-quarter dividend of 10.325 cents, or 5.258 pence, up 10.1 percent on the year in dollar terms. (Additional reporting by  Anshuman Daga  and Dan Lalor)
