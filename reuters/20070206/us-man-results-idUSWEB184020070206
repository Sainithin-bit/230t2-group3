 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Operating profit at German industrial group MAN AG ( MANG.DE ) rose 57 percent to 354 million euros ($457.6 million) in the fourth quarter, it said on Tuesday, beating market expectations. 


 Analysts polled by Reuters had on average expected fourth-quarter operating profit of 334 million euros amid a boom at its core commercial vehicles division. MAN, which last month dropped its hostile bid for Swedish truckmaker Scania ( SCVb.ST ), also said it remained open to "mutually acceptable solutions" for a deal to create Europe's truck-market leader.
