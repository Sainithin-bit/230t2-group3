 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Satellite data and voice communications provider Globalstar Inc. GSAT.O said in a filing on Tuesday that worsening problems with its satellites may threaten its ability to provide uninterrupted two-way voice and data services. 


 Shares in the company, which went public at $17 in November, fell 28 percent to close at $10.40 on the Nasdaq. Globalstar previously said many of its satellites are suffering from degraded performance of the amplifiers for the S-band satellite communications antenna. In its filing on Tuesday it said the rate of degradation of the amplifiers has accelerated. "Unless remedied, by some time in 2008 this will have a significant adverse impact on the company's ability to provide uninterrupted two-way voice and data services on a continuous basis in any given location," Globalstar said in the filing. The company said it continues to pursue a technical solution to this amplifier problem, but to date has been unable to correct it and may be unable to do so. Globalstar said the problem does not hurt its Simplex satellite data services.
