 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Blue chips were little changed on Tuesday as bank stocks rose, helping to pare losses triggered by microchip maker National Semiconductor Corp. ( NSM.N ) cutting its quarterly revenue forecast. 


 Oil futures retreated after having rallied over 1 percent as a cold front swept across the U.S. northeast, and the dip soothed some concern about how higher energy prices may impact consumer spending. Technology stocks fell as the decline in National Semiconductor shares dragged down Cisco Systems Inc. ( CSCO.O ) and Microsoft Corp. ( MSFT.O ). But financials rose, helped by a rally in Citigroup ( C.N ), which was the biggest positive influence on both the Dow and the S&P 500. "You had oil up a dollar and change this morning ... it's back to below $59 ... and that's certainly helping the market," said Victor Pugliese, director of listed equity trading at First Albany Corp. in San Francisco. "You've had banks under pressure the last couple of days, people talking about subprime lending and how some of the bigger mortgage banks were going to have problems, and that seems to have shaken off a bit," he said. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  edged down 6.97 points, or 0.06 percent, to 12,654.77, while the Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  dipped 0.74 points, or 0.05 percent, to 1,446.25 and the Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  fell 5.67 points, or 0.23 percent, to 2,464.93. National Semi shares shed 3.3 percent to $22.55 on the New York Stock Exchange, hitting rival stocks as it cut its shipment forecasts.  Shares of network equipment maker Cisco Systems fell 0.6 percent to $27.35. The company reports earnings after the bell and is viewed as a bellwether for the broader tech sector. Microsoft shares extended this week's fall, dropping 0.4 percent to $29.50, and making it one of the biggest drags on the Nasdaq 100, on concern the company's new Vista operating system may not help maintain the stock's recent rally. Crude for March delivery CLc1 was up 22 cents at $58.96 a barrel, having touched a high of $59.99, which helped stem the S&P 500's declines along with a rise in financial stocks. Merrill Lynch raised its price targets on Goldman Sachs ( GS.N ) and rival brokerages Lehman Brothers LEH.N and Bear Stearns Cos. BSC.N, boosting the brokerage sector and pushing the S&P Financial Services Index .GSPF up 0.5 percent. Goldman rose 0.8 percent to $214.40, Lehman rose 0.4 percent to $85.67, while Bear Stearns rose 0.7 percent to $166.19. Shares of rival Citigroup Inc. ( C.N ) were the top positive influence on the S&P, rising 0.7 percent to $55.14. The broader market was also helped by strong profits from several companies, including cosmetics company Avon Products Inc. ( AVP.N ). Shares of Avon gained 10.7 percent to $38.32, making it one of the NYSE's biggest percentage gainers after its earnings topped Wall Street's estimates. <ID:nN06202613>.
