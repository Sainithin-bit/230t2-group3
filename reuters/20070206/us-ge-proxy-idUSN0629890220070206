 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - General Electric Co. ( GE.N ) on Tuesday urged shareholders to approve a plan for directors in uncontested elections to be approved by a majority vote, but opposed a proposal requiring separation of the chairman and chief executive roles. 


 The majority-vote proposal would strengthen a policy that GE adopted in 2006 that required current directors who failed to receive a majority of votes to resign and the board to have a compelling reason not to accept the resignation. GE opposes eight shareholder proposals, including separating the chairman and CEO positions. Its annual meeting is scheduled for April 25 in Greenville, South Carolina.
