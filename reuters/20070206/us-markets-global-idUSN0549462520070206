 LONDON  (Reuters) - Global stocks hit record highs on Tuesday amid solid earnings and signs of consumer strength while the yen retreated from three-week highs, proving reluctant to break key resistance ahead of a weekend Group of Seven meeting. 


 Oil bounced back above $59 a barrel as the coldest weather of the U.S. winter was expected to increase demand for heating oil. Gold edged above $650 an ounce. The yen touched a peak at 120 per dollar  JPY=  but retreated at that key psychological level ahead of the G7 meeting which starts in Essen, Germany on Friday. With U.S. Federal Reserve officials including Ben Bernanke speaking later on Tuesday and the European Central Bank meeting on Thursday, markets could stay in tight ranges, analysts said. "Ahead of Thursday plus the G7 I think we've found a base," said Michael Klawitter, currency strategist at Dresdner Kleinwort in Frankfurt. "It looks as if now, with dollar/yen rejecting the 120 level, it is really the widespread view that the G7 won't come out with an explicit comment on the yen so the funding currencies will be sold again once the markets open on Monday morning after the G7," he added. At 1040 GMT, the dollar traded at 120.35 yen, little changed on the day, while the euro was up 0.1 percent at 155.80 yen EURJPY=. The euro also rose 0.1 percent against the dollar to $1.2940  EUR= . STOCKS MARK FRESH HIGHS Stocks continued to mark out fresh record highs, buoyed by a benign view of the global economy and mostly upbeat earnings and outlooks from companies. The MSCI All-Country World Index .MSCIWD hit an all-time high at 376 points, while Europe's FTSEurofirst 300 Index  .FTEU3  rose 0.5 percent to hit a fresh-six-year peak of 1,545.9 points. "Sentiment's reasonably optimistic," said Graham Secker, an equity strategist at Morgan Stanley. "There's a lot of bid activity and that kind of frothiness out there." "Provided commodity prices don't fall too far, the earnings that these companies will generate still makes their valuations look very attractive ... so we're quite optimistic. British retailers including supermarket heavyweight Tesco ( TSCO.L ) lent support after data showed British retail sales enjoyed their strongest January in three years, raising hopes of continued good earnings growth. Euro zone retail sales data for December came in weaker-than-expected at 0.3 percent despite a jump in German spending ahead of the new year rise in value added tax. On the downside, oil major BP ( BP.L ) fell 1.8 percent after reporting a 12 percent fall in profit amid rising costs and falling production. ASIA IMPRESSES Markets in Asia fared well despite a lackluster performance on Wall Street overnight, where technology stocks weighed. MSCI's index of Asian shares excluding Japan .MSCIAPJ rose 0.6 percent to a record high, with Australia's benchmark index .AXJO hitting an all-time peak. "The market is still keenly sought after," said Paul Xiradis, chief executive of fund manager Ausbil Dexia Ltd. in Australia. "Leading into the reporting season, the market has gone through a few upgrades ... The lead from companies is also suggestive that the results should be okay," he said. Tokyo's Nikkei index  .N225  closed nearly 0.4 percent higher on strong company results and outlooks, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng index  .HSI  rose 1 percent. Euro zone government bonds edged up, helped by the softer retail sales data, but remained in tight ranges. The March Bund future FGBLH7 rose nine ticks to 115.61 while the yield on the benchmark 10-year note EU10YT=RR dipped 1.9 basis points to 4.017 percent.
