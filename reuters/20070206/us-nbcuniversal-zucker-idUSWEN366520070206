 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - NBC Universal named Jeff Zucker chief executive on Tuesday, a widely expected move that caps the swift rise of the 41-year-old executive charged with improving results for its TV network and presiding over a digital media make-over. 


 Zucker succeeds Bob Wright, 63, who is stepping down after two decades at the helm of NBC, the company said. NBC is 80 percent owned by blue-chip conglomerate General Electric Co. ( GE.N ) and 20 percent by France's Vivendi ( VIV.PA ). Wright, who expanded NBC from a top U.S. broadcast network into a global media company spanning movie studios and Internet communities, will continue to serve as a GE vice chairman. "Jeff will succeed one of the true giants in media -- Bob Wright -- to whom we owe a tremendous debt of gratitude for helping to build this great media company," GE CEO Jeffrey Immelt said in a statement. Zucker's appointment, effective immediately, vaults him from his current role as CEO of the NBC Universal television group. In that role, Zucker struggled to turn around the NBC network from a prime-time slump since comedy hits "Friends" and "Frasier" came to an end more than two years ago. But after plunging to last place in 2005 among the four major broadcasters, NBC finished the opening 16 weeks of the current season tied for first place with rivals CBS and ABC for viewers aged 18 to 49, the group most prized by advertisers. NBC Universal has come under greater scrutiny from GE investors in recent months, stoking speculation a successor for Wright would soon be named. "He's got a lot of challenges facing him, as do his counterparts at the other networks -- namely, how to pull in an audience and hold on to an audience," said Bill Simon, a senior partner in Korn/Ferry International's media practice. "It's probably one of the most challenging times in the industry," he added, noting the competition for consumers from the Internet and other new media. Indeed, Zucker will preside over attempts to take advantage of the explosive growth in new digital media outlets -- from the Web to mobile phones and music players. NBCU OVERHAUL To succeed, however, Zucker also will need to reinvigorate the NBC broadcast network, some investors said. "You have to have shows in prime time that people want to watch. The rest is noise," said Richard Steinberg, president of Steinberg Global Asset Management, a Boca Raton, Florida-based firm that counts GE among its largest holdings. "It's going to be a show-me story with him," he said. "Can he get the NBC News ratings up and can he get prime-time shows that people care about?" Moving in to Wright's position may give Zucker more freedom to shake up the network, Steinberg said. NBC Universal is cutting about 700 jobs, or 5 percent of its work force, to slash costs. At the same time, it expects revenue from digital operations such as Internet or mobile entertainment to exceed $1 billion by 2009. Zucker will oversee that transition as the new head of NBC Universal, a promotion that was widely anticipated and the subject of media speculation for several months. Zucker has been considered a rising star in TV since he became became the youngest executive producer for the top-rated "Today" morning show at age 26. Thought of as a more casual and creative executive than Wright, Zucker joined NBC as a researcher for its Olympics coverage in 1986 after graduating from Harvard College with a history degree. Wright became chairman and chief executive officer of NBC Universal in May 2004 as part of the combination of NBC and Vivendi Universal Entertainment. He became president and chief executive officer of NBC in 1986. GE shares were down 3 cents at $36.34 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
