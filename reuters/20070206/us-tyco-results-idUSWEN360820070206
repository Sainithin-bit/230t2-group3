 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Conglomerate Tyco International Ltd. ( TYC.N ), which is in the process of splitting into three publicly traded companies, reported higher quarterly profit on Tuesday, citing increased demand for its electronics and fire and security technology. 


 But shares fell 2 percent as analysts said the company's near-term outlook provided few details. Net earnings rose 43 percent to $793 million, or 39 cents per share, in the first quarter ended December 29, from $556 million, or 27 cents per share, a year earlier. The profit was 45 cents per share, excluding charges for restructuring and for the split-up into three companies, which was 1 cent ahead of Wall Street expectations, according to Reuters Estimates. "There was a lot of noise, a lot of moving parts in the quarter with all the separation costs," said Mike McGarr, portfolio manager at Becker Capital Management, a Portland, Oregon-based company that manages about $2.5 billion in assets and owns Tyco shares. McGarr noted that the company did not provide a second-quarter earnings per share forecast. "They did give us some sort of broad-brush numbers, so maybe some people are looking at that absence of guidance and using it to take it down," he said. Tyco, which plans to spin off its health care and electronics divisions early in the second quarter, was optimistic about the global economic environment despite slowing in some electronics markets. It expects second-quarter sales to rise 6 percent to 7 percent. Analyst Stephen Tusa of JP Morgan said in a note to clients he will likely lower his 2007 earnings estimates, saying "guidance looks light." Revenue rose 8 percent to $10.3 billion, beating Wall Street expectations. Three of Tyco's four divisions posted higher first-quarter sales and higher operating profits, but its health-care segment reported lower profit because of restructuring and other charges. The electronics segment reported strong demand from the automotive and industrial sectors, offset by lower growth in computers and communications. Tyco said it expected demand from telecommunications customers to improve in the second half of the year. Tyco shares, which had closed at a 52-week high on Monday, were down 64 cents at $32.57 on the New York Stock Exchange. (Additional reporting by  Scott Malone  in Boston)
