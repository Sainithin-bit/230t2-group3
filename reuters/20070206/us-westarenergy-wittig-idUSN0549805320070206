 KANSAS CITY, Missouri  (Reuters) - A federal judge resentenced David Wittig, the former chief executive of Westar Energy Inc. ( WR.N ), to 24 months in prison for bank fraud on Monday. 


 Judge Julie Robinson, sitting in the U.S. District Court for Kansas, also ordered Wittig to pay a $1 million fine. Wittig and co-defendant, banker Clinton Odell Weidner, II, were convicted in July 2003 for conspiring to conceal a $1.5 million extension of credit that Wittig received from a Topeka bank where Weidner was the chief executive. The jury found the pair guilty of conspiring to conceal that Weidner used the money to make a down payment on a real estate development in Scottsdale, Ariz. The resentencing was required because the 10th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals ruled that Wittig's previous sentence of 60 months was calculated in error. Wittig, who was head of the largest electric energy provider in Kansas, also was convicted in a separate case of looting Westar and was sentenced to 18 years in prison. But last month an appeals court threw out that conviction saying evidence of guilt was insufficient. The government has not determined whether or not it will seek to retry Wittig in that case.
