 HONG KONG  (Reuters) - U.S. computer firm IBM ( IBM.N ) raised US$123 million by selling about 3.5 percent of number three global PC maker Lenovo Group Ltd. ( 0992.HK ), a term sheet showed, triggering a 7 percent share slide before a suspension kicked in. 


 IBM sold 300 million shares at HK$3.20 each -- the bottom of an indicated price range, according to the term sheet obtained by Reuters, unloading nearly a quarter of its holdings in the Chinese computer giant. That share slide wiped out gains that Lenovo's stock had made since Thursday, when it reported its fastest pace of quarterly earnings growth, for the October to December period, since buying IBM's ailing PC arm for US$1.25 billion in 2005. Under that deal, IBM hade been entitled to sell a third of its shares every year between May 2006 and May 2008. But it struck a deal last year that allowed it to exit its holding by November 2007 -- six months earlier than agreed. "The trading of Lenovo shares had been suspended at our request, pending the release of...price-sensitive information related to the placing of Lenovo shares by IBM," a Lenovo spokeswoman said. "Trading will resume at the earliest possible time." IBM, which had owned about 15 percent of the Chinese company, sold the shares at a discount of 7 percent to the stock's Monday close, in a deal handled by Citigroup Inc. ( C.N ). Big Blue had eyed selling the shares at a range of HK$3.20 to HK$3.30 each. (US$=HK$7.8)
