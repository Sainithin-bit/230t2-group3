 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp. ( 7203.T ) on Tuesday reiterated its group-based global vehicle sales forecast for the 2006/07 business year of 8.47 million units, though it tweaked some of its regional forecasts. 


 It expects its sales in North America to come to 2.9 million units, up from 2.87 million, and 2.29 million units in Japan instead of the 2.36 million units it projected three months ago. The figures include sales at truck maker Hino Motors Ltd. ( 7205.T ) and compact car maker Daihatsu Motor Co. ( 7262.T ). Japan's top auto maker also said it is now assuming an average dollar rate of 116 yen and a euro rate of 147 yen for the business year to the end of March instead of the 115 yen and 145 yen rates it assumed three months ago.
