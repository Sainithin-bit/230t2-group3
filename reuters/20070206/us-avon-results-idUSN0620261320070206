 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Avon Products Inc. ( AVP.N ), the world's largest direct seller of cosmetics, on Tuesday reported higher-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings as it pressed ahead with its restructuring program, sending shares up nearly 11 percent to a 19-month high. 


 Key markets are responding well to the turnaround initiatives, which have been in place since late 2005, and Avon should stay on course in 2007, Chief Executive Andrea Jung said on a conference call. Profit rose to $184.1 million, or 41 cents per share, from $183.2 million, or 40 cents per share, a year earlier. Analysts on average expected 38 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. "This is real improvement from Avon, and gives reason for long-term bullishness," said Bear Stearns analyst Justin Hott, who has a "peer perform" rating on the stock. Revenue rose 9 percent to $2.8 billion. Avon, which called 2006 a transitional year, unveiled a comprehensive restructuring in late 2005, cutting jobs and increasing advertising spending, among other steps to win back customers who have cut down on purchases or switched to competitors' new products. In the latest move in that direction, Avon said in January that it would close distribution centers in Delaware and Illinois and open one in the Midwest, which will employ 500 people and be able to ship half of its U.S. sales volume. Avon's shares were up $3.36, or 9.7 percent, at $37.98 in morning New York Stock Exchange trading after rising to $38.37, their highest price since July 2005. The company plans to outline its 2007 outlook and discuss its restructuring plan on February 15 in an investor conference in New York.
