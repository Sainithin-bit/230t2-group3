 LONDON  (Reuters) - BP Plc ( BP.L ) said on Tuesday it was unlikely a deal could be reached with Venezuela by May 1 on the OPEC member country's plan to strip some of the world's oil giants of their controlling stakes in heavy oil projects. 


 "It's probably optimistic to believe that negotiations can be completed by May 1," Chief Executive-designate Tony Hayward told a press conference. Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez vowed last week to strip controlling stakes held by firms like BP, Chevron ( CVX.N ), Exxon Mobil ( XOM.N ), ConocoPhillips ( COP.N ) and Statoil ( STL.OL ) in the heavy oil projects of the country's Orinoco belt by May 1.
