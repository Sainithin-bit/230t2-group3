 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp. ( 7203.T ) posted a near-20 percent rise in quarterly profit on Tuesday on brisk sales in North America and Europe, and kept its forecasts for a seventh straight year of record earnings intact. 


 Japan's top auto maker is cruising past rivals at home and abroad, riding a reputation for making energy-efficient cars, boosted by the halo effect from its popular Prius hybrid and backed by a steady stream of new or refreshed products such as the RAV4 crossover, Lexus LS and Camry sedans. Toyota's results confirmed its lead over domestic rivals Honda Motor Co. ( 7267.T ) and Nissan Motor Co. ( 7201.T ), which announced disappointing quarterly results last week. Toyota is storming the United States market, the world's biggest, winning sales from General Motors Corp. ( GM.N ) and Ford Motor Co. ( F.N ), both of which are undergoing painful restructuring. GM, Ford and Chrysler DCXGn.DE all lost market share to Asian brands last year. Last month, Toyota snatched the No.2 spot in the U.S. market from Ford with an adjusted 5 percent increase in sales. The Camry was again the top-selling car in the U.S. last year. Toyota, already the world's most valuable automaker with a market worth of $230 billion and poised to take over as the top carmaker by volume, kept its forecast for full-year operating profit of 2.2 trillion yen ($18.31 billion) and net profit of 1.55 trillion yen. But those projections are based on conservative assumptions for the dollar to average 115 yen and the euro to trade at 145 yen during the final quarter, leaving room for an overshoot. "We want to do a little bit better then 2.2 trillion yen (operating profit) since the yen is weaker," Toyota Senior Managing Director Takeshi Suzuki told reporters. October-December operating profit rose 19 percent to 574.79 billion yen ($4.78 billion), with higher vehicle sales helping to add 120 billion yen. The weaker yen contributed a quarter of that, while cost-cutting efforts added 20 billion yen. The result beat an average estimate of 559.2 billion yen in a survey of four brokerages by Reuters Estimates. Net profit rose 7.3 percent to 426.77 billion yen, well ahead of market estimates for a fall to 375.5 billion yen from a year earlier, when Toyota benefited from a one-off gain on securities holdings. FROM STRENGTH TO STRENGTH "The earnings numbers themselves are good and showed the strength of Toyota, especially in the North American market," said Mitsushige Akino, chief fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management. While third-quarter sales volume surged 19 percent in the key North American region, profitability worsened as expected due to heavy investment outlays to add more local production capacity -- in Texas, Canada and Indiana. Toyota's Suzuki stressed, however, that profit margins should recover once the products to be built at those factories -- the Tundra, RAV4 and Camry -- begin to hit dealerships soon. That should help ease the pressure on margins from a recent slowdown in Prius sales, which have been carrying discounts and other incentives -- their first ever -- since last month in the United States after tax credits on the car halved in October. With U.S. sales of its smaller models such as the Camry, Yaris and RAV4 in high gear, Toyota is focusing its marketing on the remodeled Tundra full-sized pickup truck to attack the last bastion of the Detroit Big Three. The Tundra is due to hit showrooms later this month. At the same time, Toyota plans to increase production of the fuel-sipping Prius, its flagship gasoline-electric car, in Japan by 55 percent this year to 280,000 units. Toyota reaffirmed it expects to sell 8.47 million units worldwide in the year to March 31, with its U.S. sales forecast rising slightly to 2.9 million units from 2.87 million projected three months ago. It downgraded its Japanese sales forecast to 2.29 million units from an earlier 2.36 million. The figures include sales at truck maker Hino Motors Ltd. ( 7205.T ) and compact car maker Daihatsu Motor Co. ( 7262.T ). Koichi Ogawa, chief portfolio manager at Daiwa SB Investments, SAID Toyota's better sales volume "underlines the strength of Toyota, particularly as both Nissan and Honda showed relatively weak results". Japanese No.2 Honda, also known for its fuel-efficient cars, last week booked a 5.2 percent rise in quarterly operating profit, while Nissan rattled markets with a 17 percent drop in quarterly profit and a warning on its full-year profit. Toyota shares rose 24 percent in October-December, beating a 17 percent gain in the Tokyo market's transport sector subindex .ITEQP.T. Honda shares gained 18.4 percent. Toyota closed up 1.8 percent at 7,960 on Tuesday ahead of the results. (Additional reporting by Aya Takada, Yuko Inoue and Noriyuki Hirata) ($1=120.17 Yen)
