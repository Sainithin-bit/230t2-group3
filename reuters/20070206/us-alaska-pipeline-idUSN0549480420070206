 ANCHORAGE, Alaska  (Reuters) - The operator of the Trans Alaska Pipeline System was on the lookout Monday for a piece of a cleaning device -- called a pig -- that mysteriously got dislodged somewhere inside the 800-mile oil pipeline in December. 


 So far, the missing pig part has not affected operations on the 800,000 barrel-per-day pipeline. The device is called a pig because it makes a squealing sound as it travels through the pipeline, scraping debris along the way. "The oil's still flowing," said Curtis Thomas of Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. "There's been no obstruction to the flow of oil," The pipeline is owned by a consortium of oil companies led by BP Plc. ( BP.L ) ( BP.N ) A 20-inch diameter ring fell off the plug-like pig device somewhere in the 800 miles of the pipeline, which is 48 inches in diameter. Both Alyeska and agencies that regulate the pipeline hope to find the missing ring before it does any internal damage, officials said. No damage has yet been detected, officials said. Alyeska was trying to recover the missing ring with a special disc pig, an especially aggressive scraper, that was launched last Friday said Curtis Thomas, a company spokesman. Alyeska runs cleaning pigs through the pipeline every seven to 14 days, Thomas said. It takes about a week for each pig to work its way through the entire 800 miles, he said. If the disc pig does not recover the ring, Alyeska will search for it by sifting through several barrels of wax that were recovered in previous cleaning pig runs, Thomas said. It is highly unusual to lose a piece of a cleaning pig in the line, said Rhea DoBosh, a spokeswoman for the Joint Pipeline Office, the consortium of federal and state agencies that oversee the Trans Alaska Pipeline System. "In the 16 years that I've been working here, this is only the second one," she said. "It's anybody's guess what exactly happened to it." DoBosh said the Joint Pipeline Office believes Alyeska has responded properly to the missing-ring problem. "We haven't asked Alyeska to do anything different at this point. Everything that can be done is being done," she said. A BP unit owns about 47 percent of the pipeline, followed by units of Conoco Phillips ( COP.N ) at about 28 percent, Exxon Mobil Corp. ( XOM.N ) at about 20 percent, privately held Koch Industries at 3 percent and Chevron Corp. ( CVX.N ) at 1 percent.
