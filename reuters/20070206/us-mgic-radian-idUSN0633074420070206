 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Mortgage insurer MGIC Investment ( MTG.N ) plans to buy rival Radian Group Inc. ( RDN.N ) for about $5.47 billion, the companies said on Tuesday, a move that will allow them to cut costs amid shrinking demand that has been hurt further by a slowing housing market. 


 Initially worth about $5 billion, the value of the offer rose as shares of both companies increased in early trading. The housing slowdown has led to a decline in premiums for some mortgage insurers, while tight credit spreads and increased competition from other products have created a difficult operating environment for these companies. Mortgage insurers provide private mortgage insurance for residential first mortgage loans, which enable people to purchase homes with less than a 20 percent down payment. The increased use of "piggyback loans", or second mortgages, has cut into demand for such insurance. MGIC and Radian also provide other mortgage services and products such as credit-related insurance coverage. The combined company expects to realize pretax cost savings of $128 million, 75 percent of them in 2008, MGIC and Radian said in a statement. The deal calls for the exchange of 0.9658 MGIC shares for each Radian share. The deal was valued at $60.77 per share based on Monday's closing price of $62.93 for MGIC. Based on outstanding share count of 82.05 million in Radian's latest regulatory filing, that put the deal total at about $5 billion. That $60.77 was slightly below Radian's closing price of $60.84 on the New York Stock Exchange on Monday. The stock rose $5.15, or 8.5 percent, to $66 in early trading on Tuesday, while MGIC gained $6.11, or 9.7 percent, to $69.04. POST-MERGER PLANS The new company, to be called MGIC Radian Financial Group, will have nearly $15 billion in total assets, with anticipated restructuring costs of $125 million to $150 million before taxes. MGIC and Radian expect to close the deal in the fourth quarter. If the cost cuts occur, MGIC expects the deal to add to earnings by 2.8 percent in 2008 and 6.3 percent in 2009. MGIC Chairman and Chief Executive Curt Culver will lead the new company, while Radian CEO S.A. Ibrahim becomes president and chief operating officer. Ibrahim will succeed Culver as CEO in 2009 and chairman in 2010, the companies said. The board will initially include six directors appointed by MGIC and five by Radian. After the merger, the company will nominate an additional Radian director to be elected by shareholders. Headquarters will be in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where MGIC is based. Goldman Sachs advised MGIC, and Lehman Brothers advised Radian. (Additional reporting by  Caroline Humer )
