 PARIS  (Reuters) - Telecoms equipment provider Alcatel-Lucent ALU.PA could cut up to 20 percent of staff, French weekly l'Expansion reported on Tuesday. 


 However, unions and analysts cast doubts over the report which would mean the cuts would involve 15,000 to 20,000 employees, significantly more than the 9,000 previously announced as part of the merger. Of the jobs to be cut, l'Expansion said 1,500 to 2,000 would be in France. It quoted industrial and union sources saying 500 of these would be through early retirement. Union representatives said they expected to meet with management and could receive the first details regarding the cuts as of next Tuesday. Alcatel declined to comment on the report. Alcatel-Lucent shares were relatively flat at 9.87 euros at 1607 GMT, which analysts said meant the market was not giving much credence to the report. Works councils, union representatives and management are due to meet on February 13, 14 and 16 to discuss the job cuts. "We have not received yet any details on the size of the job cuts," said Alain Hurstel, head of the European works council for Alcatel-Lucent and a member of the CFDT union. "But I don't think these numbers (15,000 to 20,000) are based on reality. If they were, it would mean that the situation was catastrophic." UNIONS MEET ON STRIKE ACTION French unions were meeting on Tuesday afternoon to consider whether to strike over previous speculation of heavy job cuts. Chief Financial Officer Jean-Pascal Beaufret had said in November that the staff cuts would come mainly from redundant positions in sales and support functions which could be shared between the two companies. "The figure is enormous and so is the range (between the estimates). If that were the case it would be an admission that the merger is a failure," said Jean-Baptiste Triquet, a representative at Alcatel of the CFDT union. "Those sorts of job cuts would cause a scandal." On January 23, Alcatel Lucent lost over a tenth of its market value after it warned that uncertainty created by its recent merger would hurt sales and profits. The two companies began operating from December 1 as a combined unit, making it the world's second-largest supplier of telecoms network and mobile equipment after Cisco Systems Inc. ( CSCO.O ). The group is to publish its full 2006 results on Friday. Alcatel-Lucent said last month it expected unadjusted fourth-quarter revenues of about 3.87 billion euros ($5 billion) and fourth-quarter operating income of about 120 million euros. It added it expected asset-impairment charges of around 800 million euros for the fourth quarter. The company said its planned cost savings of at least 600 million euros for 2007 are 200 million euros higher than initially announced. "I think there is a possibility there could be more job cuts than announced but not on that scale (as mentioned in the report)," one London-based analyst said.
