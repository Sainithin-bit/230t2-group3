 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Wm. Wrigley Jr. Co. WWY.N, the world's largest chewing gum maker, posted a 37 percent rise in quarterly profit on Tuesday as improved performance in Germany and strong demand in China offset flat sales in North America. 


 Wrigley also said its board approved a 13 percent increase in its quarterly dividend to 29 cents a share. Shares of Wrigley, whose products include Big Red chewing gum, Life Savers candies and Altoids mints, jumped 4 percent on the heels of the results, before paring some of those gains. Fourth-quarter profit rose to $128.8 million, or 46 cents per share, compared with $94.1 million, or 33 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding restructuring charges, Wrigley earned 51 cents per share, topping analysts' average forecast of 49 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. JP Morgan analyst Pablo Zuanic, who has an "underweight" rating on Wrigley shares, said while the profit topped expectations, the beat was of "low quality." Sales rose 9.9 percent to $1.22 billion, in line with analysts' expectations. Wrigley said sales in Europe and Asia each rose nearly 20 percent on strength in France, Russia, Ukraine, the Middle East, China and Hong Kong. Sales in Germany also improved during the quarter, the company said. Sales in North America were flat as strong gains in sugar-free gum were offset by declines in sugar gum brands. Zuanic said a decline in gross margins also raised concerns. Gross margins rose to 50.4 versus 50.0 percent a year ago, but excluding the impact of restructuring and stock options, they fell to 52.2 percent from 53.1 percent due to some lower-margin products and pressure in some markets. Gross margins remain at "very healthy levels" overall, Chief Financial Officer Reuben Gamoran said in a statement. He said Wrigley should see benefits of its restructuring in 2007, which should help it manage against any more margin pressures. CADBURY STEPS UP, NEW PRODUCTS PLANNED Wrigley shares were up $1.49, or 2.9 percent, at $52.81 on the New York Stock Exchange after rising as high as $53.45. They jumped as much as 16 percent on October 23 when Wrigley named former Nike Inc. ( NKE.N ) Chief Executive William Perez as the first person outside the Wrigley family to run the company. But the stock has edged down as rival Cadbury Schweppes Plc CBRY.L has become more aggressive. Cadbury is introducing its Trident gum in Britain, where Wrigley has 98.4 percent of the market. Wrigley is staying aggressive in the UK, with new products such as a liquid-filled pellet Extra gum and Orbit Complete gum. In other markets, new products include Dark Chocolate Dipped Altoids, Hubba Bubba Sour Gummi Tape and Mojito Mint and Raspberry Mint flavors of Orbit gum in the United States, and a gum touting wellness benefits based on traditional Chinese medicine that will debut in China. Perez said in a statement Wrigley is well positioned in key markets and categories for growth in 2007 and in the future. Wrigley has made several acquisitions in recent years to expand beyond chewing gum. It just bought an 80 percent stake in privately held Russian chocolate maker A. Korkunov, its first foray into the chocolate business after a failed 2002 bid to buy Hershey Co. ( HSY.N ). Wrigley plans to buy the remaining stake of A. Korkunov over time.
