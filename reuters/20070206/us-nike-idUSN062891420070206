 BEAVERTON, Oregon  (Reuters) - Nike Inc.'s ( NKE.N ) President of Global Operations, Gary DeStefano, said on Tuesday that Nike would open 100 stores globally in the next three years, half of them in the United States. 


 DeStefano said the openings would make Nike a better partner to its retailers. Nike's two largest customers, Foot Locker ( FL.N ) and Finish Line ( FINL.O ), have seen sluggish demand in the U.S. recently. "Our primary job is to be a better partner. This is not about Nike versus the retailers," DeStefano said. "This is a partnership. We believe this could be a growth strategy for our industry." Nike said it sees its direct-to-retail business, which includes its stores, outlets and E-commerce division, increasing to 15 percent of total sales within 5 years from 12 percent today. Nike spokesman Alan Marks said that while sales to Nike's retail partners make up 80 percent of the company's total revenue today, that percentage is not expected to change.
