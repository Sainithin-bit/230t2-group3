 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Diversified manufacturer Emerson 
Electric Co. ( EMR.N ) reported higher quarterly profit on 
Tuesday, led by demand in its industrial automation and network 
power segments. 


  Earnings rose 12 percent to $445 million, or 55 cents per 
share in Emerson's fiscal first quarter ended Dec 31, compared 
with $399 million, or 48 cents per share, a year earlier.  Analysts, on average, expected profit of 53 cents per 
share, according to Reuters Estimates.  Revenue rose 11 percent to $5.1 billion, ahead of Wall 
Street forecasts. Of that increase, sales from existing 
businesses rose 4 percent, with the balance coming from 
acquisitions and divestitures and from a weaker U.S. dollar.  Four of Emerson's five segments reported higher quarterly 
sales, with the process management, industrial automation and 
network power segments reporting double-digit revenue gains.  But a weak U.S. residential market dragged down sales and 
profit margins in Emerson's climate technologies segment, which 
makes air conditioners.  St. Louis-based Emerson, whose products range from electric 
motors and tools to storage products and software that makes 
factories run efficiently, said international sales accounted 
for more than half the total for the first time.  Looking ahead, Emerson said in expects full-year earnings 
per share in a range of $2.50 to $2.60, which would represent 
growth of 12 percent to 16 percent. Analysts on average expect 
2007 profit of $2.55 per share.
