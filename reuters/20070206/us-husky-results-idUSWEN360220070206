 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Fourth-quarter profit at Husky Energy Inc. ( HSE.TO ) fell as revenue declined, Canada's No. 4 oil explorer and refiner said on Monday. 


 Husky's net income fell to C$542 million, or C$1.28 a share, from C$669 million, or $1.58 per share, in the year-ago quarter. Sales and operating revenue, net of royalties fell to $3.1 billion from $3.2 billion in the year-ago quarter. Husky said it agreed to dispose of certain noncore assets in western Canada for total proceeds of C$339 million. It said the deal, for properties producing about 5,200 barrels of oil equivalent a day, would close in the first quarter. The company said that production for the fourth quarter was 376,100 barrels of oil equivalent per day compared with 328,500 barrels in the same quarter a year ago. ($1=$1.18 Canadian)
