 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Cisco Systems Inc. said on Tuesday its quarterly net profit rose as customers bought more network equipment in response to growing Internet traffic. 


 Net income for the fiscal second quarter ended January 27 rose to $1.9 billion, or 31 cents per share, from $1.4 billion, or 22 cents per share, in the same quarter a year earlier. Earnings excluding stock-based compensation charges, amortization of intangibles and a tax credit was 33 cents per share, against the average analyst forecast of 31 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. Quarterly net sales rose 27 percent to $8.4 billion from $6.6 billion in the year-ago quarter. That exceeded Cisco's November forecast for revenue growth of 24 percent to 25 percent and Wall Street's consensus forecast for $8.28 billion in revenue, according to Reuters Estimates. Shares of Cisco fell slightly in after-hours trade to $27.07 after closing at $27.28 on Tuesday. Cisco shares surged about 60 percent in 2006 as telecommunications and cable companies upgraded their networks to handle growing demand for Web-based videos, such as those shown on YouTube.com. That increase compared to a 7 percent rise in the Nasdaq 100 and a 15 percent fall in the shares of rival equipment maker Juniper Networks Inc. last year. Erik Suppiger, analyst at Pacific Growth Equities, said Cisco's stock was unlikely to repeat last year's performance. "I'm hardly going to suggest we'll see a repeat of the strength we saw last year," he said. The San Jose, California-based company, the world's largest maker of the routers and switches that direct Internet traffic, has also been expanding into video, as seen in its move last year to acquire cable set-top box maker Scientific-Atlanta. Cisco said Scientific-Atlanta, bought during the third quarter of fiscal 2006, contributed quarterly net sales of $639 million.
