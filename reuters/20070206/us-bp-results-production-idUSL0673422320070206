 LONDON  (Reuters) - Oil giant BP Plc ( BP.L ) said on Tuesday its new production growth goal of 4.0 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) by 2009 represented a substantial scaling back of the company's growth ambitions. 


 "The growth is much lower than we had previously indicated," spokesman Toby Odone said. BP said last year it was aiming for 4 percent growth out to 2010, based on oil prices of $40 per barrel. The new 4 million boepd goal is calculated on the basis of $60 per barrel oil. Odone said the difference meant the 2009 target equated to 4.3 million boepd on the $40 basis, still well below the 4 percent growth target.
