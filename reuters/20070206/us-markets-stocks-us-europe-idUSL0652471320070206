 PARIS  (Reuters) - Shares on Wall Street are expected to open higher on Tuesday, as stronger oil prices are likely to underpin energy stocks and investors bet on strong earnings from network equipment maker Cisco Systems ( CSCO.O ). 


 Cisco will report fiscal second-quarter results after the closing bell. Wall Street is looking for earnings per share to rise more than 19 percent on a revenue gain of nearly 25 percent, according to Reuters Estimates. Other companies due to report on Tuesday include beauty products maker Avon Products ( AVP.N ), power company Duke Energy ( DUK.N ), and diversified manufacturers Emerson Electric ( EMR.N ) and Tyco International ( TYC.N ). By 1100 GMT, U.S. stock futures were pointing to opening gains of between 0.1 percent and 0.3 percent for the three main indexes SPc1 DJc1 NDc1. On Monday, the Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  gained 0.07 percent to end at 12,661.74, while the Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  edged down 0.10 percent to 1,446.99 and the Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  slipped 0.21 percent to 2,470.60. Oil will be in focus again as crude prices bounced back above $59 a barrel on expectations that the coldest weather of the U.S. winter would cut heating oil stocks in the world's top energy consumer. The oil price rise is likely to boost energy stocks, even if a disappointing update from industry giant BP ( BP.L ) slightly weighed on sentiment. BP slashed its growth targets and raised spending plans as it reported better-than-expected, but falling, fourth quarter profits. Ongoing takeover news should lift selected stocks such as Equity Office Properties Trust EOP.N, which said the Blackstone Group BG.UL raised the price of its takeover bid to $55.50 per share, after rival bidder Vornado Realty Trust ( VNO.N ) sweetened its own offer. Click on <ID:nN06336110> CMS Energy Corp. ( CMS.N ) said it agreed to sell its stakes in businesses in the Middle East, Africa and India to the Abu Dhabi National Energy Co. TAQA.AD for $900 million to focus on investments in its Michigan utility. On the economic front, interest rate-wary investors will watch out for Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, Chicago Fed President Michael Moskow, and San Francisco Fed President Janet Yellen, who are all due to speak at separate events. The day's economic agenda includes a report on weekly U.S. chain store sales from the International Council of Shopping Centers (ICSC) at 1245 GMT and a separate weekly chain-store sales report from independent research firm Redbook Research at 1355 GMT, as well as the ABC/Washington Post consumer comfort index at 2200 GMT.
