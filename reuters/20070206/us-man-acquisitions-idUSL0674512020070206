 MUNICH  (Reuters) - German truckmaker MAN AG ( MANG.DE ) said it would patiently wait and see what renewed merger talks with Swedish rival Scania ( SCVb.ST ) would bring, but also aims to examine other possible acquisitions. 


 "We are open to all acquisitions that may come to the market," said Chief Executive Hakan Samuelsson, when asked at a news conference on Tuesday whether MAN might consider a purchase of U.S. partner Navistar International ( NAV.N ). Amid ongoing speculation over either a potential bid for MAN by its large shareholder Volkswagen ( VOWG.DE ) or a counterbid by Scania, MAN's Samuelsson also affirmed that he wanted the company to remain an independently, stock-exchange listed firm. The MAN CEO added that he had no intention to step down from the post so long as he continued to enjoy the support and confidence of the group's board and staff.
