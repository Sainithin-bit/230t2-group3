 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Virginia became the first U.S. state to begin rolling back retail electricity competition as the state legislature approved a bill on Tuesday that would halt its planned market opening. 


 Both bodies of the Virginia General Assembly approved a measure that would end the state's 10-year experiment with partial deregulation at the consumer level. The bill has been supported by the state's main utility, Dominion Resources Inc.. The House approved the measure by a vote of 85-13 and the Senate passed a companion bill with a 37-2 vote, according to the assembly's legislative information Web site. A spokesman for Gov. Tim Kaine said he expected to sign the measure into law, but could make amendments. A wave of deregulation swept across the United States in the 1990s as politicians moved to open electricity markets to competition in a bid to drive down costs. But now states are reassessing retail deregulation in the face of spiking electricity rates and growing consumer complaints. Some Maryland residents saw their bills surge more than 70 percent after it lifted a rate freeze that had been put in place to smooth the transition to a competitive market. Retail competition never took off in Virginia, and currently there are no retail alternatives to Dominion with the exception of a few consumers in northern Virginia who can switch to green power providers, according to a Dominion spokesman. James Halloran, analyst for National City Bank, said Virginia's actions are "the first indication by a state legislature, if you take out California five years ago, that states are realizing that maybe deregulation at the consumer level is not the right model for electricity." California's attempt at partial deregulation ended following a fiasco of rolling black-outs and market manipulation in 2000 and 2001. The Virginia bill would have a regulatory body maintain control of utilities' electric rates. Under the previous plan, market-based rates were scheduled to commence in 2010. Under the bill approved by the legislature, rates will be based on the utility's common return on equity (ROE) for its generation and distribution services. The State Corporation Commission would set ROE levels comparable to those of utilities in the southeastern United States, according Dominion. The bill also advances by two years the termination date of the state's freeze on power rates. The capped rate period would end on December 31, 2008.
