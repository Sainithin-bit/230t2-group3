 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japan's trade minister Yukio Edano said on Monday he told Tokyo Electric Power Co ( 9501.T ) to achieve at least 2.5 trillion yen ($33 billion) in cost cuts over 10 years, the target set by a government panel on Tepco's restructuring in a report earlier this month. 
 Edano made the comment as he met with Tepco President Toshio Nishizawa. (Reporting by Kentaro Hamada; Writing by Osamu Tsukimori; Editing by Edmund Klamann)
