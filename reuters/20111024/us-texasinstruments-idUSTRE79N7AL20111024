 (Reuters) - Texas Instruments TXN.N posted a decline in quarterly revenue and earnings on Monday and said economic uncertainty would continue to hurt its fourth quarter results in almost every major market segment. 
 The maker of chips for wide range of products including cellphones, consumer electronics and industrial equipment, said net income fell to $601 million or 51 cents per share from $859 million or 71 cents per share in the year ago quarter. Revenue fell seven percent to $3.47 billion from $3.74 billion a year ago but was ahead of its forecast range of $3.23 billion to $3.27 billion. TI closed its $6.5 billion purchase of another chip maker National Semiconductor on Sept 23, just before the quarter ended. (Reporting by  Sinead Carew ; editing by Carol Bishopric)
