 NEW ORLEANS/NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Here are some developments in BP Plc's Gulf of Mexico oil spill, the largest in U.S. history. 

 TOP DEVELOPMENTS * BP Plc is in talks with U.S. oil and gas company Apache Corp. and others to sell assets worth up to $10 billion as it grapples with the costs of its spill in the Gulf of Mexico. * BP said it expects to attach a new containment cap later on Monday that should more than triple the amount of oil being collected from the energy giant's leaking Gulf of Mexico wellhead. CAPTURE/CONTAINMENT/CLEANUP * BP would implement a permanent oil-collection system at its Gulf of Mexico leak by late August or early September if a pair of relief wells fail to plug the gusher, a BP executive told the Obama oil spill commission on Monday. * On Monday, the first of two relief wells, begun on May 2, was about 190 feet from intercepting the blown-out well that is 13,000 feet beneath the seabed, Doug Suttles, BP's chief operating officer said. * The siphoning vessel Q4000, collected and burned off 8,235 barrels of leaking oil on Sunday. BP said as of July 10 the total amount of oil collected or flared by its containment systems was about 749,100 barrels. POLITICS/POLICY * The Obama administration is likely to announce revised rules banning deepwater offshore drilling on Monday, an administration official said. The announcement was expected after an original blanket ban was struck down by a federal court. * A White House panel probing the BP Plc oil spill began work on Monday and could offer recommendations on the future of deepwater drilling within six months, one of its co-chairmen said. * The U.S. Justice Department has started interviewing witnesses as part of the criminal and civil investigation of the oil spill, Attorney General Eric Holder said in a television interview broadcast on Sunday. MARKET IMPACT/COMPANIES * Anadarko Petroleum Corp, which owns 25 percent of the ruptured BP well, has told the British energy giant that, for now, it will not pay a $272 million bill to cover cleanup costs. * Diamond Offshore Drilling Inc. is pulling one of its deepwater rigs out of the Gulf of Mexico, in the first such move resulting from uncertainties surrounding the U.S. moratorium on deepwater drilling. * BP said on Monday the cost of the spill had risen to about $3.5 billion. More than 52,000 payments have been made to claimants, totaling almost $165 million. About 105,000 claims had been submitted. * BP shares surged more than 9 percent in London and nearly 8 percent in New York on Monday, driven by the potential asset sales and hopes for a new system to capture almost all of the spewing oil. * BP shares have fallen about 40 percent since an explosion on its Deepwater Horizon rig on April 20, which killed 11 men.
