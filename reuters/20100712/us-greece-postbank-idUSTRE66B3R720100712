 ATHENS  (Reuters) - State-controlled Hellenic Postbank (TT) ( GPSr.AT ), one of six Greek lenders to be stress- tested as part of Europe-wide checks, expects the simulation will show it has enough capital, its vice chairman said on Monday. 

 "TT has a capital adequacy ratio that is the highest in Greece, with Tier 1 at about 17 percent in the first quarter. There is absolutely no expectation of any need for additional capital," Spyros Pantelias told Reuters in an interview. "I am optimistic stress tests will show that other Greek banks are also in good shape, adequately capitalized," he said, declining to go into the specifics of test assumptions and parameters. EU regulators are testing the strength of 91 banks to assess if they can withstand potential losses on their sovereign bond holdings and other shocks. The objective is to reassure investors on the health of European banks as the debt crisis batters Greek, Portuguese and Spanish government paper. The Committee of European Banking Supervisors (CEBS) will be publishing results on July 23. (Reporting by George Georgiopoulos; Editing by David Cowell)
