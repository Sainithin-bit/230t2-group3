 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Diamond Offshore Drilling Inc said on Monday it would move a second deepwater rig out of the Gulf of Mexico due to a U.S. moratorium imposed after a BP Plc oil rig blew up, causing the largest oil spill disaster in U.S. history. 

 The move to waters off the Republic of Congo is with the same customer, Murphy Oil Corp, but the old four-year contract running to March 2012 has been restructured into a one-year Gulf of Mexico commitment set to restart when Murphy feels it can get permits and meet regulatory requirements. The new international contract for the Ocean Confidence is for three wells, plus an option for extra work, and Murphy will handle the costs of mobilizing the rig to and from Congo. The two contracts combined will generate up to $234 million in revenue, Diamond said, without giving further details. The previous contract with Murphy paid Diamond a rate of about $510,000 per day for the Confidence. The rig departed the Gulf of Mexico over the weekend and is expected to arrive off Africa in about 60 days, Diamond said. On Friday, Houston-based Diamond became the first company to pull a rig out of the Gulf of Mexico while blaming the deepwater moratorium, which will run until the end of November.
