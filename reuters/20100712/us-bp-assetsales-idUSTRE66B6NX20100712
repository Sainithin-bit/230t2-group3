 (Reuters) - BP Plc might hit its target for asset disposals all at once in a deal with Apache Corp, according to reports, but it has a variety of oil and gas interests around the world among its $250 billion in total assets that could end up on the block. 

 The British company said last month it wanted to raise $10 billion from sell-offs for a $20 billion fund to clean up the worst oil spill in U.S. history. BP has not yet decided what to sell, according to an executive, but below are what some analysts see as potential disposals. ALASKA Among BP's extensive Alaskan interests that may be partly sold, it operates and owns 26 percent of Prudhoe Bay, the largest oilfield in North America and one of the 20 largest ever discovered. The field has seen production decline, but at 69,000 barrels per day (bpd) in 2009, it still contributed more than a third of BP's total output from Alaska's North Slope. RUSSIA On top of BP's Russian joint venture TNK-BP, the British company also holds a minority stake in Rosneft that many analysts see as a potential disposal. VIETNAM Bankers are looking at the potential sale of BP's stake in the $1.3 billion Nam Con Son gas project offshore of Ho Chi Minh City. COLOMBIA The Cusiana and Cupiagua fields, discovered by BP in the early 1990s, saw production peak in 1999, achieving an average rate of 434,000 bpd. When BP handed over the operation of the Cupiagua field at the start of July to state oil company Ecopetrol SA, while continuing to operate Cusiana, Cupiagua output was running at 26,000 bpd. VENEZUELA BP has minority stakes in two exploration and production joint ventures with state-owned PDVSA, and is a partner in the Petromonagas crude upgrader that produces 110,000 bpd, with gross reserves of 1.2 billion barrels of oil equivalent (boe). ARGENTINA BP has 60 percent of Pan American Energy (PAE), and Bridas Corp holds the rest. Cerro Dragon, one of the largest shallow oil and gas fields in southern Argentina that was once deemed near the end of its life, now sets new output records, at about 80,000 bpd of oil -- 80 percent of PAE output -- and 130 million cubic feet of gas a day. Reserves are 1 billion boe. (Reporting by  Braden Reddall , editing by Matthew Lewis)
