 LONDON  (Reuters) - Shares in BP extended gains on Monday, up over 9 percent, reaching 400 pence for the first time in more than a month, buoyed by news that it is very close to capping the well. 

 The share is on track for its best performance since November 2008 and powered gains in the wider market, but it is still 40 percent below its value before the leak in the Gulf of Mexico started in April. "There's lots of short covering going on, most brokers are assigning it a "buy," and technically charts were signaling a buy," said Nick Batsford, managing director at hedge fund Bos Asset Management.
