 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The Justice Department said on Monday it will ask U.S. courts to toss out the case against its original deepwater drilling moratorium because a new suspension order was issued earlier on Monday to address drilling in the wake of the BP Plc spill. 

 The Obama administration will ask the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit to vacate the injunction blocking the original moratorium and ask the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana, which granted the injunction, to dismiss the case as well. The district court granted an injunction blocking the May moratorium order and the appeals court refused the administration's request to lift that injunction because it failed to show that drillers were about to begin work again.
