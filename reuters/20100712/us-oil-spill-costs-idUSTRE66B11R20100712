 LONDON  (Reuters) - BP Plc, which is making progress with a new containment system for its ruptured well in the Gulf of Mexico, said on Monday the cost of the spill had risen to about $3.5 billion. 

 It also said more than 52,000 payments have been made to claimants, totaling almost $165 million. About 105,000 claims had been submitted, it added. BP said as of July 10 the total amount of oil collected or flared by its containment systems was about 749,100 barrels. It also repeated details about work on a new system that is due to capture almost all the oil spewing from the blown-out well. (Reporting by  Eric Onstad ; Editing by  David Holmes )
