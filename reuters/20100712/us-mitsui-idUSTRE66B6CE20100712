 (Reuters) - A unit of Japanese trading house Mitsui & Co Ltd has decided not to comply with a request from BP Plc to contribute to the oil-spill clean-up costs in the Gulf of Mexico, the Nikkei business daily said. 

 BP had asked for $111 million from Mitsui Oil Exploration Co, which owns 10 percent of the blown-out seabed well, the newspaper said. The deadline for the payment was Monday, the daily said. Mitsui's stock has lost more than one-fifth of its market value, or around $7 billion, since the spill occurred on April 20. BP, which is making progress with a new containment system for the ruptured well, said on Monday the cost of the spill had risen to about $3.5 billion. It also said more than 52,000 payments have been made to claimants, totaling almost $165 million. (Reporting by  Krishna N. Das  in Bangalore; Editing by Unnikrishnan Nair)
