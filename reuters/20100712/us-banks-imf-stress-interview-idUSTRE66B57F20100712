 BEIRUT  (Reuters) - European governments should step in if stress tests show there are viable banks that need capital but are unable to come up with their own plans to raise funds, an International Monetary Fund official said on Monday. 

 EU regulators are to conduct stress tests on 91 major banks -- or 65 percent of the European banking sector -- against an agreed set of criteria including sovereign risk, and they will publish the results on July 23. Regulators are aiming to restore trust among bank investors, in the same way that U.S. stress tests last year helped draw a line under the problems there. "If the banks' tests find that there are some banks which have less capital than what is needed to pass the test then these banks should be given some time to solve themselves the problems to raise the capital which is needed," said Jose Vinals, the IMF's financial counselor and director of the monetary and capital markets department. Failing the test would imply a bank needs more capital to preserve its core capital ratios under the test scenario. "Only in those cases where the banks are unable to come up with viable plans to recapitalize themselves, then the national authorities should put in place the means to help these banks recapitalize," he told Reuters on the sidelines of a seminar in Beirut. Vinals said the European authorities' intervention should be carried out in a way that is consistent with a minimum amount of public resources being used, "but with the maximum effectiveness in order to bring these banks into a proper situation." Banks not considered viable, however, may be better off going to the wall. "There may be some banks who do not pass the stress test that will have (to be) liquidated and resolved," he said. "We will have to wait until the stress results are announced in order to find out which banks, if any, are in need of more capital," he said. GLOBAL REGULATORY REFORM Vinals said that as part of the current global wave of regulatory reform there will be a minimum safety standard for the level of capital that banks should have in any country. The EU has pledged to set up a new framework to supervise banks, insurers and markets in line with global efforts spearheaded by the G20 group of leading countries to apply lessons from the financial crisis, such as more coordinated scrutiny. Minimum safety standards would mean banks will have to have higher and better-quality capital, Vinals said. Asked how banks should increase capital, he said: "Some will have to merge, consolidate. Some don't have to do that, they will have to raise capital in the market. So it will be seen depending on which country what is the right strategy." "We are in the process of trying to verify what is the impact of the different possibilities concerning how high capital should be to try to strike the right balance between safety and efficiency." The G20 plans to finalize an overhaul of bank capital and liquidity rules by November this year and is aiming to have banks implement them by the end of 2012. (Editing by  Hugh Lawson )
