 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - The following are comments by euro zone finance ministers and other officials meeting in Brussels on Monday. 

 DUTCH FINANCE MINISTER JAN KEES DE JAGER: On bank stress tests: "When we have those results, we will be committed in Europe to taking determined action if needed at the moment the stress tests are published. "If in any case action is needed, Europe is committed to taking action immediately." On stability pact reform, economic governance: "I think differences are narrowing, especially on general regulation of the Stability and Growth Pact. But my concern is how to enforce it." POLISH FINANCE MINISTER JACEK ROSTOWSKI "I think there will be an agreement on the issue of the European semester." AUSTRIAN FINANCE MINISTER JOSEF PROELL On stress tests: "I am firmly convinced that it is now necessary to conduct these stress tests. I am eager to learn the results at the end of July. Asked if Austria might need to draw on the EFSF: "We have enough room for maneuver if it were necessary. However, we do not see the necessity." On Slovakia: "I am very optimistic that the new Slovak finance minister recognizes the seriousness of the situation and a signature will be given in the next hours or days. And then the vehicle will be fully operational." SLOVAKIAN FINANCE MINISTER IVAN MIKLOS Asked whether Slovakia would sign the framework agreement on EU aid mechanism EFSF, Miklos said: "Not today. I am not here for the signing, I am here for discussing and negotiating. But we will decide soon, as soon as possible." GERMAN FINANCE MINISTER WOLFGANG SCHAEUBLE On banking stress tests: "First it is said they are much too strict, that this is killing the banks. The next day it is said they are to weak and have no effect. The truth is mostly in the middle." "I think the decision to extend the stress-test scenarios and to publish the results...is an important step to end insecurity on the markets about the situation of the banks in Europe. That is the objective of the exercise. I hope we achieve that." On Slovakia's commitment to the aid framework mechanism: "We will push Slovakia like everybody else. The solidarity in the euro zone is the solidarity of everybody for everyone. Nobody should exclude himself." "After elections ... one needs a bit of time." "I don't think that there is any room for negotiation because the SPV is operational and it would send the wrong signal to the markets." EUROGROUP CHAIRMAN JEAN-CLAUDE JUNCKER On Slovakia: "I do think that Slovakia will sign up before mid-July. The instrument (EFSF) will be available without any doubt before the end of the month." BELGIAN FINANCE MINISTER DIDIER REYNDERS On banking stress tests: "We will discuss it (stress tests) at the Ecofin (meeting of European Union finance ministers) tomorrow. Then we will go to publication and we will take the necessary measures."
