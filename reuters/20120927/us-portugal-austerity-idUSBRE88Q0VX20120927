 LISBON  (Reuters) - Portugal needs to maintain its determination to meet the terms of a 78-billion-euro bailout in order to ensure it retains the confidence of its creditors, Prime Minister Pedro Passos Coelho said on Thursday. 
 "Externally, there appears to be and there has been a perception (of the country) that has helped our development," Passos Coelho told a conference. He added that if Portugal drops its determination to meet the bailout goals and "our willingness is not the same, it will be difficult for those abroad to maintain a good impression and want to continue to help us more."
