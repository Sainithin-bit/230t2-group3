 (Reuters) - US Airways ( LCC.N ) said its flight attendants have rejected a tentative contract. 
 The Association of Flight Attendants (AFA) voted 51 percent against ratifying the proposed five-year agreement that would have amended existing contracts for 6800 flight attendants. Shares of US Airlines were flat at $10.44 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. (Reporting by Tej Sapru in Bangalore; Editing by Don Sebastian)
