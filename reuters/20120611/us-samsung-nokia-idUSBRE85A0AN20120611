 HELSINKI  (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics ( 005930.KS ) denied it was interested in acquiring Nokia ( NOK1V.HE ), sending shares in the Finnish mobile phone company down 2 percent. 
 Nokia shares rose 6 percent last Friday on speculation of a possible buyout offer. "Such reports are purely speculative and are not true," the company said. (Reporting by  Ritsuko Ando )
