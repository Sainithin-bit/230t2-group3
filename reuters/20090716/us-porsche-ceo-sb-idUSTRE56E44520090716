 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Porsche SE's ( PSHG_p.DE ) embattled chief executive, Wendelin Wiedeking, is leaving the company, Germany's business weekly WirtschaftsWoche reported on Wednesday, without citing sources. 

 According to the magazine, a successor will be decided on shortly. Until then, an interim executive should be found that has had management experience at both Porsche and its majority controlled subsidiary, Volkswagen ( VOWG.DE ).
