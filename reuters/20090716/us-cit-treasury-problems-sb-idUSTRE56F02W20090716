 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury and other federal agencies explored several aid solutions to rescue CIT Group Inc from collapse, but the liquidity situation of the small-business lender had deteriorated to the point where these became unworkable, a Treasury official said on Wednesday. 

 The official told Reuters that a bankruptcy filing was not a foregone conclusion for CITand other restructuring options may be considered, but the Treasury believes a failure of the firm would not be devastating to markets and smaller companies. (Reporting by  David Lawder ; Editing by  Gary Hill )
