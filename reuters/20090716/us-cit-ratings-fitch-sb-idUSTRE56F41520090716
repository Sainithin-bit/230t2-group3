 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Fitch Ratings on Thursday said that a bankruptcy filing by CIT Group Inc in the near-term is highly probable after the lender failed to secure government support. 

 "Fitch believes there is a high probability that the end result of this review will be that CIT will have to file for bankruptcy protection in the very near term," the agency said in a statement. Fitch downgraded CIT to C from double-B minus and said that a default appears "imminent or inevitable." CIT lends to small- and medium-sized businesses, and has about $40 billion in long-term debt. The company's 5 percent notes due 2014 fell to 52 cents on the dollar early Thursday from 61.5 cents late Wednesday, according to MarketAxess. The cost of insuring its debt against potential default surged. Credit default swaps widened to about 47 percent as an upfront cost, from 34 percent late Wednesday, according to Phoenix Partners data. (Reporting by  Tom Ryan ; Editing by Theodore d'Afflisio)
