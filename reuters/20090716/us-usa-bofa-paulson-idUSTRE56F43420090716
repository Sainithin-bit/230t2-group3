 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Former U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson on Thursday said that he had no grounds to believe the law had been broken by Bank of America when it took over investment bank Merrill Lynch last year. 

 "I have certainly not seen evidence of any illegal actions," Paulson told a House of Representatives Oversight subcommittee in response to a question during a hearing on the takeover, in the heat of last year's financial crisis. (Reporting by  Alister Bull ; Editing by Theodore d'Afflisio)
