 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - PNC Financial Services Group Inc ( PNC.N ), a large U.S. regional bank, said on Wednesday it expects to report earnings of 60 cents to 75 cents a share and adjusted EPS of between $1.00 and $1.15 for the fourth quarter. 

 The changes reflect a write-down of $1.5 billion in commercial mortgage loans, weak trading results amid unprecedented market volatility and a higher provision for credit losses stemming from residential real estate development. PNC also cited an increase in certain BlackRock Inc ( BLK.N ) obligations due to a sharp rise in the price of BlackRock stock. Analysts, on average, had expected PNC to report earnings of $1.33 a share, before items. (Reporting by  Joseph A. Giannone ; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe)
