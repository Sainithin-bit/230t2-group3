 JOHANNESBURG  (Reuters) - Mining group BHP Billiton ( BHP.AX ) ( BLT.L ) temporarily shut down operations on Wednesday at its Olympic Dam uranium and copper mine in Australia after a fatal accident, the firm said. 

 The mine has the world's largest uranium deposit and the fourth biggest copper deposit. "Operations at Olympic Dam have been suspended and employees at site are being briefed and counseled on this tragic incident," a statement said. The mine, located 560 km north of Adelaide, also produces gold and silver. BHP -- the world's third largest copper producer and one of the top five miners of uranium -- said the accident occurred early Wednesday afternoon during maintenance work at the smelter when a worker was struck by a falling object. During the quarter to end September, the operation produced 33,600 tons of copper cathode, 933,000 tons of uranium oxide concentrate, 17,119 ounces of refined gold and 193,000 ounces of refined silver, (Reporting by  Eric Onstad ; editing by Michael Roddy)
