 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Wachovia Corp WB.N Chief Executive Ken Thompson said on Wednesday he is "comfortable" that his bank will "grow earnings" in 2008, but gave no specific forecast. 

 Speaking at a Goldman Sachs conference in New York, Thompson said he was confident that the bank's dividend was secure and he could build reserves and improve the bank's capital ratio although the credit crunch was likely to continue. (Reporting by Ed Leefeldt, editing by Gerald E. McCormick)
