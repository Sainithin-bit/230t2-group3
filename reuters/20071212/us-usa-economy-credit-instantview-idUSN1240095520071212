 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Major central banks on Wednesday said they were banding together to address severe strains in global money markets. 

 Stocks in Europe and the United States surged on the news, while government bonds in both regions dropped sharply. The S&P 500 index was up nearly 1.7 percent in early U.S. trading. The FTSEurofirst 300 index was up more than 0.5 percent. Money market interest rates, which have been elevated for weeks on reluctance among commercial banks to lend to eachother, fell sharply in initial response to the news.  KEY POINTS: * Under the program, the U.S. Federal Reserve will auction short-term funds to depository institutions against a wide variety of collateral that can be used to secure discount window loans. * The program also includes establishment of foreign exchange swap lines with the European Central Bank and the Swiss National Bank. * The first auction under the program will be $20 billion in 28-day term funds on Monday, settling December 20, with a second auction of $20 billion in 35-day funds scheduled for December 20, settling on December 27. Subsequent auctions are scheduled on January 14 and 28.  * COMMENTS: BERNARD CONNOLLY, GLOBAL STRATEGIST, BANQUE AIG, LONDON: "This is a fairly big deal. What seems to me to be happening is twofold. All the central banks accept that there are short-term funding problems. Many of them are reluctant to address that by reducing the policy rate. The fed has been disappointed by the degree of borrowing at the discount window. They're trying to find ways of widening the collateral against which they will lend. By calling it a term auction they're hoping there'll be less stigma attached to it." GEORGE DAVIS, CHIEF TECHNICAL STRATEGIST RBC CAPITAL  MARKETS, TORONTO: "I think most people in the market were expecting the Fed to introduce some new measures to help provide liquidity to the market. That was emphasized yesterday afternoon in terms of the negative (market) reaction to the FOMC rate cut but with no other provisions being introduced at that time." "There were some rumors floating around the market overnight that the Fed was going to introduce some new measures over next couple of days but certainly I think nobody was really expecting this to include the other central banks, in terms of how this mechanism was going to work. most people were looking for perhaps new instruments to be used as collateral, or an extension of the loan window in terms of duration but certainly nobody was expecting this type of global collaboration by the central banks. I think that has caught the market a little bit off guard. "I think to a certain extent the fact that we've got this access, these additional measures whereby people can access liquidity. I think that'd be viewed as a positive by the market and in that sense, perhaps the Fed and other global central banks may not have to be as aggressive with their rate cutting strategies." IAN SHEPHERDSON, CHIEF U.S. ECONOMIST, HIGH FREQUENCY  ECONOMICS, VALHALLA, NEW YORK: "Clearly, the Fed is feeling its way in the dark here; current conditions are unprecedented in modern times. We think these measures are a step in the right direction, but there is simply no way to know for sure how effective they will be. The big question, though, is why the Fed did not make this announcement yesterday, instead of allowing the markets to be hugely disappointed by their actions. Much of the pain yesterday could have been avoided if the Fed had simply said that it would make an announcement about market conditions today. A hint would not have hurt. The bottom line, we think, is that these actions are sensible, but they will not stop the economy slowing in the near-term." KORNELIUS PURPS, FIXED INCOME STRATEGIST AT UNICREDIT,  MUNICH: "This is a measure the markets have been waiting for since August or September and we had already given up hope. The problem was that banks needed funds in foreign currencies and that had become increasingly difficult because interbank markets were blocked. Now we finally have FX swaps, which makes it possible for European commercial banks to get hold of dollars on a short-term basis. It's a measure that helps above all. Time will tell if it's enough." MARTIN SLANEY, HEAD OF DERIVATIVES, GFT GLOBAL MARKETS,  LONDON: "This has come as a massive shot in the arm for the world's equity markets. This appears to be a multilateral agreement by the world's leading central banks to ease future interbank liquidity difficulties. "The provision of a cash injection facility was the stimulus that many investors were waiting for before stepping back into the market. "This is a real rabbit from the hat from the Federal Reserve, and explains their reluctance to cut rates by more than a quarter of a point at their meeting on Tuesday. T.J. MARTA, FIXED-INCOME STRATEGIST, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS,  NEW YORK: "The problem with the discount window is the stigma attached to utilizing it. No institution wants to be seen as potentially having funding issues. The problem with the open market operations is that the liquidity the Fed injects to the money center banks is not traveling throughout the financial system, as banks don't trust each other enough to lend or are so ravenous for liquidity themselves that they won't lend. An auction process appears to address both those issues." BEN BENNETT, CREDIT STRATEGIST, LEHMAN BROTHERS, LONDON: "It sounds good but it depends on what collateral is being allowed and other details we need to see. This sort of action was needed by the market, in terms of something large and co-ordinated. In terms of what happened with the Fed funds or discount rate yesterday, this is more important for the current liquidity crisis in the banking sector. "Even if they had cut rates by more yesterday, it wouldn't have solved the liquidity crisis so this seems like a more targeted approach to that specific problem." STEWART ROBERTSON, EUROPEAN ECONOMIST, MORLEY FUND  MANAGEMENT, LONDON: "There is a clear indication of two things. One is central bank action, giving the lie that they are sitting aloof. Second, (it is) coordinated central bank action. They are not doing things in isolation." SARAH HEWIN, SENIOR ECONOMIST AT AMERICAN EXPRESS BANK,  LONDON: "It's the number one concern at the moment. The Fed eased yesterday, the Bank of England did last week and interbank rates have remained high. Central banks are really looking for ways to increase liquidity, having the experience that cutting policy rates is not doing enough." PETER DIXON, UK ECONOMIST AT COMMERZBANK, LONDON: "The idea is obviously being mooted for sometime. Obviously with spread widening, with year-end liquidity clearly very much in the market and given what has happened yesterday following the Fed's decision, there is always a case that the market doesn't seem to be believing what the central banks are telling them. That's either because the market is right or the central banks are wrong, or the other way round. My guess is that the market is overdoing with its pessimism. Obviously central banks have been forced to step in to take action."
