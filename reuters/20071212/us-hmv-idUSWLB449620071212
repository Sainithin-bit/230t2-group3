 LONDON  (Reuters) - British music and books retailer HMV Group Plc HMV.L said on Wednesday it was well set up for the key Christmas trading period as it unveiled an expected first-half loss. 

 The retailer, which runs Waterstone's bookstores as well as music shops under its own name, said in a statement pretax loss before exceptional items was 28.7 million pounds ($58.75 million) in the six months to October 27. versus a 29.2 million loss last year. According to a Reuters poll of six analysts, the company had been expected to report on average a loss of about 27.2 million pounds, with forecasts ranging from 24 million to 30.9 million. "At this stage, the most important days and weeks of our financial calendar are still ahead of us, and our stores and websites are very well prepared for Christmas," Chief Executive Simon Fox said in a statement. "The group's first half was driven in particular by like for like sales growth in HMV UK & Ireland, where we are successfully exploiting the high growth games and technology categories and increasing our share of music and DVD," Fox added. Total group like-for-like sales grew 5 percent in the first six months, including growth of 9.2 percent at HMV UK and Ireland and 1.4 percent at Waterstone's. The company proposed an unchanged interim dividend of 1.8 pence. Shares in HMV, which have outperformed the UK general retailers' index .FTASX5370 by around 6 percent so far this year, closed at 117 pence on Tuesday, valuing the company at around 454 million pounds.
