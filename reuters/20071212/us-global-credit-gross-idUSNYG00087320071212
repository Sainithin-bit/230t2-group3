 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The manager of the world's biggest bond fund, Bill Gross, said on Wednesday there is less doubt about the Federal Reserve's understanding of the global liquidity crunch after it and other central banks unveiled a plan to bolster credit availability. 

 "There is less doubt today than yesterday that the Fed understands the illiquidity problem in the credit markets," Gross, who is chief investment officer of Pimco or Pacific Investment Management Company told CNBC television that central banks' liquidity program, which will start on Monday, is a big step toward bringing down the interest rates on U.S. 30-year mortgages. "It is important to understand however," Gross said, "that this is a reinsurance policy on liquidity and not risky assets." Gross said he expected the Fed to continue cutting its fed funds target rate, the key U.S. overnight lending rate. Referring to the near term economic impact of central banks' new liquidity measures, Gross said, "I don't think it changes the near term outlook for the economy."
