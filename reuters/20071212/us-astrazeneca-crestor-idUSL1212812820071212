 LONDON  (Reuters) - AstraZeneca Plc ( AZN.L ) said on Wednesday it had filed patent infringement actions in the United States against seven generic drugmakers, which have submitted plans to sell generic versions of its cholesterol pill Crestor. 

 Britain's second-biggest drugs group first announced last month it faced a generic challenge from Cobalt Pharmaceuticals. Since then it has received similar patent challenges from eight additional generic drug manufacturers. All of them plan to market a cheap generic form of AstraZeneca's blockbuster drug Crestor in the key U.S. market before patents protecting the medicine expire. Crestor, which had worldwide sales of $691 million in the third quarter, is covered by three key patents valid until 2016, 2020 and 2021. But the generic firms claim they have either found a way not to infringe these patent or else that the patents are invalid or unenforceable. AstraZeneca said challenges had come from Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd TEVA.O, Aurobindo Pharma Ltd ( ARBN.BO ), Apotex Inc, Par Pharmaceutical Cos Inc PRX.N, Novartis AG's ( NOVN.VX ) Sandoz, Mylan Inc MYL.N, Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Ltd ( GLEN.BO ), and Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd ( SUN.BO ). AstraZeneca has filed individual patent infringement actions in the U.S. District Court, District of Delaware, against Aurobindo, Apotex, Cobalt, Par, Sandoz, Mylan and Sun alleging infringement of patent number 37,314. AstraZeneca originally licensed Crestor from Japan's Shionogi & Co Ltd ( 4507.T ), which receives royalties on sales. (Reporting by  Ben Hirschler )
