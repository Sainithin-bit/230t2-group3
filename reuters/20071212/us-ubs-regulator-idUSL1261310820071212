 ZURICH  (Reuters) - Swiss authorities pressed UBS ( UBSN.VX ) and Credit Suisse ( CSGN.VX ) in September to increase reserve capital levels in case of shock losses, well ahead of UBS' emergency capital hike on Monday, according to a newspaper report on Wednesday. 

 The Swiss Federal Banking Authority (EBK) told both banks that new global capital safety rules known as Basel II would require them to increase emergency capital set aside in case of surprise shocks, EBK chief Daniel Zuberbuehler told Swiss newspaper Finanz und Wirtschaft in an interview. "We told both major banks already in September that, with a view to the supervisory procedures in Basel II, we would demand a higher capital buffer, above regulatory minimums, due to their systemic importance and due to the risks of new business models in investment banking," he was quoted as saying. "They have accepted this fundamentally and we are discussing details with them. A further intensification is not planned," Zuberbuehler said. On Tuesday, investors forced UBS to defend a massive capital injection after some analysts said the bank may be raising more cash than needed. On Monday, UBS unveiled $10 billion of writedowns on subprime mortgage exposures and a capital injection from the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation and an unnamed Middle East investor to bolster its balance sheet -- a dramatic move that followed weeks of uncertainty about its intentions. Zuberbuehler said Credit Suisse -- which has not suffered the same woes as its rival -- had already revealed adequate information about its exposure to credit market turmoil with the banks' third quarter results statement.
