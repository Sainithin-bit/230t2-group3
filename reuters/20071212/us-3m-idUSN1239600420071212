 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - 3M Co ( MMM.N ), the maker of such products as Scotch tape and optical films for liquid crystal displays, said on Wednesday it expects double-digit sales and earnings growth in 2008 and forecast profit slightly above the average Wall Street estimate. 

 The company expects its growth to come from international markets and the weaker dollar. It expects moderately softer world economic growth next year, with the United States continuing to be slow but still growing. The second half of the year is likely to be stronger than the first, and it forecast strong and sustainable growth in developing economies like Brazil, Russia, India and China, the company said. The diversified manufacturer, which also makes Post-It notes and Thinsulate insulation, expects no relief in the U.S. residential housing market. Shares rose as much as nearly 5 percent on a day in which the markets were broadly higher after the U.S. Federal Reserve said it would coordinate with the European Central Bank to ease the global credit crunch. 3M expects 2008 earnings of $5.44 to $5.47 per share. Analysts' average estimate is $5.42, according to Reuters Estimates. It provided the forecast in presentation materials ahead of a meeting with analysts on Wednesday. The St. Paul, Minnesota-based company said it expects sales from existing businesses to grow by 5 percent to 8 percent next year, while acquisitions will contribute about 3 percent to revenue growth. It said current exchange rates suggest the weak U.S. dollar will add up to 3 percent to sales growth. "We're accelerating international growth, and it's enhanced by foreign exchange. Right now foreign exchange is our friend," CEO George Buckley said. Almost two-thirds of its sales next year will be generated overseas, he added. The company has stopped providing quarterly earnings guidance because of high volatility quarter-to-quarter in demand for many of its products, Buckley told analysts and investors. Separately, the CEO said the company would continue to add "tuck-in" acquisitions and would make large acquisitions "from time to time," like its recent Aearo deal. In November, 3M said it would acquire Aearo Technologies, a maker of hearing and eye-protection and energy-absorbing products for $1.2 billion in a move to boost its safety, security and protection products, which currently account for about $3 billion in annual sales. That deal is not expected to close until the first quarter of 2008. "You should view that as an exception rather than the rule," Buckley said. Shares of 3M, a component of the Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI , jumped $2.72 or 3.2 percent to $87.37 in early trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
