 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Moody's' Investors Service on Wednesday changed its outlook on Bank of America Corp ( BAC.N ) to negative from stable following the bank's statement that it expects substantially weaker earnings for the fourth quarter. 

 A negative outlook indicates a rating cut is likely over the next 12 to 18 months. Moody's rates Bank of America's senior debt at "Aa1," the second highest investment grade. Bank of America said on Wednesday it expects its fourth-quarter results to be disappointing due to write-downs and lower trading revenue.  "The negative outlook reflects Bank of America's reduced financial flexibility, as a result of increased credit costs and market-driven losses at a time when Bank of America's tangible capital ratios are low and its dividend rate relatively high," Moody's said in a statement.
