 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japanese electronics maker Sharp Corp ( 6753.T ) said on Wednesday it is suing Samsung Electronics Co Ltd ( 005930.KS ) because the Korean firm's liquid crystal display (LCD) modules and LCD TVs infringe on its patents. 

 It is the latest in a series of legal tussles among Asian technology companies as they increasingly focus on intellectual property to survive fierce competition. Sharp, the world's third-largest LCD TV maker behind Samsung and Sony Corp ( 6758.T ), said it has asked Seoul Central District Court to award it compensatory damages and prohibit the production and sale in South Korea of the products concerned. Samsung officials were not immediately available for comment. The three patents named in the suit relate to brightness, response speeds and viewing angles of LCD panels, Sharp said. Besides its own panel and TV operations, Samsung runs an LCD panel joint venture, called S-LCD, with Sony. A Sharp spokesman said S-LCD products are outside the scope of the lawsuit. The Osaka-based company filed another LCD patent infringement suit in the United States in August against Samsung and its subsidiaries. Global LCD TV sales rose 48 percent from a year earlier to $17.5 billion in July-September, according to research firm DisplaySearch, but many LCD TV suppliers are struggling to generate profits due to sharp price declines. Prior to the announcement, shares in Sharp closed down 0.3 percent at 1,959 yen, largely in line with the Tokyo stock market's electrical machinery index .IELEC.T.
