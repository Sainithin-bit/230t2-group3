 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve's plan to act with other central banks to boost money market liquidity has been in the works for a while and should help reduce some of the stigma associated with bank borrowings from the Fed's discount window, a senior Fed official said on Wednesday. 

 In a press conference call, the U.S. central bank official said the new term auction facility was seen as a more effective way to inject liquidity into the banking system than reducing the discount rate, adding: "This is not about particular financial institutions with particular problems. It is about market functioning." (Reporting by  David Lawder ; Editing by  James Dalgleish )
