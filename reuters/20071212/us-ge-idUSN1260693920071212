 BOSTON  (Reuters) - Investors viewed General Electric Co's ( GE.N ) lower-than-expected 2008 profit guidance as a beat-able number and took heart in its plans to trim its consumer financial services business, sending its shares higher on Wednesday. 

 "There is clearly some dry powder in FY08 guidance," Deutsche Bank analyst Nigel Coe wrote in a note to clients. "Our conclusion is that $2.42 should be viewed as a floor on earnings in the absence of a deep recession next year." GE shares rose 49 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $37.52 on the New York Stock Exchange, on a day when U.S. stock markets were gaining broadly on investor relief that the U.S. Federal Reserve was collaborating with four other central banks to ease credit strains. The second-largest U.S. company by market capitalization on Tuesday said it expected profit to rise at least 10 percent next year to $2.42 per share, stressing that was easily achievable but not providing a possible high-end number. Analysts had looked for 2008 profit of $2.49 per share prior to GE's revised forecast. The Fairfield, Connecticut-based company said its infrastructure arm, which makes jet engines, wind turbines and other heavy equipment, would provide most of its growth next year, helped by strong demand from overseas. With Wednesday's gains, GE shares are up less than 1 percent for the year, trailing both the broad Standard & Poor's 500 index  .SPX  and the Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI . GE trades at 14.8 times forecast 2008 earnings, a slight premium to the forward price-to-earnings ratio of 14.3 for the Dow and 14.5 for the S&P 500. "Given that they're expected to grow their earnings two times S&P in 2008, but they trade at the same valuation, we think eventually they're going to be rewarded for the way that they're managing their earnings growth," said Perry Adams, vice president and senior portfolio manager at Huntington Private Financial Group, which manages $4 billion in assets and counts GE among its holdings. GE is one of a series of U.S. industrial heavyweights spelling out 2008 financial expectations to Wall Street this week. 3M Co ( MMM.N ) on Wednesday said it expects a double-digit rise in profit next year. Honeywell International Inc ( HON.N ) and United Technologies Corp ( UTX.N ) are due to provide their forecasts on Thursday. Due to the size and variety of their operations, these companies are regarded as economic bellwethers. CHANGES POSSIBLE AT GE MONEY GE also said it would look to trim its GE Money consumer finance arms, including considering exiting some private label credit-card businesses, possibly selling off $30 billion to $50 billion of assets. "Shrinking importance of financial services, with the re-emergence of GE's industrial businesses as the key drivers of the portfolio, is a big positive longer term," J.P. Morgan analyst Stephen Tusa wrote in a note to clients. Investors had become particularly jittery about GE Money, the company's consumer-finance arm, after it laid off hundreds of people at its WMC Mortgage subprime-lending unit and subsequently put the unit on the block. "These plans for portfolio streamlining and no new negative surprises at GE Capital was welcome news for investors," Goldman Sachs analyst Deane Dray wrote in a note to clients." In an appearance on CNBC business television on Wednesday, a unit of the diversified conglomerate, GE Chairman and Chief Executive Jeff Immelt said GE's commercial finance arm will likely capitalize on the turbulence roiling markets. He said distressed funding deals can produce returns of up to 30 percent. Immelt said the U.S. consumer will have a tough year in 2008 as mortgage defaults escalate and housing prices fall. But with near full employment rates, Immelt said the U.S. economy does not necessarily have to slow down.
