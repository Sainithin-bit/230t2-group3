 SYDNEY  (Reuters) - Global miner BHP Billiton Plc/Ltd ( BHP.AX )( BLT.L ) said on Wednesday that the market had reacted favorably to its proposed offer for Rio Tinto Plc/Ltd ( RIO.AX )( RIO.L ) and called on Rio to engage in talks. 

 "It's a little mystifying to us that we are unable to talk about a transaction," BHP Chief Executive Marius Kloppers said at an analyst briefing. Kloppers also said BHP had not yet made a submission on its proposed bid to Britain's Takeover Panel. (Reporting by  James Regan )
