 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Central banks have gambled big on whether they can solve the credit crisis by clubbing together to revive bank lending. 

 If their efforts to boost liquidity succeed, the financial market upheaval can be relegated to history as a painful but brief episode. If they fail, the U.S. economy looks headed for recession, dragging much of the world down with it. "This medicine was designed specifically to go after the economy's core ailment, which is the growing scarcity of lending capital by banks," Bernard Baumohl, managing director of the Economic Outlook Group, wrote in a note to clients. "What this coordinated central bank action has done is reduce the (chances) of a recession from 65 percent to 50 percent in the U.S.," he said.. "A lot more still needs to be done to keep the economy out of any real trouble, both in terms of further interest rate cuts and even more creative strategies to facilitate bank lending. We're not out of the woods yet." By teaming up on Wednesday to announce efforts to ease financial market strain, the U.S. Federal Reserve, European Central Bank, Swiss National Bank, Bank of Canada and Bank of England sent a clear signal to investors that they grasped the magnitude of the credit market distress and were prepared to act.  It will not be a quick fix, however, as banks need time to rebuild battered balance sheets and regain confidence in sound lending practices. And it may be too little, too late to undo the damage already done to the world economy. MILD OR SEVERE DOWNTURN? There is little doubt that global economic growth will slow next year, dragged down primarily by weakness in the United States. The International Monetary Fund cut its 2008 global growth forecast to 4.8 percent from 5.2 percent in October, and is expected to trim it further next month. But whether the downturn is mild or severe depends almost entirely on how the credit crisis plays out beyond the financial markets. Economists have long warned that easy credit terms were leading to asset bubbles, and many saw tightening credit conditions as a welcome development after years of excess. The concern is that panicky banks have now overcorrected, curbing credit to worthy borrowers and stifling economic growth. Banks have taken a $50 billion hit from bad loans, primarily tied to the U.S. subprime mortgage market, and analysts expect billions more in losses. That leaves less money for companies wanting to build new factories, or consumers hoping to remodel their homes, hurting economic growth. That is why central bankers are eager to restore confidence among lenders to get money flowing again. "The main problem in credit markets has not been that (interest) rates are too high, but that financial institutions have been unwilling to lend," said Alan Skrainka, chief market strategist at Edward Jones. "This added liquidity should relieve some of that pressure." The Fed's most recent survey of senior loan officers found credit terms tightening well beyond the housing market. About one-fifth of domestic banks surveyed said they tightened lending standards for commercial and industrial borrowers. One fourth of domestic banks reported tighter credit standards for consumer loans other than credit cards. Conditions looked somewhat better in Europe. ECB Vice President Lucas Papademos said there had been only limited spillover so far from tensions on the euro money market -- where banks get funding -- over to the interest rates that they charge businesses and consumers. "Neither the price of credit extended to the private sector nor the quantity of credit extended to the private sector has changed much," he said on Wednesday. But credit markets have clearly been feeling the strain as wary banks hoard cash. The spread between the London interbank offered rate, or Libor, and the Fed's key overnight lending rate remained abnormally wide, a sign that banks were holding back. Many economists said the actions announced on Wednesday were aimed at addressing that Libor anomaly. "It is likely to take months before spreads begin to narrow again, and will only happen once institutions begin to trust each other once more. And this will only happen when the frequency of write-downs begins to diminish," Commerzbank analyst Peter Dixon wrote in a note to clients. "That said, if we get through December without a major liquidity squeeze, the world is likely to look a brighter place come early January." (Editing by Frank McGurty)
