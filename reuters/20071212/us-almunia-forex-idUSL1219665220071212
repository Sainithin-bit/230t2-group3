 PARIS  (Reuters) - The Group of Seven must find a new consensus on currencies and Europe must come up with a single position ahead of the next G7 meeting in February, the EU's top economic official said on Wednesday. 

 EU Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Joaquin Almunia also warned against disorderly movements in currency markets and said European officials had last month urged China to hold off for the time being on any moves that could increase volatility in the foreign exchange markets. "It's not easy to reach a new consensus. I think we need one but it's not easy. In the consensus we need to have the non-European partners of course. We need the consensus of the Americans, the Japanese, the Canadians," he said. "But I would really at least like to have a serious, reasoned, solid, credible consensus among the Europeans of the G7. Those are the British...Germany, France and Italy, and there is also the ECB and the president of the (euro zone finance ministers) Eurogroup." Almunia called for discipline among European officials when talking about exchange rates. "I think that Mr (ECB President Jean-Claude) Trichet has all the reason in the world to ask government officials for discipline when we're talking in public about exchange rates." Finance officials from the G7, which comprises France, Germany, Italy, Canada, Britain, the United States and Japan, will meet in Tokyo on February 8. They last met in October in Washington where they turned up the heat on China to let its currency rise faster. They did not make any explicit mention of European concerns that a falling dollar is hurting euro zone competitiveness. The single currency, first launched on Jan 1, 1999, is up around 20 percent against the dollar in the last two years. In a sign of growing European concern, German finance minister Peer Steinbrueck said last week that currency moves were "disorderly". Referring to the G7 communique which could come out after the Tokyo meeting, he said: "It's possible that not only the punctuation changes but that the sentence in brackets with regard to the dollar might be more stringent." DOLLAR FALL HAS LIMITS European pleas are likely to fall on deaf ears as far as Washington is concerned. The Bush administration has repeated its line that a strong dollar is in U.S. interests but has shown little appetite to buck market trends. But Almunia said that there were limits to how far the dollar could move, a fact that he said was appreciated by U.S. officials. "The dollar is in the process of losing value. That helps adjust the American deficits," he said. "But the Americans are completely aware that it has its limits," he said. Britain also wants foreign exchange rates to be set by markets and has shown little interest in igniting a debate over what the G7 can do. Nor does there seem to be too much pressure in Tokyo for a change in G7 language now. Almunia, who visited China last month with Eurogroup chairman Jean-Claude Juncker and Trichet also said it was important for China to move to a flexible exchange rate. But he said they had warned China against any moves that could lead to increased volatility in exchange rate markets. Asked about what he told the Chinese about their purchases on foreign exchange markets, he said: "We told the Chinese: it's not the moment to take decisions, it's the moment to stay as you are and take decisions in other areas." "It's not the moment to increase volatility of foreign exchange rates but to reduce volatility of exchange rates because a big volatility in the current situation with the situation in financial markets will harm everyone."
