 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Five weeks ago, Sir Win Bischoff -- a virtual unknown in the U.S. financial world -- was named Citigroup's acting chief executive. 

 Now the German born, South Africa-educated Bischoff has again surprised Wall Street by snagging another top job at the troubled bank, this time in a more enduring role: chairman. Bischoff, 66, will work alongside newly appointed Chief Executive Vikram Pandit to try to reverse the recent slide in Citigroup's profits and share price following the ouster of former CEO Chuck Prince. While most of the immediate commentary following the long-awaited resolution of the succession at the largest U.S. bank focused on Pandit, Bischoff could also play a role, either in facilitating or slowing change at Citi. It won't be an easy task. The longtime London resident will have to squeeze his Citigroup duties in alongside nonexecutive director roles at McGraw Hill MHP.N, British real estate investment trust Land Securities Plc ( LAND.L ), drug company Eli Lilly & Co ( LLY.N ), Turkey's largest private lender Akbank and UK insurer Prudential Plc ( PRU.L ). Bischoff joined Citi via its acquisition in 2000 of the investment banking business of Schroders Plc, where he had been chairman since 1995. He then became chairman of Citi Europe, where he chaired the bank's business in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. That global experience is one advantage of his appointment, said Bill Fitzpatrick, an analyst at Johnson Family Funds in Racine, Wisconsin. "Just the fact that they have someone from over there take on the chairman's role just gives a little more credence to the global presence they have," he said. "That's a differentiator for Citigroup." Bischoff, who prior to the interim CEO post had not run a financial institution day-to-day for some time, replaces former U.S. Treasury Secretary and Goldman Sachs ( GS.N ) co-Chairman Robert Rubin, whom the bank is reported to have unsuccessfully tried to convince to stay in the chairman job. Winfried Franz Wilhelm Bischoff received his early education in Cologne and Dusseldorf, Germany, but moved to South Africa as a teenager, where he earned his undergraduate degree.
