 BERLIN  (Reuters) - Greece has no need for external financing currently so it would not be a problem if the next aid tranche for the debt-plagued country were delayed by a few weeks, a German finance ministry spokesman said on Friday. 
 "As far as I am aware, there is no current need for external financing up until beyond the first half of the year," spokesman Martin Kotthaus told a regular news conference in Berlin. He added that a delay of a few weeks would be "unproblematic." Earlier, Kotthaus said Greece's lenders would need a positive report on its reform progress before releasing a planned second tranche of aid worth around 4 billion euros at the end of June. Greece holds its second election in less than two months on June 17 in which a radical leftist party opposed to the EU-IMF austerity program is expected to perform well.
