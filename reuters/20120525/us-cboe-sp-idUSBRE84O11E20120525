 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - CBOE Holdings ( CBOE.O ) won court backing Friday in its long-running legal battle to prevent rival International Securities Exchange from listing options on the Standard & Poor 500 Index, one of CBOE's most popular and profitable products. 
 The Illinois Appellate Court on Friday issued a ruling forbidding ISE from listing S&P 500 options, which are licensed exclusively to CBOE by McGraw-Hill MHP.N and CME Group's ( CME.O ) index services unit, according to a statement from CBOE. The ruling, which also applies to options on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, stems from a 2006 lawsuit by CBOE and McGraw-Hill against ISE to prevent it from listing the contracts. "No third party should be able to interfere with contractual licensing agreements," CBOE Chairman and CEO William Brodsky said in a statement. "Nor should any exchange have a free ride on the enormous investment CBOE made in creating options on these indexes and in developing and marketing them for over two decades." ISE is owned by Eurex, a Frankfurt-based futures exchange co-owned by Deutsche Boerse AG ( DB1Gn.DE ). "We will evaluate all of the options to determine next steps but have no additional comment at this time," an ISE spokeswoman said. (Reporting by  Ann Saphir ; Editing by  Tim Dobbyn )
