 MADRID  (Reuters) - Spain's troubled Bankia, which asked for a state bailout of 19 billion euros on Friday, also revealed a 2.979 billion euro ($3.73 billion) loss for 2011 after restating its accounts. 
 The bank had stated in early May, before the state started a nationalisation process, that it had made a profit of just over 300 million euros for last year. Bankia has since reviewed its loan portfolios and capital needs to assess how much bailout money it needed. ($1 = 0.7992 euros) (Reporting by Sarah White; Editing by  Fiona Ortiz )
