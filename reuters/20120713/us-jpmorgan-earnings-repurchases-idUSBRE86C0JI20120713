 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co. said it had reached a turning point in demands to buy back mortgages, allowing it to reduce its reserve for repurchases last quarter by about $215 million. 
 JPMorgan and other big U.S. banks have been forced contractually repurchase billions of dollars of mortgages sold to Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and mortgage-backed securities investors because of misrepresentations of credit quality. The nation's biggest bank has repurchased about $3.4 billion of mortgages, but "we have reached the inflection point," Chief Financial Officer Doug Braunstein said in a call with bank analysts on Friday. "The net repurchase number should be approximately zero for the next quarter." His remarks came as JPMorgan announced second-quarter results and explained the multibillion-dollar loss this year in its Chief Investment Office.
