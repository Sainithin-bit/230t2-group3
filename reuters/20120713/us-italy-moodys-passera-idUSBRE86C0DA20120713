 ROME  (Reuters) - The downgrade of Italy by ratings agency Moody's is unjustified and misleading, Italian Industry Minister Corrado Passera said on Friday. 
 The cut of Italy's rating by two notches to Baa2 is "altogether unjustified and even misleading," Passera said at a conference in Rome. The move by Moody's, which warned it could reduce the country's rating further, rattled investors shortly before an Italian bond sale. (Reporting By Stefano Bernabei)
