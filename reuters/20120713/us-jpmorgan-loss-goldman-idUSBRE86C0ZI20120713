 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co said Irvin Goldman, who was briefly chief risk officer of the Chief Investment Office that lost $5.8 billion on derivatives trades, has resigned. 
 "Irv asked to leave the company. He's behaved with integrity and we wish him well," the firm said in a statement. Goldman was named chief risk officer on February 1, around the time that problems with the portfolio began to mount. He left that post as part of a May 14 overhaul of the CIO. Goldman's brother-in-law Barry Zubrow runs the firm's office of corporate and regulatory affairs and until early this year was chief risk officer for the entire company.
