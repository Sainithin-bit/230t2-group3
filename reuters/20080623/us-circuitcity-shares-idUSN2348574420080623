 ATLANTA  (Reuters) - Shares of Circuit City Stores CC.N fell more than 18 percent on Monday after analysts cited market concerns about the electronic retailer's ability to turn its business around and prospects for a sale. 

 One analyst said movie-rental company Blockbuster Inc BBI.N could lower its takeover bid for Circuit City after it posted a wider first-quarter loss on Thursday on plummeting sales, and suspended its dividend to save cash. The Richmond, Virginia, retailer also said it would cut back on capital spending and forecast a wider loss for the current quarter. "The core problem is that management continues to talk about getting traction and remaining positive on the turnaround, but the sales numbers have gotten worse," said Dan Binder, an analyst with Jefferies & Co. Arvind Bhatia, a Blockbuster analyst with Sterne, Agee & Leach, said on Monday the weak Circuit City results could lead Blockbuster to alter its takeover bid. In April, Blockbuster disclosed that it had offered to buy Circuit City for $6 to $8 a share, or up to $1.3 billion. Circuit City opened its financial books to Blockbuster last month but said it was still exploring strategic options last week. "What we thought after looking at the results was that there was the very high possibility that Blockbuster would not be able to offer the same price as it had before," Bhatia said. "The cash burn rate had been much higher than we had expected," Bhatia added. "That's something that anybody acquiring or taking a look at Circuit City would have to take into consideration." Circuit City said its cash position fell to $92.2 million as of May 31 from $364.1 million a year earlier. Bhatia said a more likely outcome is that Blockbuster lowers its bid to $4 to $5 a share for Circuit City, but he also said the movie-rental company could walk away from a deal or keep its original offer. He said he expected an update from Blockbuster in two weeks or so. On the New York Stock Exchange, Circuit City fell 81 cents, or 18.9 percent, to $3.47, while Blockbuster rose 1 cent, or 0.4 percent, to $2.53 in early-afternoon trading. On Thursday Circuit City's shares fell 1.7 percent to close at $3.98 on the quarterly results, but rose about 7 percent to $4.28 on Friday.
