 LONDON  (Reuters) - Increased cost pressures on airlines combined with lower spending power among customers could force a new round of consolidation between carriers, say bankers, analysts and industry executives. 

 Fuel is one of the biggest costs airlines face and the price of oil has doubled in the last year. But airlines may be unable to pass on that cost as businesses and holidaymakers face pressure to spend less as the economy slows. High passenger traffic in the upcoming European summer and holiday season could boost airlines' cashflow but come September or October some could face enough pressure to force them into deals. "I think we will finally see sensible consolidation in the industry, possibly once the cash flows start to contract after the holiday season," said one senior European airline executive. "It's a twelve-month view." Analysts and many industry executives expect consolidation to be centered around Europe's three dominant network carriers - the UK's British Airways BAY.L, Germany's Lufthansa ( LHAG.DE ) and France's Air France KLM ( AIRF.PA ) - which are expected to be the main survivors. Low-cost airlines Ryanair ( RYA.I ) and Easyjet ( EZJ.L ) are also expected by some to come out on top in any consolidation round. "Airlines are operating an unprofitable business structure," said Andrew Fitchie, transport analyst at Collins Stewart. "They could go down the course of self-help, or they could merge to maintain a network but with fewer planes." "Lots of smaller players out there will wither, but even the big guys are unprofitable at this level. There is the huge cost of fuel, just as the cycle is turning downwards." But consolidation still faces obstacles including a natural temptation for cash-strapped airlines to try to invest in themselves rather than splash out on a rival. They also face possible opposition from national governments, which still often own shares in their national carriers and have so far made such deals difficult. Air France-KLM's talks to buy Italian rival Alitalia AZPIa.MI collapsed earlier this year after the French carrier failed to reach agreement with unions and incoming prime minister Silvio Berlusconi labeled the idea of such a foreign-led deal "unacceptable." Madrid-based Iberia IBLA.MC, a bastion of national protectionism since the years of dictator Francisco Franco, has long been defended as a Spanish holding, battling takeovers from abroad from rivals tempted by the airline's big route network to South America. Madrid's local government helped block a pre-sale verbal agreement between savings bank Caja Madrid, one of Iberia's largest shareholders, and US private equity firm TPG, which offered as much as 3.60 euros per share in a joint offer with rival British Airways. "I think the main issue so far has been the reluctance of some governments to allowing deals to go ahead," said a senior M&A banker. "That has to change if we are going to see any real consolidation." But the sheer volume of losses among some European airlines could make governments more open to allowing deals as they try to limit the bill to taxpayers. Italy's national carrier Alitalia AZPIa.MI, for example, is only still flying due to a 300 million euro government loan after the collapse of its planned sale to Air France-KLM ( AIRF.PA ) left it at bankruptcy's door. "I think governments may finally be ready to stand back and let this (consolidation) happen," said the airline executive.
