 DETROIT  (Reuters) - General Motors Corp confirmed on Monday it is offering zero-percent financing for 72 months on most of its 2008 models and has hired Citibank to advise on the ongoing review of its Hummer brand. 

 Citibank will help the No.1 U.S. automaker with the review, including assessing any potential offers from potential buyers for the military-derived SUV line, U.S. sales chief Mark LaNeve told reporters on a conference call.
