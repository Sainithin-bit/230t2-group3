 DETROIT  (Reuters) - General Motors Corp said on Monday it plans to reduce pickup truck and SUV production by 170,000 units in the second half of the year, while increasing the output of cars. 

 A GM spokesman said the automaker plans to increase production of cars and crossovers by 47,000 units through overtime at certain plants. Summer shutdowns will be extended in 7 GM truck plants to throttle back production. A few plants will also have additional shutdowns later this year. (Reporting by  Poornima Gupta )
