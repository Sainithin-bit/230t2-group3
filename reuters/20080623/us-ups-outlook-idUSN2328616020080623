 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - United Parcel Service Inc ( UPS.N ) warned on Monday that second-quarter earnings would be below expectations, blaming high fuel prices and a sluggish U.S. economy. 

 The announcement from the world's largest package delivery company came less than a week after rival FedEx Corp ( FDX.N ) issued a weak fiscal 2009 forecast and posted a quarterly loss, also citing rising fuel prices and an ailing economy. UPS estimated earnings of 83 cents to 88 cents a share for the quarter, down from a prior view of 97 cents to $1.04 per share. In a statement, UPS said U.S. package volume had been lower than expected, while demand for higher-priced air delivery services had seen a particular drop. Keith Schoonmaker, an analyst at Morningstar, said the warning from UPS was hardly a surprise, given the monstrous head winds the industry faces. "This just shows that in a challenging economic environment, with high fuel prices, that some customers are shifting to slower, cheaper shipping alternatives" within both UPS and its rivals, he said. He said the company's ability to impose fuel surcharges on its customers meant UPS would ultimately recoup higher fuels costs -- although there tends to be a lag. UPS is the latest company to warn of the toll that higher commodity costs are taking on its bottom line. Earlier on Monday, United Air Lines, a unit of UAL Corp UAUA.O, said it was laying off nearly 1,000 pilots as it takes 100 aircraft out of service to deal with "record high oil prices and a softening U.S. economy." It warned its competitors "are facing similar decisions in response to this unprecedented environment." In May, farm equipment leader Deere & Co ( DE.N ) forecast disappointing full-year earnings, blaming global steel prices its chief finance officer said were "racing ahead" of expectations. And late Monday, Deere rival CNH Global NV CNH.N said it was slapping a 5 percent surcharge on its farm equipment, "in response to sharp and sustained increases in its costs for steel, energy, commodities and transportation." But given the out-sized role that fuel plays in expenses, freight and package haulers are especially feeling the pinch. Adding pressure is the slowdown in the U.S. economy, which has depressed business and left too many truckers chasing too little freight. That has forced many independent truckers -- and some bigger outfits -- to file for bankruptcy protection. Among the victims: Jevic Transportation Inc, a so-called less-than-truckload shipper, owned an affiliate of private equity firm Sun Capital, which filed in May. As a result, truckmakers such as Paccar Inc ( PCAR.O ) are seeing weak demand for their pricey big rigs this year. That weakness helped push Caterpillar Inc <CAT.N. into announcing earlier this month that it would stop making diesel engines for the North American commercial vehicle market after 2009, ending a nearly 50-year-long chapter in its history that made the company a part of American trucker lore.
