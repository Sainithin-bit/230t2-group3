 MELBOURNE  (Reuters) - Costco Wholesale Corp ( COST.O ) has gained its first foothold in the Australian market in a bid to shake up a dominant supermarket duopoly. 

 Costco, whose U.S. warehouses sell everything from groceries to big-screen TVs, has secured a site for a large-format store in the developing Docklands area in inner city Melbourne, Costco's Australian country manager Patrick Noone said. "We just got the planning approval, it will be a 13,800 square meter store, similar in size to a North American-style Costco store," Noone told Reuters in a telephone interview. He said the Melbourne store, opening next year, would sell a similarly wide range of goods, from food to diamond jewellery, and talks with suppliers have already begun. "We'll be stocking everything from cut meat, fresh food, groceries, electronics, hardware and clothing. And jewellery," Noone said. With its slim margins and low-cost structure, Costco has the ability to aggressively challenge rival retailers on price, analysts said. Customers pay an annual fee to shop at the company's warehouse locations. Costco is one of three foreign companies trying to break into the Australian grocery sector, and Noone said he has plans for stores in most major cities given the lack of competition. Australia's grocery sector is dominated by Woolworths Ltd's ( WOW.AX ) 770 supermarkets and the Coles chain of 740 stores, owned by Wesfarmers Ltd WES.AX. The two have an 80 percent market share, followed by smaller player Metcash Ltd ( MTS.AX ) which supplies independents. They are facing a competition inquiry into grocery prices, which has been told there is little difference between the prices of most products on rival stores' supermarket shelves. The inquiry was also told of barriers to new entrants. The two other international grocers, privately owned Aldi and Franklins, owned by South Africa's Pick 'n Pay Stores Ltd ( PIKJ.J ), said they have been blocked from gaining access to new shopping centre sites because of landlord agreements with the big two players that discourage rivals from existing malls. Costco has been looking for sites for more than a year. Aldi has a 3 percent national market share, and a 7 percent share in the eastern states where it operates, and aims to have 500 stores in the next five years. Costco, which targets more upscale shoppers than larger rival Wal-Mart Stores Inc ( WMT.N ), will challenge not only the grocers but hardware chain Bunnings, owned by Wesfarmers, and electronics retailers such as Harvey Norman ( HVN.AX ). "Everyone in retail is going to be impacted by these guys, because of the broadness of the offer, though retailers with a value proposition are going to be possibly more affected," said one Sydney-based retail analyst. "They are a tough competitor." ($1=A$1.05) (Editing by James Thornhill)
