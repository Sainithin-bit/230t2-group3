 LONDON  (Reuters) - Oil rose more than $1 a barrel on Middle East tension on Monday, boosting energy-related equities while the euro was hit by a raft of data showing increasing euro zone economic weakness. 

 Wall Street looked set for a positive start after near 2-percent losses on Friday. Equities in Japan fell to a near 1-month low. Europe suffered from a wave of poor economic reports. Euro zone services and manufacturing activity both contracted in June, hit by slowing demand and rising energy costs, while price pressures surged, RBS/Markit indexes showed. Similar data also showed French growth in both manufacturing and services contracting and German growth in the sectors slowing. German corporate sentiment weakened significantly in June, according to the Munich-based Ifo economic research institute. The reports, reflecting a long-held belief that Europe would follow the U.S. economy in slowing down, were seen as putting pressure on the European Central Bank, which, like others, is trying to balance slowing economic activity with rising inflationary pressures. "The ECB's policy dilemma has increased," said Jacques Cailloux, chief euro area economist at RBS, which sponsors the data. The reports weighed for a while on equities, but higher global oil priced lifted energy stocks, supporting indexes. The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was up 0.2 percent. "Markets are oversold after last week, and that in itself should give us a few days of respite," said Mike Lenhoff, chief strategist at Brewin Dolphin. Earlier, Japan's Nikkei stock average slid 0.6 percent to a nearly one-month closing low. It lost 84.61 points to 13,857.47, its lowest since May 28. The broader Topix shed 0.7 percent to 1,347.93. OIL RISES, EURO FALLS Escalating tension between Israel and Iran stoked supply concerns and traders doubted whether top exporter Saudi Arabia's promise to pump more oil, if needed, would turn back the rally. U.S. light crude for August delivery was up more than $1.15 a barrel at $136.53. Iran's defence minister was quoted as saying on Sunday that his country would give a "devastating" response to any attack. On Friday, the New York Times quoted U.S. officials as saying Israel had carried out a large military exercise, apparently a rehearsal for a potential bombing of Iran's nuclear facilities. This mood overwhelmed confirmation from Saudi Arabia that it would lift production in July, a move that briefly weakened the oil price. On foreign exchanges, meanwhile, the euro was hit by the poor data and the dollar benefited as some investors bet on a hawkish message from the Federal Reserve later in the week. "The data was quite weak this morning in the euro zone and so we have a slight bear bias on the euro today," said Carole Laulhere, currency strategist at Societe Generale. "At the same time the market is waiting for the (Federal Reserve) on Wednesday and is just judging whether the Fed will tighten soon on inflation." The euro was down 0.6 percent at $1.5519 while the dollar index against major currencies rose 0.7 percent. The euro fell 0.2 percent to 167.11 yen. Euro zone government bond prices firmed, sending yields lower. The interest rate-sensitive two-year Schatz yield was down 4 basis points at 4.562 percent and the 10-year Bund yield was down 3 basis points at 4.597 percent. (Editing by Gerrard Raven)
