 LONDON/SEOUL  (Reuters) - U.S. corn futures fell on Monday, pulled down by improving weather in the Midwest, but concerns over poor yields and rising crude oil prices supported the market. 

 "Even with better weather on the horizon, the crop isn't going to be as good as it would have been," said David Hart, senior research analyst at Fat Prophets in London. "It is really important for the crops to have germinated and begin growing earlier in the year and the later that begins the lower the yields." Commodity markets were also pressured by continued talk of tighter regulation following news that U.S. Senator Joseph Lieberman unveiled last week three legislative proposals aimed at limiting speculation in the crude oil futures market. "But the market could receive some support again this week as the (Federal Open Market Committee) meets to decide interest rates and we expect a slight fall in the U.S. dollar," said a trader at Woori Futures. The U.S. Federal Reserve will hold a two-day meeting on interest rates on Tuesday and the central bank is unlikely to deliver a greenback-friendly rate hike, with Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke's views behind closed doors seeming to imply no move planned for now.  OIL UP Oil rose more than $1 on Monday as escalating tensions between Israel and Iran stoked supply concerns and as Saudi Arabia's promise to pump more oil if needed failed to win over a skeptical market.  July corn futures were down 1.21 percent to $7.12-1/2 a bushel at 6:57 a.m. EDT ahead of updated corn acreage estimates on June 30 by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The agency plans to conduct a special survey of six Midwestern states this week to gauge the impact of heavy rains and spring flooding on crops. Soybean futures were weighed by expectations that some ruined corn acres would be reseeded with soybeans, which can be planted later in the season, while expectations of a pick-up in soy shipments from Argentina also pressured the grain. Argentine truckers protesting a drawn-out conflict between the government and farmers began lifting roadblocks on Friday as farmers prepared to end their latest strike against a tax hike on soy exports.  Argentina is the world's largest soymeal exporter, and the conflict paralyzed shipments, resulting in a shift of some soy export business to the United States. Chicago's July soy contract SN8 dropped 0.9 percent to $15.18-3/4 a bushel. Wheat also followed the retreat in corn and soybean, with the July contract down 1.5 percent to $8.53-1/2 a bushel. "There is probably going to be lot of sympathy within the complex," said Hart. "The impact of weather related events will be helping those (wheat and soybean) markets as well to settle down." India is considering releasing some wheat into the open market as production is expected to touch a record high of 78 million tonnes in 2008, the farm minister said on Monday.  In Paris, Euronext wheat futures fell sharply, gapping lower at the opening after a series of sell-stops were triggered. Benchmark November futures then stabilized, prompting traders to say they expected limited declines from current levels, at least in the near term. "We have seen the biggest part of the correction. Now we are in stand-by mode, hovering in a range of between 198 and 202 euros per tonne," one trader said. "We'd need to see some fresh news to go lower still."
