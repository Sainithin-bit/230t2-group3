 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Investment bank Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ) said it had appointed Yoshihiko Shigenari head of its private equity unit in Japan as it strengthens its business in the world's second-largest economy. 

 Shigenari, who is now co-head of the bank's investment banking division in Tokyo, will assume the new position at Morgan Stanley Capital on July 1, the bank said in a statement on Monday. He joined Morgan Stanley in 1989. Morgan Stanley's private equity business, which has invested in various companies in China, South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore, has not made any investments in Japan since 2000 when it bought a stake in internet access provider eAccess Ltd 9427.T. "This appointment clearly underscores our commitment to expanding our private equity franchise," Stephen Trevor, co-head of Morgan Stanley Private Equity said in the statement. The U.S. firm in May set up a private equity division in India. (Reporting by  Junko Fujita )
