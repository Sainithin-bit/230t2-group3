 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Wall Street anticipates the U.S. Federal Reserve will hold short-term interest rates steady this week for the first time since it began a rapid easing cycle last September as the central bank weighs rising inflationary concerns against a still weak economy. 

 With no action on rates seen as a done deal at the meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday, market participants will scrutinize the Fed's statement due at 2:15 p.m. EDT on Wednesday for hints about the future course of policy. Analysts say the Fed may refrain from clearly stating a risk bias toward growth or inflation. A spate of anti-inflation rhetoric by Fed officials earlier this month heightened speculation of a near-term rate rise. Interest-rate futures on Monday morning had fully priced in a quarter-percentage point rise in the overnight federal funds rate in September. But many economists expect the central bank to keep its powder dry through the end of the year. There also may even be dissent within the Fed, with at least one member calling for higher rates. The Fed has cut the benchmark lending rate by a total of 3.25 percentage points to 2 percent since mid-September. Following are some factors Fed policy-makers will considering: ECONOMY Fed officials have said the risks of a substantial economic downturn have eased, but housing sector data remains dismal, business investment is weak and unemployment has risen sharply. Housing starts fell 3.3 percent in May to an annual pace of 975,000, the lowest since March 1991, while permits for future building slipped 1.3 percent. The unemployment rate jumped 5.5 percent for May, the highest in more than 3-1/2 years. Some 49,000 jobs were cut from payrolls in May, the fifth straight month of declines. Industrial production unexpectedly slipped 0.2 percent in May. Factory activity in the U.S. Mid-Atlantic region showed a steeper-than-expected drop in June and its seventh straight monthly drop, according to the Philadelphia Fed. Meanwhile, service-sector activity grew in May for a second straight month, according to the Institute for Supply Management, while retail sales rose a strong 1 percent, partly boosted by government rebate checks. Growth in U.S. gross domestic product was revised higher to an annual rate of 0.9 percent from 0.6 percent annualized in the first quarter. INFLATION Overall prices marched upward, reflecting surges in food and energy prices, but core prices, which exclude food and energy, were relatively calm. The U.S. Consumer Price Index rose 0.6 percent in May, while core CPI edged up just 0.2 percent. The Producer Price Index rose 1.4 percent in May while core PPI rose just 0.2 percent. U.S. import prices rose 2.3 percent in May. A measure of inflation expectations, the TIPS breakeven spread, has widened by about a quarter-percentage point from a month ago as market players fretted about higher inflation. The Reuters/University of Michigan's gauge of one-year inflation expectations edged down to 5.1 percent from May's 5.2 percent, just off the highest in 26 years. Five-year inflation expectations held steady at May's peak of 3.4 percent, which was the highest since April 1995. FINANCIAL SYSTEM Concerns over the financial system flared as banks' weaknesses were exposed by an ongoing credit crisis originating from a U.S. housing downturn. Lehman LEH.N reported a $2.8 billion loss for its second quarter and raised $6 billion in fresh capital. Merrill Lynch & Co MER.N shares fell sharply on Friday on rumors that the bank may issue a profit warning and take additional write-downs on its mortgage holdings. Borrowing by banks and brokerages from the central bank remained at high levels. Since March, the central bank has provided a channel for primary dealers, which include investment banks and brokerages, to borrow overnight funds directly from the Fed. RECENT COMMENTS Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke, June 9: "The risk that the economy has entered a substantial downturn appears to have diminished over the past month or so ... the latest round of increases in energy prices has added to the upside risks to inflation and inflation expectations. The Federal Open Market Committee will strongly resist an erosion of longer-term inflation expectations, as an unanchoring of those expectations would be destabilizing for growth as well as for inflation." Bernanke, June 3: "For now, policy seems well positioned to promote moderate growth and price stability over time ... we are attentive to the implications of changes in the value of the dollar for inflation and inflation expectations."
