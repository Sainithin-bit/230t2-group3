 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Olympus Corp President Shuichi Takayama told its lenders on Wednesday the firm would announce its first-half results by December 14, a deadline to keep its listing on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, a banking source said. 
 Olympus executives met a group of about 100 bankers from about 40 banks earlier on Wednesday to apologize for the scandal and ask for their support. Tokyo's stock exchange has warned scandal-hit Olympus it will be delisted after 62 years as a publicly traded company if it fails to report earnings by December 14, deepening concerns about the camera-maker's future.
