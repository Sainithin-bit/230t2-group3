 (Reuters) - Banks are shedding jobs worldwide as stricter regulations and a tough six months for trading income take their toll on investment banking units. 
 France's BNP Paribas is only one of the latest banks to confirm they are also cutting jobs. At Citigroup ( C.N ), more than 3,000 staff could go. Italy's UniCredit ( CRDI.MI ) said on Monday it was cutting 6,150 jobs as part of a strategy revamp, while Japan's Mizuho Financial group Inc ( 8411.T ) is making 3,000 layoffs as it merges two banking units. The layoff plans brings staff cuts announced this year or reported to be in the works at major banks to 123,000, some of them to be lost over three- or four-year programs. The job cut estimates are likely to be conservative figures, as not all banks trimming teams have publicly announced lay-offs, and the number does not take into account smaller investment banks, boutiques and brokers.
