 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - An index of U.S. economic health rose for an eight straight month in February, suggesting the U.S. economic recovery remains well positioned to withstand challenges like high unemployment and rising energy price. 

 The Conference Board's index of leading indicators rose 0.8 percent in February, following a 0.1 percent gain in the prior month, according to a report released on Thursday. That was below forecasts for a 1 percent gain in a Reuters poll of economists. Still, the gain points to "an economic expansion that should gather momentum in the coming months," said Ataman Ozyildirim, economist at the industry-led research group. U.S. gross domestic product rose 2.8 percent in the fourth quarter, but the unemployment rate remains at a historically-elevated 8.9 percent. The jobless rate has been coming down in recent months, but employers are still showing some reluctance to hire. The report said the economy faces some serious hurdles ahead despite recent strides. "One headwind is the sharp rise in food and energy prices," said Ken Goldstein, another economist at the group. "Still, the way inflation will move is unclear, given the degree of slack in the overall economy, and especially in the labor market."
