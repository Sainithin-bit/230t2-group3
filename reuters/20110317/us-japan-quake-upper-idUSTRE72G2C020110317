 TOKYO  (Reuters) - The speaker of the upper house of Japan's parliament suggested on Thursday that it might be an option to close the Tokyo stock market and foreign exchange market for about a week, because of the confusion caused by a massive quake and tsunami disaster and a nuclear crisis at a quake-hit plant, Kyodo news agency reported.
