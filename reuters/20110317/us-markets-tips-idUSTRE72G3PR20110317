 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Breakeven rates on U.S. Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities extend their earlier rise on Thursday after data showed stronger-than-expected increases in consumer prices in February. 

 These rates gauge the yields between TIPS and regular U.S. government debt, and the Federal Reserve and analysts monitor them to track investors' inflation expectations. Political turmoil in the Middle East and North Africa and bad crop weather have made oil and food prices surge worldwide this year. The Fed has acknowledged the increases in short-term inflation but maintains that long-term inflation expectations remained anchored. TIPS are indexed against the government's Consumer Price Index, which rose 0.5 percent last month. It was the biggest monthly increase in 1-1/2 years. This compared with a median forecast of a 0.4 percent increase among analysts polled by Reuters. The core CPI rate, which excludes volatile energy and food prices, rose 0.2 percent, also more than analysts had expected. "That's one sign of strength on inflation going forward," said Eric Van Nostrand, interest rate strategist at Credit Suisse in New York. "That said this is not problematic inflation. But the Fed will have to watch inflation expectations going forward." The breakeven rates on five-year securities were last quoted at 2.20 percent, up 5 basis points from late Wednesday, according to Tradeweb. Ten-year breakevens were last quoted at 2.42 percent, 3 basis points wider than Wednesday's close. (Reporting by  Richard Leong ; Editing by  James Dalgleish )
