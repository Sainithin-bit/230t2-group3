 LONDON  (Reuters) - Uncertainty about how Japan's nuclear crisis will be resolved and the high chances of Japanese intervention will keep yen volatility high, but a climb to record levels seen after the Lehman collapse looks unlikely. 

 The yen's surge to a record high of 76.25 per dollar vaulted one-month dollar/yen implied volatility up to 19.3 percent on Thursday, its highest since early 2009, as investors use options to hedge against more erratic yen moves. By late European trade, vols had pulled back to 17 percent. A further sustained fall in dollar/yen that goes unchecked by Japanese authorities could push implied volatility much higher, but many in the market believe they will step in at some point to stem yen strength. That is likely to add some choppiness to the pair. Analysts do not rule out the possibility one-month volatility could rise toward 25 percent. But this would be far short of the all-time high of 45 percent hit in October 2008, according to IFR, in the aftermath of the Lehman Brothers collapse, because investors do not expect a repeat of that breakdown in financial markets. "Barring something utterly catastrophic, I don't see volatility testing historic levels again," said Olivier Korber, options strategist at Societe Generale in Paris. "Twenty-five percent would be the next psychological level if the situation were to worsen." Implied vols are used by currency traders and investors to minimize the impact of big falls in the spot market. Korber said his main scenario was that vols would fall slowly, while any upside would be capped at 25 percent. The 45 percent all-time high in one-month implied vols coincided with a one-day fall in spot dollar/yen from above 99.00 yen to below 91.00 yen. Credit Agricole options analyst Simon Smollett said a further climb in implied vol to around 22 percent was possible, while adding such levels were extremely high even given the current market uncertainty. He added that any downside would be limited to around 12.5-13.5 percent. Given that the latest spike up in implied vol happened in thin liquidity, analysts warned the market was equally vulnerable to a big move either to the upside or downside in the near term. But any pullback would be subdued because some investors would see a slide as an opportunity to stock up on shorter-dated options to maximize profits if spot moves become more erratic. CHANGED LANDSCAPE One-month implied vols have jumped from around 8 percent hit less than a week ago, its lowest in more than three years, and analysts say levels around 17-20 percent reflect a market which is on the edge and sees a 1 percent daily move in spot dollar/yen every day for a month. The dollar has plummeted roughly 7 yen since Friday, and fell roughly 3 percent on the day on Wednesday, its biggest one-day loss since May. The drop from around 81 yen to 76.25 yen on Wednesday wiped out dollar/yen options with strike prices contained in that range, leaving investors short but very wary of taking on fresh long positions at current levels. "The landscape has changed. There's nobody who is long on options with 76 yen strikes," Credit Agricole's Smollett said. "There might be some people with strikes at 79, but there's nothing down here, so the market is short again. That's why prices are so high."
