 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Mizuho Bank said its automatic teller machines were back up and running across Japan after a shutdown earlier on Thursday, the latest disruption to business and daily life in Japan after last week's devastating earthquake. 

 Mizuho, Japan's second-largest bank by assets, said its ATMs and Internet transactions were operating normally as of noon (11 p.m. ET Wednesday) in Japan, though customers were still unable to make foreign currency withdrawals. Mizuho said it did not know the exact cause of the shutdown. The bank operated 5,622 ATMs and 440 branches in Japan as of September, making it a key component of the Japanese financial system. About 570 billion yen ($7.3 billion) worth of transactions had already been disrupted by system troubles in the two business days following Friday's massive earthquake, with consumers unable to conduct cash transfers, money orders and other transactions. A Mizuho spokesman said the reason for the ATM shutdown was not known. He said it was unlikely due to this week's power outages in the Tokyo area and eastern Japan or the earthquake. It is holding a briefing on its systems from 0400 GMT. Mizuho has a history of system troubles In 2002 a computer glitch disabled a then nationwide network of 7,000 ATMs, preventing millions of customers from withdrawing cash. Shares of Mizuho were down 2.2 percent at 134 yen, against a 1.8 percent fall in the benchmark Nikkei 225 average. (Reporting by Mariko Katsumura; Editing by  Nathan Layne )
