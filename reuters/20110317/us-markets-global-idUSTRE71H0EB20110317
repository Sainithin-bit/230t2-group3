 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - European and U.S. stocks rebounded from three days of selling on Thursday despite no resolution to Japan's nuclear plant crisis, while the yen edged off a record high against the U.S. dollar. 

 Despite the rise in stocks, fear still clouded markets across the globe as Japan's responses to its worsening nuclear disaster looked increasingly desperate. New issues in the stock and loans markets were postponed and equity trading volumes dipped. Fears that tensions in the Middle East and North Africa added to the unease weighing on markets and drove oil prices up nearly 4 percent. The yen's strength may also have reflected expectations that Japanese investors would sell overseas assets to bring home funds to pay for reconstruction after Friday's earthquake and tsunami. The yen hit a record high against the dollar of 76.25 yen as Asian markets began trading. The Group of Seven finance leaders and central bankers planned to hold a conference call later on Thursday. Currency traders have interpreted remarks by some officials as indicating other central banks may give Japan their blessing to intervene to drive the yen lower against the dollar. The three-day decline in stocks brought back bargain hunters, but volume on Wall Street was lackluster. Developments at Japan's quake-hit nuclear plant still unnerved investors. Japanese military helicopters dumped water and a water canon was used on an overheating nuclear reactor, but radiation levels at the plant remained high. "As the headlines come out of Japan, there are more nervous traders liquidating their long positions in futures put on this morning," said Steve Leuer, stock-index futures trader at X-FA Trading firm in Chicago. The MSCI world equity index .MIWD00000PUS gained 1.3 percent after hitting a three-month low earlier in the week. The index has now erased all of this year's gains. Tokyo stocks ended down 1.4 percent  .N225  on Thursday. Earlier this week, Japanese stocks suffered their worst two-day selloff since 1987. The Thomson Reuters global stock index  .TRXFLDGLPU  gained 0.8 percent. The FTSEurofirst 300 index  .FTEU3  rose 1.8 percent as a recent sell-off attracted bargain hunters. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  rose 161.29 points, or 1.39 percent, at 11,774.59. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  increased 16.84 points, or 1.34 percent, to 1,273.72 and the Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  climbed 19.23 points, or 0.73 percent, to 2,636.05. The index known as Wall Street's fear gauge, the VIX, .VIX, fell 9 percent to 26.77 on Thursday, a day after hitting its highest level since July. Natural resource stocks were among key leaders as commodities rebounded. Cliffs Natural Resources Inc ( CLF.N ) rose 5.8 percent to $88.60 and Chevron Corp ( CVX.N ) gained 2.7 percent to $102.24. The S&P energy index .GSPE rose 3 percent, leading gains in the S&P 500, even though the prospect of higher fuel costs have tempered stock investor enthusiasm in recent weeks. Many traders warned there were still reasons to be cautious as Japan had yet to contain its nuclear problem, which could exacerbate the natural disaster's economic toll. "The drop has been violent, but the news flow remains very alarming," said David Thebault, head of quantitative sales trading at Global Equities in Paris. "There is short covering at this point, and we continue to see outflows. "Stocks might look oversold on the short term, but they are not if we're heading into a bear market, he added. In Europe, ISS, the Danish outsourcing group, pulled its potential $2.8 billion stock market listing, becoming Europe's biggest casualty of choppy markets. Emerging market stocks .MSCIEF fell 0.6 percent. U.S. crude oil rose 3.4 percent to settle at $101.42 a barrel. Brent crude for May delivery settled up 3.89 percent at $114.90, after hitting a session high of $115.39. It was the biggest one-day percentage gain since February 23. as unrest in Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Libya heightened concern about supply disruption while investors weighed the impact on energy demand from Japan. The state-owned Bahrain Petroleum Co has partly shut down production due to staff shortages caused by political unrest in Bahrain, trade sources said. Bahrain arrested at least six opposition leaders, a day after its crackdown on protests by the Shi'ite Muslim majority raised fears of a regional conflict. INTERVENTION THREAT In New York, the yen traded at around 78.96 per dollar, off the record high set overnight. Japanese margin traders were cited as one of the main factors behind the dollar's fall against the yen, as the break of the yen's prior record high triggered automatic sell orders. Traders also said foreign investors were scrambling to get hold of yen to settle margin calls on bets on Japanese shares, forcing them to turn to spot currency at times as well as forwards and cross-currency swaps. Japanese Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda blamed speculation for the yen spike. The dollar .DXY hit a four-month low against a basket of major currencies. The euro rose 0.8 percent to $1.4016. Stabilization in Western stock markets reduced demand for the safety of U.S. government debt. Benchmark 10-year note yields rose 0.06 percentage point to 3.26 percent.
