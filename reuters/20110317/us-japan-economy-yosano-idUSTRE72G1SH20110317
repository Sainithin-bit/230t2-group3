 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japanese Economics Minister Kaoru Yosano said on Thursday he expects Group of Seven members to cooperate to avoid the spread of an impact on the global economy of the disaster in Japan stemming from last week's earthquake. 

 He expects Finance minister Yoshihiko Noda to tell his counterparts in a call at 2200 GMT Thursday that Japan's economy remains sound and there is no confusion in its markets or financial system. Urging investors to react calmly, he aid forex trading in Europe on Thursday was speculative and he hoped currencies would reflect Japan's economic fundamentals. "We expect each country of G7 to further enhance cooperation to prevent Japan's disaster from impacting the global economy," Yosano told reporters. (Reporting by Kaori Kaneko)
