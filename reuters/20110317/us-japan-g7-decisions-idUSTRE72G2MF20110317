 LONDON  (Reuters) - Finance ministers of the Group of Seven industrialized nations, due to talk later on Thursday, are not expected to agree firm policy action but will offer solidarity to Japan and review its plight, a G7 source said. 

 Asked if any decisions on concrete measures were expected today such as an intervention on the yen, the G7 source replied: "There is no decision expected today: it's a demonstration of solidarity and a general review of the situation." Financial leaders of the world's richest countries will hold talks via conference call from around 2200 GMT on Thursday on ways to calm global markets roiled by Japan's nuclear plant crisis and concern it will unravel the world economy's fragile recovery. The yen soared to a record high against the dollar on speculation Japan will repatriate billions of dollars in overseas funds to pay for massive reconstruction that is expected to be much costlier than the bill following the Kobe earthquake in 1995. But Economics Minister Kaoru Yosano told Reuters on Thursday that Japanese markets have not become destabilized enough to warrant joint G7 currency intervention or government purchases of shares, stressing that the damage from last week's devastating quake to the country's economy would be limited.
