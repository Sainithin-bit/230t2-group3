 SINGAPORE/TOKYO  (Reuters) - Steelmakers in quake-hit Japan expect a long-elusive spike in domestic demand as the country prepares for the colossal task of rebuilding everything from homes to power plants, but huge capacity will limit imports. 

 Japan's reconstruction efforts mean shipments from Asia's biggest steel exporter last year may be reduced, tightening Asian supply and lifting prices as it opens a void likely to be filled by China, the world's largest steel producer, and South Korea, Japan's biggest customer. Output in Japan, the world's second-biggest steel producer, stood at 109.6 million tonnes in 2010, but it only consumed 60 million tonnes and mostly exported the rest. With total capacity estimated at 132.4 million tonnes at the end of 2010, and with most Japanese steel mills unscathed by last week's devastating quake and tsunami, even a doubling in domestic demand can be met from local supply. "Any expectation that Japan would suddenly import a lot more steel might be overblown," said Patrick Cleary, analyst at CRU in London. "Disruption to capacity might be very significant in the short term, but I think, going forward, Japan is, by and large, going to meet its own requirements." Last Friday's 9.0-magnitude quake and the tsunami that followed it forced some steelmakers to suspend operations but many resumed production by Sunday though state-mandated power outages and damaged ports continue to disrupt production and shipments. Top Japanese steelmaker Nippon Steel Corp, the world's No. 4 producer, has said all plants, except its Kamaishi unit in northern Japan, were back online. The Kamaishi plant, which makes wire rods used in tires and bridges, has a monthly output of 60,000 tonnes. Hardest hit is the main Kashima plant of Japan's No. 3 steelmaker Sumitomo Metal Industries Ltd, the mill closest to the quake's epicenter. Operations at the plant, which makes 8.3 million tonnes of crude steel a year, remain suspended, with two major blast furnaces off, although the company said on Wednesday it had no plan to declare force majeure on coal deliveries. "There hasn't been any real structural damage to most of the mills in Japan, so it looks like they could restart production pretty quickly," said Graeme Train, commodity analyst at Macquarie in Shanghai. "They also generate about 85 percent of their own electricity so they aren't going to be affected by issues like nuclear power." Nippon Steel and Sumitomo Metal last month announced plans to merge to create the world's No. 2 steelmaker. LONG WAY BACK But it will be a long and costly route back to recovery for Japan with a reconstruction bill analysts have said could go up to $180 billion, more than 50 percent higher than the total cost of the 1995 earthquake in Kobe. It is similarly difficult to determine when rebuilding can start as Japan is overwhelmed by a worsening nuclear crisis and taking care of people without food and water. How long the rebuilding will take is another big unknown with many industrial plants located on the coastline where the ground level sank after the tsunami, analysts say. Reconstruction after the Kobe disaster began about two months after that earthquake and lasted for two years. Japan, which last year overtook China as Asia's biggest steel exporter, may have to cut overseas sales once its reconstruction is underway, opening a gap in the Asian supply chain for other producers in China and South Korea. Japan exported a record 43 million tonnes of steel in 2010, according to the Japan Iron and Steel Federation, as the likes of Nippon Steel and global fifth-ranked JFE Steel Corp, which get nearly half of their revenue from exports, sold more abroad amid a shrinking market at home. "Within Asia Pacific, any reduction in Japanese exports by 1 million tonnes per month will be significant to pricing and margins and impact will be larger to countries like South Korea and Taiwan and much smaller to India and China because of the size of their domestic demand," said Colin Liang, analyst at Bank of America-Merrill Lynch. China has excess capacity of more than 100 million tonnes but quality issues may prevent Chinese steelmakers from taking over some of Japan's market share. "Japan has strict quality codes which would make it a bit difficult for the Chinese to export en masse but the better-run Chinese mills could take advantage," said Macquarie's Train. The likes of Baoshan Iron and Steel, China's biggest listed steelmaker, which produce high-end flat products like hot-rolled coil, cold-rolled coil and other sheets and plates, should benefit, he said. "But the Koreans are probably the most obvious beneficiary because they import a lot of steel from Japan," said Train. "It will tighten up the regional market because Japan won't be exporting any excess long products." Japan usually exports thick plates for shipbuilding, semi-finished products like hot coils and slabs and sheet steel for cars and electronic appliances. South Korea's POSCO, the world's No. 3 steelmaker, which counts Nippon Steel and billionaire investor Warren Buffett as major shareholders, has been struggling to pass on rising costs because of weak steel demand. "First, we will see a lot of exports flowing back to the domestic market and on top of that there might be additional imports of construction steel products into Japan," said Liang at Bank of America-Merrill Lynch. IMPORTS MAY RISE BRIEFLY Japan is not a big steel importer with last year's imports only reaching 7.2 million tonnes. The country increased imports of construction steel from China several years ago, but many of them stayed at ports due to quality problems. "I'm sure there is enough steel capacity in Japan, but imports could temporarily rise if mini mills can't operate due to power outages," said a Japanese analyst who declined to be named. The small mills, which produce construction steel using scraps, have a total capacity of about 43 million tonnes, according to recent government estimates. Government-imposed blackouts have forced big steel users like automakers Toyota and Honda to halt operations at all Japanese facilities for days, suggesting steel mills may have to cut back on production prior to the rebuilding. Manufacturing demand accounts for more than 65 percent of Japan's steel consumption, followed by construction. "If the power situation becomes a medium-term issue and power restrictions remain in place then capacity might be taken out, and it may be possible that Japan has to import more," said CRU's Cleary, adding it was difficult to estimate how much imports may rise. A cut in Japan's output should curb demand for raw materials like iron ore and coking coal, helping calm prices that have shot up early this year on tight supply and Australian floods. Spot iron ore prices have already fallen to more than three-month lows. Japan imports about 135 million tonnes of iron ore and around 70 million tonnes of coking coal a year, mostly via long-term contracts with global miners Vale, BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto "There's certainly a threat to raw material prices in the near term and the steel industry will welcome that because the margins in the steel sector have been really squeezed by high production cost," said Cleary. But Nikko Cordial analyst Kazuhiro Harada doubted the output cuts will have a major impact on raw material prices, particularly iron ore, given China's buying power, around five times bigger than Japan. "Japan's purchases are much smaller than China's. I would say the impact will be limited even if Japanese mills cut production."
