 (Reuters) - American Airlines said on Tuesday it took delivery of the first of 14 Boeing ( BA.N ) extended range 777-300 planes it has ordered. 
 The twin-aisle plane, which has more than 300 seats and offers first class, business class and main cabins, will be used on the Dallas/Fort Worth to Sao Paulo route in early 2013. American, a unit of AMR Corp ( AAMRQ.PK ), said the plane would also fly to London Heathrow Airport from Dallas/Fort Worth and New York's John F. Kennedy Airport. American, which is currently operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and weighing a potential merger with US Airways Group ( LCC.N ), said it was the first U.S. airline to order and take delivery of the 777-300ER. The carrier is modernizing its fleet and has more than 550 planes on order. (Reporting by  Karen Jacobs ; Editing by  Tim Dobbyn )
