 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department filed a felony criminal information against HSBC Holdings Plc's HSBC Bank USA in federal court in News York's Brooklyn on Tuesday. 
 The information is a widely expected precursor to a deferred prosecution agreement under which the bank would pay $1.9 billion to resolve money laundering charges. (Reporting By  Aruna Viswanatha ; Editing by Gerald E. McCormick)
