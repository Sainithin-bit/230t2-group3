 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Oil rebounded from a 20-month low on Wednesday as cooler weather in the United States rekindled heating demand, keeping prices above $50 and stemming a slide that had cut 18 percent off prices this month. 

 U.S. crude futures CLc1 settled $1.03 higher at $52.24 a barrel, after slipping as low as $50.28, the lowest level since May 25, 2005. London Brent LCOc1 rose $1.16 to $52.78 a barrel. "I think there is psychological resistance at $50," said Jason Schenker, an economist for Wachovia Bank in Charlotte, North Carolina. "I think the prospect of colder weather may also provide some fundamental footing for heating oil in the near term." Prices had hit fresh 20-month lows for two consecutive sessions after Saudi Arabia said production cuts by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries were working well and an emergency meeting of the producer group was unnecessary. "There is no need to worry because the market is in a very healthy condition," the kingdom's oil minister, Ali al-Naimi, told reporters on Wednesday. The market has plunged more than 35 percent since hitting a record peak of $78.40 a barrel in July 2006 amid escalating Middle East tensions. $50 BARRIER Many technical analysts said it was not a question of if, but when, the market would test the $50 support level. "Most of our charts suggest the prices will continue heading south, perhaps punctuated by the odd bounce," Man Financial said in a research note. "In crude's case, the $50 level should not impede any selling either, as it does not constitute major chart support but, rather, is more of a psychological price point at this stage." As colder weather reached the U.S. Northeast, heating demand was forecast to rise above average early in the week, with Wednesday demand well above usual, private forecaster DTN Meteorlogix said. <ID:nDTN813> But the coming of the cold was a little too late to change radically the recent fundamentals, analysts said. The International Monetary Fund has revised downward its 2007 estimate for global oil prices to $52 a barrel from a September forecast of $75.50, the fund's managing director, Rodrigo Rato, told Reuters on Tuesday. <ID:nWAT006854> Analysts polled by Reuters expected U.S. weekly oil statistics to show a build of 100,000 barrels in crude stocks last week, the first rise in eight weeks, with imports rebounding from a steep drop the previous week. <EIA/S> Distillate stocks were projected to have risen 1.9 million barrels, with gasoline seen rising 2.2 million barrels. The data will be released on Thursday, a day later than usual due to a U.S. holiday on Monday. (Additional reporting by  Fayen Wong  in Sydney and  Randy Fabi  in London)
