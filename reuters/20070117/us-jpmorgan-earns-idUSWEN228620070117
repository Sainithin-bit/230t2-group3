 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co. ( JPM.N ), the third-largest U.S. banking group, said on Wednesday quarterly earnings rose 68 percent, helped by a big surge in investment banking revenue and a $622 million gain from selling its corporate trust unit to Bank of New York. 

 JPMorgan Chief Executive Jamie Dimon also said he's keeping an eye out for potential acquisitions. "I think the hurdle would be kind of high, but we're open for business," Dimon told analysts on a conference call. JPMorgan, which also received a boost from an increase in debt financing deals, reported fourth-quarter net income of $4.5 billion, or $1.26 a share, up from $2.7 billion, or 76 cents a share, in the year-earlier period. Excluding one-time items, the New York-based bank earned $1.09 a share, according to Reuters Estimates, better than the 94-cents-a-share average expectation of analysts. Prudential Equity Group analyst Michael Mayo said JPMorgan's results look like a tale of two banks: Investment banking, private equity and asset management are the force behind record results, while traditional banking is lagging. "The other half of the company is getting dragged down by sluggish growth in traditional banking," Mayo said in a research note. Investment banking revenue surged 48 percent to $4.72 billion, and net income from that activity rose 51 percent to $1 billion. That led to big-ticket pay at the bank, where compensation expense rose to $1.9 billion, compared with the year-ago level of $1.1 billion. Going into 2007, the company's pipeline for mergers and acquisitions looks "pretty strong," Chief Financial Officer Mike Cavanagh said during a conference call with reporters. JPMorgan also saw across-the-board gains in advisory, loan syndication and bond underwriting fees. Those increases drove total net revenue to $16.1 billion, up from $14.8 billion in the year-ago quarter. In contrast, the bank's retail financial services segment disappointed some analysts after the unit's net income fell 11 percent to $718 million. The unit was hurt by a pretax loss of $233 million, triggered by the repositioning of its mortgage loan portfolio, Sandler O'Neill analyst Jeff Harte said in a research note. JPMorgan's various operating segments reported mixed results on credit quality. The provision for credit losses at its retail finance division, which includes home equity and car loans, rose 66 percent to $262 million. In contrast, the bank's credit card unit saw its provision for credit losses fall 43 percent to $1.3 billion because of significantly lower bankruptcy filings, JPMorgan said. Dimon said he expects credit card losses to increase this year, but not dramatically. Despite a cooling trend in housing sales, JPMorgan's mortgage loan originations were up 9 percent from the previous quarter at $31 billion. JPMorgan's asset management business generated a 19 percent gain in net income as assets under supervision rose 17 percent to $1.3 trillion. JPMorgan shares have risen 20 percent in the past year, outperforming the Dow Jones U.S. Banks index .DJUSBK by 8 percentage points. After posting small gains in early trading, the stock fell 14 cents to $48.25 on the New York Stock Exchange.
