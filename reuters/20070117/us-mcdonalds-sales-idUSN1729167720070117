 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - McDonald's Corp. ( MCD.N ) said on Wednesday it expects quarterly earnings above Wall Street estimates due to strong customer demand for the new chicken Snack Wrap and breakfast offerings in the United States and a Monopoly game promotion in Germany. 

 The world's biggest restaurant chain expects to earn 61 cents per share for the fourth quarter -- excluding a gain of 39 cents a share related to the spin-off last year of the Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. ( CMG.N ) business. Analysts, on average, were expecting earnings before one-time items of 58 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. McDonald's also reported a better-than-expected 7.2 percent rise in sales at restaurants open at least 13 months in December. Analysts were expecting a rise of about 4 percent, according to research notes. "McDonald's is doing an excellent job of giving customers more reasons to visit more often," said Morningstar Inc. restaurant analyst John Owens. He noted that in the United States, the new Snack Wrap is leading customers to McDonald's between meals while a stronger coffee blend and other options are boosting its breakfast business. Owens also has the equivalent of a "neutral" rating on the stock, which has jumped almost 35 percent since mid-June. "This is still an excellent business," Owens said. "We just think the share price now fully reflects that." McDonald's shares were up 23 cents at $44.80 Wednesday morning on the New York Stock Exchange. Banc of America Securities analyst Andrew Barish said in a research report that he expects monthly same-store sales to increase about 3 percent going forward "as the company continues to face very difficult comparisons." He has a "buy" rating on the company's stock. McDonald's has been on a hot streak since implementing an aggressive turnaround strategy in 2003 that included adding higher-priced menu items such as salads and chicken sandwiches, extending restaurant hours, and allowing customers to pay for their meals with credit cards. UBS analyst David Palmer said in a note to clients that he expects more modest same-store sales growth of 2.5 percent to 3 percent in 2007. He added, however, that profit margin improvements at company-operated restaurants and a plan to sell unprofitable company-owned stores to franchisees should drive McDonald's stock higher this year. Palmer has a "buy" rating on McDonald's stock. December same-store sales rose 6.9 percent in the United States and climbed 8.2 percent in Europe. In the company's Asia, Middle East and Africa business, same-store sales were up 4.8 percent in part due to strength in Japan and Australia. In Europe, a strong post-holiday shopping season and seasonal menu items in France and Britain contributed to the month's sharp sales increase. The shift in the Christmas holiday to Monday in 2006 from Sunday in 2005 helped sales in some countries, the company said. (Additional reporting by  Brad Dorfman  in Chicago)
