 CHICAGO/BOSTON  (Reuters) - Home builder Lennar Corp. ( LEN.N ) said on Wednesday it swung to a loss in the latest quarter, but said earnings this year might be substantially better than the market expects, sending its shares up as much as 5 percent. 

 For the fourth quarter that ended November 30, Lennar, the third-largest U.S. home builder, reported a net loss of $195.6 million, or $1.24 per share, compared with a year-earlier profit of $581.2 million, or $3.54 per share, as the company struggled with the weak U.S. property market. Analysts polled by Reuters Estimates had expected a loss of $1.11 a share for the quarter. The company said its goal is for 2007 earnings to meet or exceed 2006 profit of $3.69 per share. But Chief Executive Stuart Miller emphasized that Lennar would need to cut costs to make that goal. "Underlying this goal, clearly, is a little bit of Scotch tape and Band-Aids. We simply can't see into the future," Miller said on a conference call with investors. "And this is why we put forth a goal at this point and not guidance as we have in the past." He added, "Market conditions have continued to be very difficult ... we have not yet seen improvement in market conditions to date." Analysts expect the company to report 2007 earnings of $2.65 per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Margaret Whelan, an analyst at UBS, called Lennar's estimate "aggressive" and said she was worried that the company's price-cutting strategy "may be eroding its brand value." Lennar shares were up $1.98, or 4 percent, at $51.70 on the New York Stock Exchange. Earlier, the shares were as high as  $52.26. The unexpectedly upbeat outlook from a company that less than two weeks ago slashed its fourth-quarter outlook came one day after rivals Centex Corp. ( CTX.N ) and KB Home ( KBH.N ) both took charges to reduce their land positions. "We are navigating through one of the most challenging housing environments in the past 25 years," Tim Eller, Centex' chief executive, said in a statement. In recent months, falling prices and rising cancellations have led home builders to cut their forecasts repeatedly as many buyers either walk away from contracts or press for additional incentives before signing. Separately, rival KB Home said it would record noncash charges of $88 million in the fourth quarter for abandoning certain land options contracts and $255 million for inventory impairments.
