 BOSTON  (Reuters) - Mellon Financial Corp. MEL.N on 
Wednesday reported a 14 percent rise in quarterly profits that 
beat Wall Street analysts' expectations, as demand for the 
money management and asset servicing company's fee-based 
businesses grew. 

  Mellon, which will soon combine with former rival Bank of 
New York Co. ( BK.N ) to create the world's biggest securities 
servicing company and one of the largest money managers, said 
net income rose to $237 million, or 57 cents per share, from 
$208 million or 50 cents a share, a year earlier.  This included a net after-tax loss of $61 million due 
primarily to the recent sale of Pittsburgh-based Mellon's 
venture capital business to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. ( GS.N ).  Revenue rose 26 percent to $1.52 billion.  Income from continuing operations rose to $298 million, or 
72 cents a share, from $201 million, or 48 cents a share.  This includes a charge of approximately 10 cents per share 
to pay for severance costs, impairment charges, merger-related 
expenses and occupancy reserves, the company said. It also had 
a gain of 18 cents per share because of a one-time tax benefit.  Wall Street analysts had expected income from continuing 
operations of 58 cents, according to Reuters Estimates.  "Asset management really led the quarter, in part because 
of strong performance fees; but asset servicing was also very 
strong," Mellon Chief Financial Officer Michael Bryson told 
Reuters in an interview, adding: "We have good momentum going 
into 2007."  Assets under management jumped 27 percent to a record $995 
billion, while assets under administration and custody climbed 
15 percent to $4.49 trillion.  Mellon, which runs the Dreyfus funds, said investment 
management fee revenue surged 52 percent to $797 million amid 
stronger asset flows, higher performance fees and the 
acquisition of Walter Scott & Partners, a Scottish asset 
manager Mellon bought in 2006.  Institutional trust and custody fee revenue, including 
securities lending revenue, climbed 14 percent to $244 million.  Founded in 1869 and known for helping finance the growth of 
the U.S. steel industry, Mellon has experienced a turnaround in 
the last months since Bob Kelly took over as CEO and calls from 
a large shareholder to split the company have quieted down.  Indeed rather than divide, Mellon last year made a major 
acquisition in the investment management area and may keep its 
eyes open for additional purchases to enhance its offerings, 
Bryson said. Bryson said Mellon is making good progress toward 
reaching its goal of earning more revenue abroad.  While revenue grew strongly, expenses also expanded 32 
percent to $1.19 billion, the company said, citing higher staff 
expenses, including incentives and severance pay.  Mellon's stock, which closed trading at $43.42 on Tuesday, 
has jumped 23.32 percent in the last year, outperforming its 
benchmark Standard & Poor's 500 index  .SPX  and industry 
rivals, as measured by the S&P Asset Management and Custody 
Banks Index.
