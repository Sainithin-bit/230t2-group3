 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - European Union investigators have 
recommended that Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes formally 
charge Intel Corp. ( INTC.O ) with thwarting competition in the 
computer-chip market, The Wall Street Journal reported on 
Wednesday, citing people familiar with the matter. 

  Kroes must act against Intel or drop the case, the Journal 
reported.  An Intel spokesman was not immediately available for 
comment.
