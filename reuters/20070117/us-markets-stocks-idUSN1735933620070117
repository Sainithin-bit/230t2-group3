 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The Nasdaq finished lower on Wednesday as investors sold U.S. technology shares after disappointing financial results from bellwether Intel Corp. ( INTC.O ), but record results from Apple Inc. ( AAPL.O ) may improve the outlook for the sector. 

 Intel weighed on all three major indexes. But the Dow and the S&P 500 closed only marginally lower as investors snapped up beaten-down energy shares and a brokerage upgrade lifted shares of blue-chip consumer products maker Procter & Gamble Co. ( PG.N ) Intel, the world's largest microchip maker, said late on Tuesday that quarterly profit fell 40 percent and gross margins would not improve. Apple, which last week unveiled its multimedia iPhone device, said it shipped 21.1 million iPods in the quarter and boosted profit by 78 percent. Apple shares initially shot up more than $4 in electronic composite trading after the closing bell. But later on in extended trading, Apple declined after the company gave a forecast that below analysts' targets. "Apple affects a number of other sectors, but now it could be bigger than it used to be when it was a computer company, now that it is Apple Inc.," said Joe Saluzzi, co-manager of trading at Themis Trading in Chatham, New Jersey. "It's become one of the most important earnings reports out there." The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  slipped 5.44 points, or 0.04 percent, to end at 12,577.15. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  dipped 1.28 points, or 0.09 percent, to close at 1,430.62. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  fell 18.36 points, or 0.74 percent, to finish at 2,479.42. Intel shares dropped 5.7 percent, or $1.26, to $21.04, their biggest one-day percentage fall since mid-July. Apple's stock lost 2.2 percent, or $2.15, to end the regular session at $94.95 on the Nasdaq. In after-hours trading, Apple's stock jumped to $99.30 shortly after the record earnings were reported. Later on, after Apple gave a conservative forecast for the current quarter, the stock slipped to $94.11. After Intel, shares of Cisco exerted the second-heaviest downward pull on the Nasdaq. Merrill Lynch downgraded the network equipment maker to "neutral" from "buy." <ID:nWNA3774>. Cisco shares fell 3.8 percent, or $1.06, to $26.98 on the Nasdaq. AN APPETITE FOR EXXON The energy sector, which has taken a hit this month as crude oil prices slid, provided a bright spot for the broader market on Wednesday. Shares of Exxon Mobil Corp. ( XOM.N ) gained 1.2 percent, or 83 cents, to $72.46 on the New York Stock Exchange. Exxon ranked No. 1 among the top advancers in both the Dow and the S&P 500 and helped limit the declines in both indexes. NYMEX February crude CLG7 rose $1.03 to settle at $52.24 a barrel. That price, however, is down sharply from its year-end level when NYMEX crude was more than $61 per barrel. Procter & Gamble gained 1 percent, or 67 cents, to $65.36 after Goldman Sachs raised its rating on the stock to a "buy." SURPRISING STRENGTH IN PPI Economic data on Wednesday showed a stronger-than-expected gain in the Producer Price Index in December and a rise in December industrial production above economists' forecast. The 0.9 percent increase in the Labor Department's overall Producer Price Index weakened the case for the Fed to cut interest rates in the near future, analysts said. <ID:nN16166427> San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank President Janet Yellen said that U.S. interest rates are "within range of the desired setting" but that inflation from a "gangbusters" labor market remains a risk. That point was underscored in the Fed's Beige Book, a report on regional U.S. economic conditions. The Fed said labor markets are tightening and some businesses are having trouble finding skilled workers. <ID:nWAT006858>. Trading was moderate on the NYSE, with about 1.53 billion shares changing hands, below last year's estimated daily average of 1.84 billion, while on Nasdaq, about 2.38 billion shares traded, above last year's daily average of 2.02 billion. Advancing stocks outnumbered declining ones by a ratio of about 9 to 8 on the NYSE, while on the Nasdaq, decliners outnumbered advancers by 4 to 3.
