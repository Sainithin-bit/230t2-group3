 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Oil and gas producer Encore 
Acquisition Co. EAC.N said on Wednesday that it would pay 
$400 million in cash to buy oil and natural gas properties in 
Wyoming from Anadarko Petroleum Corp. ( APC.N ) 

  The properties include the Elk Basin Unit and the 
Gooseberry Unit in Park County, Wyoming.  The transaction is expected to close in March, Encore said.  The properties have total proven reserves of about 20 
million barrels of oil equivalent, which are 97 percent oil and 
90 percent proved developed producing, Encore said.  Encore estimated that the 2 million barrels of oil 
equivalent (BOE) will require about $17 million to develop.  The properties produce about 4,000 net BOE per day with an 
additional 350 net BOE per day of natural gas liquids produced 
by the Elk Basin Gas Plant, Encore said.  The properties have a total proved reserves-to-production 
ratio of about 14 years, the company said.  The proved developed properties will generate about $50 
million in cash flow a year in 2007 and 2008, Encore said.  Encore also said it bought put contracts on about 
two-thirds of the acquisitions proved developed producing 
volumes at $65 per barrel for the rest of 2007 and all of 2008.  Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC served as financial 
adviser to Encore. Anadarko's financial adviser was Lehman 
Brothers.  Encore in a separate statement said it would form a master 
limited partnership to hold an initial public offering of 
common units representing limited partner interests.  The partnership is expected to own the Wyoming properties. 
Encore expects to use the net proceeds from the IPO to pay down 
debt in connection with the acquisition.
