 DETROIT  (Reuters) - General Motors Corp.'s ( GM.N ) global 
sales declined by less than 1 percent in 2006 as strong growth 
in Asia largely offset a slump in the U.S. auto market, the 
world's biggest automaker said on Wednesday. 

  GM sold 9.09 million cars and trucks worldwide last year, 
with 55 percent of the total sold outside the United States, 
the company said.  GM's sales in the United States, still the largest market 
for cars and trucks, dropped almost 9 percent to nearly 4.1 
million vehicles, according to previously released sales data.  GM executives and Wall Street analysts have attributed the 
company's U.S. sales losses to a decision to scale back on 
unprofitable sales to car rental companies and an industrywide 
slump linked to higher interest rates and volatile fuel prices.  GM, which has cut 34,000 jobs from its U.S. factory work 
force, is slashing costs in North America in a bid to return 
its major hub of operations to profitability. It is targeting 
faster growth in developing markets like China.  In a statement on Wednesday, GM said its sales outside the 
United States rose almost 7 percent last year to 4.9 million 
vehicles. Much of that growth came from China, where sales 
jumped 32 percent.  GM, which has a joint venture for car production in China 
with Shanghai Automotive Co. ( 600104.SS ), said that for the 
first time it sold more Buicks in China than in the United 
States last year -- 304,000 vs. 241,000.  With industrywide global sales estimated at over 67 million 
vehicles in 2006, GM had a market share of about 14 percent, 
compared with its share of about 25 percent of the U.S. market 
for cars and light trucks.  Japan's Toyota Motor Corp. ( 7203.T ) last month said it 
expects to produce 9.42 million vehicles in 2007, a number that 
could allow it to supplant GM as the world's largest automaker.  Toyota's U.S. sales grew almost 13 percent in 2006, even as 
industrywide sales dropped by about 3 percent.
