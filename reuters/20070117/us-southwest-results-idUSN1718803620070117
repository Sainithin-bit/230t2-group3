 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Southwest Airlines Co. ( LUV.N ), the leading U.S. discount carrier, on Wednesday posted a 19 percent decline in fourth-quarter earnings, hurt by higher jet fuel costs. 

 Fuel prices rose from the year earlier quarter. While the airline was one of the few U.S. airlines to lock in low fuel prices with long-term hedging contracts, those hedges were not as profitable as they were a year ago. Net profit fell to $57 million, or 7 cents a share, from $70 million, or 9 cents a share, in the same period last year. Earnings were burdened by a 28 percent rise, on average, in its fuel costs and higher charges as it marked down the value of its fuel hedges. Still, Southwest's fuel-hedging program yielded a gain of $118 million in the quarter, continuing to underpin the No. 6 U.S. carrier's profits. But that gain was less than half what it was last year. Excluding charges for revaluing its hedging position and other items, earnings rose to 12 cents per share from 10 cents, in line with analyst expectations. Southwest's hedges allowed the airline to undercut competitors' fares and still make money. But its hedges are gradually unwinding and provide less protection than they did in the past as the price of oil declines and the price at which it is hedged rises. The budget carrier has responded by raising prices. Southwest said it was 95 percent hedged for the remainder of 2007 at an oil price of about $50 per barrel. After a recent decline, crude oil CLc1 is currently trading only slightly above that at $50.80. "Southwest would like lower fuel prices, even if it costs them on the hedges," said Ray Neidl, an analyst with Calyon Securities. "It saves them money and puts more money in the pockets of consumers, which are the people that fly on Southwest." The earnings come amid a background of merger frenzy among traditional airlines. US Airways Group Inc. ( LCC.N ) has made hostile bid for larger, bankrupt rival Delta Air Lines Inc. DALRQ.PK. Analysts and industry observers expect the deal to spark other mergers if it succeeds. Southwest, which plans to increase its fleet by 8 percent with the addition of 37 aircraft in 2007, said it is well-positioned either way. "We have significant growth opportunities with or without consolidation," Southwest Chief Executive Gary Kelly said in a statement. He said the company is "hopeful" it can exceed its target of 15 percent growth in earnings before special items this year and expects revenue growth in the first quarter to "remain steady." Southwest isn't expected to be a partner in any merger, but has said it would be interested in bidding on gates, planes or routes spun off as a result of any deals. Operating revenue rose 14.5 percent to $2.3 billion in the fourth quarter, as Southwest, the largest carrier by market value, raised fares and increased capacity by 10 percent. Southwest's shares, which has underperformed peers over the last six months, fell 2.8 percent to $16.10 in early trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
