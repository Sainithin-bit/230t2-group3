 PARIS  (Reuters) - Airbus ( EAD.PA ) lost the annual battle 
for plane orders to Boeing Co. ( BA.N ) for the first time in six 
years on Wednesday, posting 790 net orders for 2006 versus its 
rival's 1,044. 

  Airbus said it had stayed ahead of the U.S. firm in planes 
delivered, with 434 aircraft versus 398 deliveries by Boeing.  Louis Gallois, co-Chief Executive of parent firm EADS and 
head of Airbus, said Airbus expected to deliver 440 to 450 
planes this year.  He also announced that Airbus had formally approved plans 
to build a new freight version of its A330-200 airliner.  Gallois underscored that 2006 was a record year for Airbus 
deliveries and Airbus's second-best outing in orders. However 
he acknowledged that Airbus had been hurt by surging sales of 
Boeing's 787 model due in 2008.  He also said the value of Airbus's orders -- which 
increasingly rely on smaller, less expensive models -- had 
slipped to 40 percent of the market based on list prices for 
824 gross orders. Boeing's gross tally was 1,050.  Airbus had 2006 revenues of approximately 26 billion euros 
($33.61 billion), Gallois told a news conference.  EAD's shares fell 4 percent to 24.71 euros at 1041 GMT.  (Writing by  Jason Neely )
