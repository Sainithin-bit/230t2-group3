 STOCKHOLM  (Reuters) - Japanese-Swedish mobile phone venture 
Sony Ericsson beat expectations with record fourth-quarter 
earnings and said it was optimistic about raising its world 
market share to third largest from fourth. 

  Owned by Sweden's Ericsson ( ERICb.ST ) and Japan's Sony 
Corp. ( 6758.T ), the handset maker said on Wednesday it had been 
buoyed by further success in its music and camera phones and 
raised its forecast for 2006 total industry handset sales.  "The fourth quarter saw Sony Ericsson finish a strong year 
with record volumes, sales and net income due to the soaring 
popularity of our imaging and music phones," company President 
Miles Flint said in a statement.  Pretax profit rose to 502 million euros ($648.9 million), 
exceeding the average forecast of 428 million in a Reuters poll 
and its 206 million in the same period of 2005.  The figure was a record high, as were net earnings of 447 
million euros, up from 144 million in the same period of 2005.  Ericsson shares were up 1.7 percent to 29.85 euros at 0817 
GMT, while Sony shares had closed down 0.53 percent in Tokyo.  "Sony Ericsson increased market share during the quarter 
due to the continued success of products such as the K800/K790 
Cyber-shot phone and Walkman phone line-up," it added.  It raised its 2006 estimate for industry handset sales to 
980 million units from a previous forecast of 950 million.  "Our target is to become one of the top three players in 
the industry, and the momentum we established in 2006 makes 
this an achievable ambition," Flint added.  The company said it believed it had outperformed the market 
in the fourth quarter, gaining around 1 percent of market share 
sequentially for a global position of about 9 percent.  "In Q4 2006 Sony Ericsson grew market share slightly over 2 
percent against the same period for the previous year," it 
said.  (additional reporting by Tarmo Virki in Helsinki)
