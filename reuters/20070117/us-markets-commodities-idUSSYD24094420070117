 LONDON  (Reuters) - The exit from commodities that has wiped more than a tenth from the price of oil and copper since the start of the year showed no sign of stopping on Wednesday. 

 U.S. crude CLc1 was at $51.17 per barrel at 6:03 a.m. ET, down 4 cents from its previous close and more than 15 percent lower since the start of the year. On Tuesday, it hit its cheapest in 20 months on comments from number one exporter Saudi Arabia that there was no need for an emergency meeting of producer group OPEC to discuss the steep fall in prices. That fall is due in part to warm weather in the north-east of the United States, the world's top heating oil market. "The market is quite nervous about taking positions after seeing so many days of sharp drops in oil prices. Many are getting out of the market and cutting their losses," Mitsui Bussan Futures analyst Tetsu Emori said. Benchmark copper futures at the London Metal Exchange MCU3 were quoted at $5,600/5,5620 per ton at 1104 GMT. At this level, copper was down almost 12 percent since the start of the year, while gold XAU= at $622.60/623.360 per ounce was down 2 percent. The severity of the depreciation across assets is worrying investors, and as they lose their appetite for risk in an environment of rising interest rates and slowing global economic growth, commodities may be falling out of favor. SEEN LESS ATTRACTIVE "Increased volatility and the recent short term setback will make the asset class less attractive for most investors," Jonathan Bell, chief investment officer at Stanhope Capital, said in his outlook for 2007. HSBC analyst James Steel said prices may have peaked, and investors may be turning away from high-risk investments in general rather than commodities exclusively. "In our view, the investor interest that (oil and copper) attracted now appears to be deserting the markets," he said. "Emerging markets have also lost some ground recently, and we believe their fate has been tied to gold and commodities for the last 18 months or so. It is also possible that the enthusiasm for risky investments may be waning." A commodities fund manager saw choppy waters ahead. "The one thing that's certain is volatility," he said. "I can't see copper getting near $9,000 as it did last year, but as long as the pension funds keep coming in there is upside." While more risk-friendly investors have put money into fast-moving hedge funds that can make money whether prices rise or fall, conservative pension funds have bought commodities to balance their portfolios rather than to profit from short-term moves. They buy the asset via indices which hold commodities regardless of market direction -- and which have been hit hard by the recent moves. The energy-heavy Goldman Sachs Total Returns Index .GTX had lost almost 10 percent since the start of the year by the close of trading on Tuesday. Shares with strong links to commodities have also had a rough start to 2007. As of mid-morning in London, natural resources heavyweights Royal Dutch Shell ( RDSb.L ) and Anglo American ( AAL.L ) were respectively down 5 and 6 percent since the start of year, in contrast to a FTSE index  .FTSE  down less than 1 percent.
