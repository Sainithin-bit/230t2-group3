 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. technology stocks sagged on Wednesday after disappointing financial results from bellwether Intel Corp. ( INTC.O ) and a brokerage downgrade of Cisco Systems Inc. ( CSCO.O ) 

 The Dow and S&P 500 managed to stay near the unchanged level as investors snapped up beaten-down energy shares and a brokerage upgrade lifted shares of blue-chip consumer products maker Procter & Gamble Co. ( PG.N ) Shares of Intel were the biggest drag on the three major indexes after the world's largest microchip maker said late on Tuesday that quarterly profit fell 40 percent and gross margins would not improve. In other earnings news, investors will watch for Apple Inc.'s ( AAPL.O ) results after Wednesday's closing bell. "This will probably be the last quarter you get double- digit earnings growth," said Malcolm Polley, president of Stewart Capital Advisors in Indiana, Pennsylvania, whose firm owns Intel shares. "What you continue to see in tech is collapsing prices and margins worsening ... Intel beat their numbers, but they warned last night." After Intel, shares of Cisco exerted the second-heaviest pull on Nasdaq. Merrill Lynch downgraded the network equipment maker to "neutral" from "buy." <ID:nWNA3774>. Cisco shares fell 3.8 percent to $26.98 on the Nasdaq. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  was down 18.58 points, or 0.15 percent, at 12,564.01. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  was down 2.77 points, or 0.19 percent, at 1,428.69. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  was down 20.16 points, or 0.81 percent, at 2,477.62. Intel shares dropped 6.6 percent to $20.83 and were on track for their biggest one-day percentage fall since mid-July. Apple's stock was down 1.6 percent at $95.55. Shares of Exxon Mobil Corp. ( XOM.N ) gained almost 1 percent to $72.30. NYMEX February crude CLG7 rose $1.03 to settle at $52.24 a barrel. That price, however, is down sharply from its year-end level when NYMEX crude was more than $61 per barrel. Procter & Gamble gained 1.4 percent to $65.60 after Goldman Sachs raised its rating on the stock to a "buy." Economic data on Wednesday showed stronger-than-expected producer price inflation in December and a rise in industrial production above economists' forecast. The 0.9 percent rise in the Labor Department's Producer Price Index weakened the case for the Fed to cut interest rates in the near future, analysts said. <ID:nN16166427> San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank President Janet Yellen said that U.S. interest rates are "within rage of the desired setting" but that inflation from a "gangbusters" labor market remains a risk. That point was underscored in the Fed's Beige Book, a report on regional U.S. economic conditions. The Fed said labor markets are tightening and some businesses are having trouble finding skilled workers <ID:nWAT006858>.
