 BRIDGEPORT, Connecticut  (Reuters) - Former Cendant Corp. Chairman Walter Forbes was sentenced on Wednesday to 12 years and seven months in prison and ordered to pay $3.3 billion for one of corporate Americas's biggest accounting scandals. 

 Prosecutors said Forbes and former Vice Chairman Kirk Shelton oversaw a massive accounting scheme that overstated income at Cendant, a travel and real estate company now known as Avis Budget Group Inc. CAR.N, and at predecessor company CUC International Inc. U.S. District Judge Alan Nevas in Bridgeport, Connecticut called the restitution "a reasonable estimate of the victims' losses" but he did not say how Forbes would be expected to pay such a large sum. Forbes, 64, was convicted in October on one count of conspiracy and two counts of false reporting after two previous mistrials for his role in the accounting irregularities. Cendant's stock market value sank about $14 billion in one day after the fraud was disclosed in 1998. It was one of a series of accounting scandals that rocked Corporate America, and led to a settlement with investors worth $2.85 billion. When the judge handed down the sentence, Forbes sat hunched forward, expressionless. He did not comment at the hearing. He was given a harsher punishment than Shelton, who was sentenced to 10 years in prison in August 2005 for his role in the fraud. Shelton also was ordered to pay $3.3 billion in restitution. Under federal sentencing guidelines, Forbes faced as much as 15 years in prison. His lawyers had asked for a sentence of no more than 10 years, citing his "long history of good conduct" and his age. But the judge said that Forbes' $2.5 million in charitable giving over a period of years was only "modest" for someone with net worth of about $200 million in late 1997. U.S. Attorney Christopher Christie in New Jersey, whose office prosecuted the case, called Forbes' sentence "justified and appropriate given the havoc he wreaked on the company and its shareholders." "Like similarly long sentences imposed on other corporate figures, it sends the correct message that everyone in our society should be held accountable for criminal conduct," Christie said in a statement. Christie said his office planned to move quickly to recover any assets available from Forbes. Forbes remains free on bail. His attorneys have filed a motion for bail pending appeal, but the U.S. Attorney's Office said it would oppose the motion and seek to have the court set a date for Forbes to report to prison. Cendant was based in New York, but the trial took place in Connecticut because CUC was based in Stamford at the time of the fraud. CUC merged with Parsippany, New Jersey-based HFS Inc. to create Cendant in December 1997.
