 TOKYO  (Reuters) - The head of Japanese Internet and telecoms conglomerate Softbank Corp. declined comment on Wednesday on speculation it will sell Apple Inc.'s iPhone in Japan. 

 The iPhone unveiled by the U.S. consumer electronics giant last week lacks technology that would connect to Japan's wireless networks, and it would need a local partner to help develop a model to operate on a different standard. The popular BlackBerry wasn't available in Japan until last year when its maker Research In Motion allied with the country's top operator NTT DoCoMo Inc. Simply bringing the iPhone made by AT&T Inc.'s Cingular Wireless in the United States to Japan "wouldn't work because the telecommunication system is different," Softbank Chief Executive Masayoshi Son told a group of reporters after a meeting in Tokyo. Last week, shares in Softbank rose on speculation it would be the most likely local operator for iPhone, a much anticipated wireless device equipped with the popular iPod digital music player. Softbank had declined to comment on talks with Apple. A company source told Reuters earlier this week that Son, who is said to be a good friend of Apple CEO Steve Jobs, attended the Macworld expo held in San Francisco last week at which the iPhone was unveiled. The debut of the iPhone -- an ultra-slim $499-$599 device with a touch screen -- sent Apple shares to a record high last week and stole the spotlight from Microsoft Corp. and Sony Corp. at the annual Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. Softbank is hoping for hit models after it slashed prices and launched ads featuring Hollywood stars to lure users at its mobile phone unit, the smallest of the three operators in Japan, which it bought for about 2 trillion yen ($16.6 billion) from Britain's Vodafone Group Plc last year. Son, the billionaire founder of Softbank, also said the company plans to unveil new mobile phone models this month to challenge ultra-thin handsets capable of showing digital TV that are being offered by bigger rivals. He did not specify if the lineup would include the iPhone. Analysts have speculated that iPhones may be the next step for Softbank after the Japanese company last year began selling some of its handsets packaged together with Apple's iPod nano and shuffle players. Still, some industry commentators have said iPhones may have a limited impact in Japan, where music-capable phones are already very popular. Many existing models hook up to high-speed networks and allow direct downloading of entire songs in a few minutes. Softbank plans to unveil new handsets on January 25, more than a week after DoCoMo and KDDI Corp. presented their latest lineup for the spring, which includes the peak month of March, the end of the financial and academic year in Japan. "We're preparing many models that are lots of fun," Son said without elaborating. Shares of Softbank closed flat at 2,460 yen in Tokyo, compared with a 0.34 percent gain in the Nikkei average
