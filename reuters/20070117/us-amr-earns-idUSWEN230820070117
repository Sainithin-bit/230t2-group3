 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - AMR Corp. AMR.N, parent of No. 1 U.S. carrier American Airlines, and Southwest Airlines ( LUV.N ), the leading discount carrier, posted quarterly profits on Wednesday, helped by higher ticket prices and full planes. 

 AMR reversed a year-ago quarterly loss and recorded its first profitable year since 2000, as lower capacity and surging demand for air travel finally allowed most carriers to raise prices, helping them out of the slump they suffered since the attacks of September 11, 2001. Southwest notched its 34th straight annual profit, but the pioneer of low-cost air travel reported a slight decline in quarterly profit because of its higher fuel costs. The carrier, whose fuel hedges have long been the envy of the airline industry, paid more for fuel than it did a year ago because some of its 2006 hedges were less profitable. AMR, which has been less aggressive in hedging, paid less for fuel in the quarter than it did the year before. "A lot of that has to do with Southwest's very strong hedge position, which began to diminish in 2006," said Bill Warlick, an analyst at Fitch Ratings. "In a low energy market environment, their (Southwest's) cost advantage is less compelling. AMR, which was much less hedged, was really benefiting from the year-ago change in spot prices." Shares of AMR briefly hit their highest level in six years, then later slid into negative territory. Southwest shares dipped 2.8 percent. The Amex airline index  .XAL  has risen 18 percent over the past three months, driven by airlines' improving fortunes and merger speculation, hitting a three-year high on Tuesday. FUEL COSTS MIXED Jet fuel JET-USG, which vies with labor as airlines' greatest cost, averaged about $1.77 per gallon in the fourth quarter, compared with about $1.97 a year ago. Southwest paid $1.56 per gallon for jet fuel, 28 percent more than last year because of its worsening hedging position. Meanwhile, AMR paid $1.88 per gallon, 8 percent less than the previous year as it benefited from lower market rates, saving $120 million in fuel expenses. Addressing future hedges -- which are generally pegged to the price of a barrel of crude oil -- AMR said it capped 15 percent of its anticipated 2007 fuel consumption at $67 a barrel, and capped 29 percent of its first-quarter fuel consumption at $66 a barrel. Southwest said it had capped its first quarter fuel needs at about $50 per barrel, but it said it could pay lower market rates if the price of oil falls below that level. Last year Southwest was hedged at around $36 a barrel for most of its fuel needs. Crude CLc1 was trading at $52.23 on Wednesday. PLANES FULL Both airlines boasted record load factors -- the percentage of seats filled by paying passengers -- for the fourth quarter. AMR said its load factor was 78.8 percent, while Southwest's load factor was 70.2 percent. The airline industry, battered in recent years by low-fare competition and rising costs, managed to initiate several lasting fare hikes recently. AMR said its fares were 4 percent higher in the quarter than they were a year earlier. Southwest said its fares rose 4.2 percent, but the company's chief executive warned the industry cannot count on further price increases. "I'm still very cautious about the economy and the reliance on fare increases," Gary Kelly said on a call with analysts and reporters. "We'd be foolish to get addicted to fare increases." AMR and Southwest are the first two U.S. airlines to post their 2006 fourth-quarter results. Their profits may be a good sign for other airlines that have yet to report. AMERICAN SWINGS TO PROFIT AMR said fourth-quarter profit amounted to $17 million, or 7 cents per share, compared with a loss of $600 million, or $3.46 per share, a year earlier. Analysts had expected AMR to lose 8 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. The company's revenue was $5.4 billion, up from $5.2 billion a year earlier. Analysts were expecting $5.45 billion. AMR, which had a 2006 cost savings target of $700 million, set a 2007 savings target of $300 million, said Chief Financial Officer Tom Horton on a call with analysts and reporters. He also said the carrier plans to cut capacity -- the number of seats for sale -- by 1 percent in 2007. Capacity reduction often facilitates fare increases. Southwest's net profit fell to $57 million, or 7 cents a share, from $70 million, or 9 cents a share, in the same period last year. Excluding charges for revaluing its hedging position and other items, earnings rose to 12 cents per share from 10 cents, in line with analyst expectations. AMR shares fell $1.15, or 2.9 percent, to $39.06 on the New York Stock Exchange in afternoon trading, after hitting their highest level since January 2001. Southwest shares were down 51 cents, or 3 percent at $16.06.
