 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Embattled U.S. shopping mall owner Mills Corp. MLS.N said on Wednesday it agreed to be bought by Canada-based Brookfield Asset Management Inc. ( BAMa.TO ) for $21 per share in cash. 

 Mills shares closed at $17.77 on Tuesday and rose about 25.5 percent to $22.31 on Wednesday after the agreement with Brookfield was announced. Analysts said other offers could emerge for the real estate investment trust (REIT). Mills said the Brookfield transaction has a value of $1.35 billion for all common stock of Mills and Mills Limited Partnership. Including assumed debt and preferred stock, the value is $7.5 billion, it said. Mills, based in Chevy Chase, Maryland, has lost about half its stock market value during the past year and had been considering its options amid a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission investigation into its accounting methods. Two major shareholders had recently proposed recapitalization plans for Mills, which last week said it might have to seek bankruptcy protection and faced a March 31 deadline to repay a $1.1 billion loan from Goldman Sachs Group  ( GS.N ). "We were surprised at the timing of this announcement," said Akash Dave, an analyst at Morningstar. "We thought there'd be some announcement of their strategic intentions after filing (their) financials and clearing up the uncertainty surrounding Mills." Another analyst, Rossa O'Reilly of CIBC World Markets, said: "I expect strong competing interests ... whether it takes the form of a bid I don't know." Brookfield Asset Management manages assets of about $50 billion. It owns half of Brookfield Properties Corp. ( BPO.TO ), which has a real estate portfolio of 73 million square feet that includes the World Financial Center in New York. FINANCING Brookfield agreed to provide Mills with debt financing until completion of the merger and to assume Mills' $1 billion senior term loan from Goldman Sachs Mortgage Co. Brookfield will also provide a $500 million revolving line of credit. The transaction is subject to approval by Mills stockholders and is expected to close in the second half of 2007. "After a very competitive process, in which our board considered numerous alternatives for the company, we believe we have achieved an outcome that is the best possible result for all involved," said Mark Ordan, chief executive officer of Mills. Earlier on Wednesday, Israeli real estate investment firm Gazit-Globe Ltd. GLOB.TA, a major Mills shareholder, made a final recapitalization proposal for the REIT valued at up to $1.1 billion. On Tuesday, Mills said another shareholder, San Francisco- based hedge fund Farallon Capital Management offered to recapitalize the company with $499 million. In the Brookfield agreement, Mills common stockholders will receive $21 per share in cash, but can elect instead to receive up to a maximum of 20 percent of the shares of a continuing public company managed by Brookfield. The stock alternative will be subject to proration if holders of more than 20 percent of Mills shares elect to receive stock. If less than 10 percent of Mills shareholders elect the stock rollover, all Mills shares will be exchanged for cash. Preferred stockholders of Mills will receive preferred stock with "substantially the same terms." J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. and Goldman, Sachs & Co. advised Mills. Credit Suisse and Brookfield Financial Real Estate Group advised Brookfield. (Additional reporting by Nick Zieminski, Frank Pingue and  Ben Klayman )
