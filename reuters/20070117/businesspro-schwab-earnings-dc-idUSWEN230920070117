 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Discount stockbroker Charles Schwab 
Corp. SCHW.O on Wednesday said quarterly earnings more than 
doubled over the previous year. 

  San Francisco-based Schwab reported net income of $467 
million, or 37 cents a share, up from $187 million, or 14 cents 
a share, a year earlier.  Net revenue for the quarter rose 14 percent to $1.1 
billion.  Schwab shares slipped 21 cents, or about 1 percent, to 
$19.97 in morning trading.  Results include a $205 million noncash tax benefit relating 
to the $3.3 billion sale announced in November of wealth 
management unit U.S. Trust to Bank of America Corp. ( BAC.N ), 
the company said.  Earnings for the quarter were 21 cents per share excluding 
the tax benefit, matching expectations of polled analysts, 
according to Reuters Estimates.  "Economic drivers for the quarter looked pretty good," 
Keefe, Bruyette & Woods analyst Richard Herr said. "Asset 
growth was strong, but the majority of growth was driven by 
market gains."  Reclassifying earnings to reflect the pending U.S. Trust 
sale also made it difficult to compare the company's earnings 
with prior estimates, Herr added.  Schwab's annual net income was up 69 percent to a record 
$1.2 billion, compared with $725 million in 2005.  Annual revenue was up 19 percent, at $4.3 billion.  Total client assets rose 18 percent in 2006 to $1.2 
trillion at year's end.
