 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Washington Mutual Inc. ( WM.N ), the largest U.S. savings and loan, said on Wednesday fourth-quarter profit rose 22 percent, as a gain from the sale of a mutual fund unit offset a loss in its mortgage business and weakened credit quality. 

 The Seattle-based thrift, which is also the No. 3 U.S. mortgage lender, is the latest company to report difficulties in home lending as borrowing demand softens, profit margins narrow and delinquencies increase. "We saw a continuation of difficult market conditions, with particular challenges in the subprime sector," Chief Executive Kerry Killinger said in an interview. "You had a combination of a housing market slowing, overcapacity, credit deteriorating, relatively low gain-on-sale margins, and an increase in repurchased loans." Net income rose to $1.06 billion, or $1.10 per share, from $865 million, or 85 cents, a year earlier. Results included a $415 million after-tax gain from the sale of its WM Advisors Inc. asset management unit to Principal Financial Group Inc. ( PFG.N ), offset by $100 million of charges for cost-saving initiatives. Excluding items, profit totaled 77 cents per share according to Reuters Estimates, 11 cents below what analysts on average expected. WaMu, as the thrift calls itself, eliminated 1,232 jobs from October to December, and 10,974 jobs, or 18 percent of its workforce, in 2006. It ended the year with 49,824 employees. Many cuts were in its home loans unit, which posted a $122 million quarterly loss. For all of 2006, that unit lost $48 million, compared with a $1.03 billion profit in 2005. "Major efficiency initiatives we wanted to get done, we did get done in 2006," Killinger said. "Moving forward, employment will match changes we'll do in driving productivity improvements, and expanding," including adding 150 branches in 2007. Washington Mutual shares closed Wednesday down 33 cents at $43.73 on the New York Stock Exchange. They fell another 48 cents in after-hours electronic trading. The thrift released results after U.S. markets closed. CREDIT LOSSES RISE WaMu set $344 million for loan and lease losses, twice as much as in the third quarter, with credit cards accounting for more than half of the increase. It also expects to set aside $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion for credit losses in 2007, up from a prior $850 million to $950 million forecast. WaMu attributed much of the increase to an accounting change and the "difficult credit environment." In contrast with the mortgage business, WaMu's three other operating units fared better, though profit fell at two. Retail banking profit dipped 2 percent to $544 million, despite the net additions in 2006 of 1.23 million checking accounts and 144 branches. Credit card profit fell 13 percent to $149 million, and commercial banking profit rose 4 percent to $140 million. "The crown jewel of this company is the retail bank, and it continued to have very strong growth," Killinger said. "(Home loans) is my smallest business now, so I'm glad I have the diversification."
