 ZURICH  (Reuters) - Senior executives at Swiss bank UBS ( UBSN.VX ) were aware in 2006 of a whistleblower's complaints into cross-border services provided to U.S. clients, long before a U.S. probe began, a letter from the bank's chairman shows. 

 A UBS spokesman confirmed a report in the Financial Times on Wednesday that Peter Kurer, UBS chairman and then the bank's general counsel, had written to the whistleblower in May 2006 to thank him for raising attention to the issue. "The letter confirmed that an investigation into the complaints had been completed, the results would be reviewed and recommendations formulated," the spokesman said. The whistleblower was Bradley Birkenfeld, a former UBS banker at the centre of U.S. inquiries into whether the bank helped wealthy American clients evade taxes by moving their money to European tax havens. Kurer wrote to Birkenfeld after he complained about working practices in the U.S. cross-border business. "Management was copied on this letter to further demonstrate the seriousness with which the complaints were being treated," the spokesman said. The FT said the letter was copied to Marcel Rohner, then head of private banking and now group chief executive, as well as Lawrence Weinbach, a UBS director who sits on the board's audit committee. UBS declined to comment on those names. In May, the U.S. Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission revealed they were investigating UBS's conduct in relation to cross-border services provided by UBS advisers to U.S. clients from 2000 to 2007. UBS shares were down 4.3 percent at 21.64 francs at 0917 GMT compared to a 3 percent weaker European banking index .SX7P. Traders said UBS, like other European banking stocks was tracking losses by their U.S. peers overnight on rekindled worries over credit losses, rather than reacting to the letter. The stock lost 2.4 percent on Tuesday after UBS, Europe's biggest casualty of the credit crunch, announced rich clients continued to withdraw money in the second quarter and said it will separate its investment bank from wealth management. The letter was now in the hands of the U.S. Department of Justice, the FT said. UBS declined to comment on that. Birkenfeld, who admitted this year to helping a billionaire U.S. businessman evade millions in tax while at UBS, has been co-operating with the authorities, the paper added.
