 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Clothing and accessories maker Liz Claiborne Inc LIZ.N reported better-than-expected adjusted earnings on Wednesday, helped by cost-cutting and strong sales at Juicy Couture, but narrowed the range of its full-year outlook due to economic uncertainty. 

 On a net basis, the owner of the Juicy Couture, Mexx, Kate Spade and Lucky Brand chains reported a loss of $23.2 million, or 25 cents per share, for the second quarter ended July 5, compared with a net profit of $13.6 million, or 13 cents per share, a year ago. Adjusted earnings from continuing operations were 9 cents per share, said the company, which also owns department store-based brands like Liz Claiborne, Enyce and Narciso Rodriguez. Analysts on average had been expecting earnings of nil per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Net sales fell to $973.8 million from $1.05 billion a year earlier. The company expects 2008 earnings per share in the range of $1.40 to $1.50 per share, compared to its prior range of $1.40 to $1.60 per share. For the third quarter, the company forecast adjusted earnings of 37 cents to 42 cents per share. (Reporting by  Martinne Geller , editing by Gerald E. McCormick and  Derek Caney )
