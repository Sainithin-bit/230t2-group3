 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Deere & Co ( DE.N ), the world's largest maker of farm machinery, reported disappointing quarterly results and warned that soaring raw materials prices would pressure profit margins for the current period, sending shares down as much as 12 percent. 

 Sky-high steel prices, driven by demand from India, China and the Gulf states of the Middle East, hurt earnings in each of its equipment divisions. Rising freight costs also ate into profits. Deere, seeing no change in the near term, warned escalating costs would have an impact on margins in the current quarter. That forecast overshadowed sharply higher revenue and profit in its farm segment in the quarter ended June 30 and a 17 percent rise in total revenue. "Farmers are buying tractors -- period," said Brian Langenberg, principal of research and asset management company Langenberg and Co., who follows industrial names. "That's going great. (But) relative to other industrial companies that buy a lot of steel, they are clearly lagging in terms of their ability to capture price." Net profit rose 7 percent to $575.2 million, or $1.32 a share, in Deere's fiscal third quarter, as soaring crop prices boosted global demand for agricultural equipment. A year earlier Deere earned $537.2 million, or $1.18 a share. Analysts on average expected Deere to earn $1.36 per share. "Results and guidance may disappoint the market somewhat but are not a huge surprise given materials costs that have spiked since Deere's May 14 guidance," Morgan Stanley analyst Robert Wertheimer said in a research note. A higher-than-expected tax rate accounted for much of the earnings miss, Citigroup Global Markets analyst David Raso said, adding that strong results from rivals CNH Global NV CNH.N and Agco Corp ( AG.N ) last month "set the bar a little higher for Deere." Total revenue rose 17 percent to $7.74 billion, while equipment sales were $7.07 billion, short of the $7.17 billion forecast by Wall Street, according to Reuters Estimates. Strong results at its farm segment were somewhat offset by lower sales and profits in its commercial and consumer, and construction and forestry businesses. Worst-hit are divisions dependent on the U.S. consumer, Langenberg said, since a weak U.S. housing market and high gasoline prices are crimping budgets for items like lawn mowers, while retailers resist price increases. "You can't just go back to Home Depot and say, "'Steel went up so we're raising prices,'" Langenberg said. FORECAST FALLS SHORT Deere estimated fourth-quarter net income of $425 million and said its equipment sales would rise about 29 percent in the quarter. Citigroup's Raso said Deere's fourth-quarter profit forecast was equal to about $1 per share, below Wall Street estimates of $1.14 per share, with input costs "sounding like a major element." The pressure from higher costs comes as Deere and its rivals enjoy record demand for their products, thanks to the surge in investment in biofuels and increased consumption in the developing world. Higher farm incomes have translated into sharply higher sales of tractors and combines. On Tuesday, the U.S. Agriculture Department said U.S. farmers will reap a near-record corn crop this autumn, despite spring floods that raised fears of shortages. But higher output could translate into lower commodity prices and, in turn, weaker equipment demand in 2009. Deere shares fell $7.29 to $62.11 on the New York Stock Exchange to their lowest level in a year. With Wednesday's decline, Deere shares have erased all of their gains over the past year, and have lost almost a third of their value since reaching a record high in mid April, lagging other industrial stocks. The stock trades at about 11.3 times next year's estimated earnings, a slight discount to Agco but at a premium to a wider measure of machinery stocks, the S&P Machinery index .GSPMAC.
