 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Soft drink maker Dr Pepper Snapple Group Inc ( DPS.N ) reported better-than-expected quarterly operating profit on Wednesday, helped by price increases, and raised its full-year earnings forecast. 

 The third-largest U.S. soft drink maker said net income fell to $108 million, or 42 cents per share, from $136 million, or 54 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding special items, operating earnings were 60 cents per share, topping analysts' average forecast by 5 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. In addition to Dr Pepper and Snapple beverages, the company also makes the 7UP soft drink, Mott's apple juice and Hawaiian Punch fruit drinks. Net sales for the quarter rose 1 percent to $1.56 billion, helped by price increases. But the price increases, along with the weak U.S. economy, also contributed to a 4 percent decline in sales volume. Volume fell 3 percent in North America -- the company's largest market by far -- and fell 9 percent in both Mexico and the Caribbean. Carbonated soft drink volume fell 3 percent, while noncarbonated drink volume fell 8 percent. The company stood by its full-year forecast for sales growth of 3 percent to 5 percent. It raised its forecast for earnings per share, before special items, by 3 cents to at least $1.94. Analysts on average had been expecting $1.91. Dr Pepper shares began trading on the New York Stock Exchange at $25 on May 7, after its "when-issued" shares fell nearly 14 percent from their debut at $29. The shares closed at $21.66 on Tuesday.
