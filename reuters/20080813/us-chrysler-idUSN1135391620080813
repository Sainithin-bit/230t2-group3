 TRAVERSE CITY, Michigan  (Reuters) - Chrysler LLC has talked with automakers in Russia and India about potential tie-ups and was approached by Fiat about a partnership, although no formal discussions are ongoing, a senior Chrysler executive said on Wednesday. 

 Chrysler, the No. 3 U.S.-based automaker, is also planning a new car-based SUV that will hit showrooms in 2010, and has identified over $1 billion in non-earning assets it will sell to raise cash as it tries to turn around its operations. Chrysler Vice Chairman and President Tom Lasorda said the automaker is moving ahead with plans to forge alliances, especially in emerging markets. "When we look at alliances in different regions, we have had discussions with multiple companies in Russia," LaSorda said on the sidelines of an industry event. "In India we have had discussions with many companies." LaSorda, who declined to name the companies, said the automaker may decide on a Russian partner by the end of 2009. Chrysler was approached by Fiat SpA, the Italian automaker, for a potential partnership, he said. "Have they approached us? Yes," he told reporters, referring to Fiat. "At this stage there is no formal discussion going on, but there was an inquiry." Fiat Chief Executive Sergio Marchionne, credited with turning around the Alfa Romeo, Lancia and Fiat brands, has said Fiat is looking for a partner for its return to the North American market. Sources said last month Chrysler was in talks with Fiat about leasing manufacturing capacity and sharing retail distribution, which would allow Fiat to return to the U.S. market for the first time in 25 years. Chrysler is also in discussions with India's Tata Motors Ltd about selling its Jeep Wrangler SUV in India and possibly other Asian markets, according to sources. LaSorda said Chrysler's owner, Cerberus Capital Management LP, was committed to "holding on" to the automaker for the long term as it seeks tie-ups amid a steep decline in U.S. auto sales. Detroit automakers have been hit hard by a dramatic shift in buying to passenger cars and fuel-efficient car-based SUVs, forcing them to restructure. Chrysler's U.S. sales have declined 23 percent through the first seven months of the year. NEW CROSSOVER SUV Chrysler plans to invest about $1.8 billion over the next two years to retool and expand its Jefferson North assembly plant in Detroit that builds the Jeep Grand Cherokee, a truck-based SUV. The new car-based SUV will retain the Grand Cherokee name, LaSorda said. U.S. sales of Grand Cherokee are down 32 percent year to date as Americans shun gas-thirsty large vehicles amid record high gas prices. Chrysler also expects to finalize design plans for the new small car being built for the automaker by Nissan Motor Co within the next couple months. The global small car, which will be built in Japan, is on track to be sold in 2010, LaSorda said. Chrysler, acquired by Cerberus a year ago, has faced scrutiny over whether it can ride out a downturn in U.S. auto sales that many analysts expect to stretch through 2009. The automaker plans to raise cash by selling non-earning assets such as land and office space. "One advantage of private ownership is that we can sell non-earning assets to generate cash," LaSorda said. "To date, we have identified over $1 billion in assets, and we are more than half way to achieving that goal." The automaker has sold over $500 million in assets, including land around its headquarters in Auburn Hills, Michigan, and its Tritec engine plant in Brazil, according to LaSorda. As a private company, Chrysler can focus on cash and not worry about recording write-downs for any loss in the book value of the asset being sold, LaSorda said. He also said the automaker is meeting or exceeding its financial targets. Chrysler ended June with $11.7 billion in cash, and had earnings of $1.1 billion before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization in the first half of the year. (Editing by Gerald E.
