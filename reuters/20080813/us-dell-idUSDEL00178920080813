 NEW DELHI  (Reuters) - Dell Inc DELL.O, the world's second-largest personal computer maker, sees industry computer sales worldwide in the second half of this year exceeding the first half as slowing economic growth globally drives demand for efficiencies. 

 Chief Executive Michael Dell said on Wednesday about 300 million personal computers were likely to be sold worldwide this year and he thought the company he founded could grow faster than the industry. "When companies and economies are under pressure, people look for ways to become more productive," he told reporters on a visit to the Indian capital. "I think the overall industry growth will be pretty healthy. I feel it is possible that Dell will grow faster than the industry." Research firm IDC has said worldwide PC shipments were expected to rise 13 percent to reach 296 million units in 2008 and would grow about 10 percent in each of the next two years. Last month, surveys showed growth slowed in the U.S. market, the world's largest economy, for home and business computers in the second quarter because of the ongoing economic uncertainty. However Dell, which trailed Hewlett-Packard Co ( HPQ.N ) in worldwide shipments but remains the U.S. market leader, shipped 5 million PCs domestically during the quarter, increasing its market share by 12 percent from a year ago, the surveys said. On Tuesday, Dell introduced a line of portable computers, hoping that lighter-weight machines with longer-lasting batteries will drive sales to business customers. The product rollout was the largest for Dell since it posted a higher-than-expected quarterly profit in May, which was driven by cost cuts and strong demand from consumers and foreign markets, led by Brazil, Russia, India and China. At that time, Dell pointed to the strong performance as evidence that a year-long turnaround led by its founder, who returned to the chief executive post in January 2007, was working. Dell, which considers India as its fastest-growing market, aims to reach $1 billion in revenue in 2009, from $700 million in 2007, Paul-Henri Ferrand, president of its Asia Pacific business said. The company has a computer-making facility in southern India with annual capacity of 1 million units. It also runs four customer contact centers in Bangalore and Hyderabad in south India, and Delhi and Chandigarh in the north. (Reporting by  Devidutta Tripathy ; Editing by  Charlotte Cooper )
