 STOCKHOLM  (Reuters) - Sweden's financial watchdog said on Friday the country's four biggest banks all passed a European Union stress test, saying they were strong enough to withstand another economic downturn. 

 Sweden's Financial Supervisory Authority said in a statement that Nordea -- the Nordic region's biggest bank -- SEB, Handelsbanken and Swedbank all passed the test "with a comfortable margin." "The major banks have enough capital to weather even more severe scenarios than what was assumed in this stress test. Thus, there is currently no need for any of the major banks to strengthen their capitalization, from a regulatory perspective," it said. "However, in extreme scenarios the market may require even higher capital ratios, which requires the banks to have capital contingency plans even for highly unlikely scenarios." Sweden's financial watchdog conducted the test on behalf of the Committee of European Banking Supervisors, the group presiding over the test of 91 lenders across the region. Capital ratios at the Swedish banks, which have limited exposure to sovereign debt in southern Europe, are among the highest in Europe.
