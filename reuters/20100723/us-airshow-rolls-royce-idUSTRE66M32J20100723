 LONDON  (Reuters) - British aircraft engine maker Rolls-Royce ( RR.L ) said it secured $1.7 billion in orders at the Farnborough Airshow, including deals for its Trent 700 engine, the leading engine for the Airbus ( EAD.PA ) A330. Rolls-Royce said on Friday it won orders totaling more than $1 billion for Trent 700s to power 17 Airbus A330s from Russia's Aeroflot and Garuda Indonesia Airlines. 

 Rolls-Royce also signed new service agreements with Sichuan Airlines, and extended service deals with Garuda and Air Transat at the show in south-east England. International Aero Engines, in which Rolls-Royce is a partner, received orders for V2500 engines from Yemenia, China Southern and Vietnam Airlines, with a value to Rolls-Royce of about $470 million, and its defense business won a $70 million contract to support the Canadian Air Force CC-130J fleet.
