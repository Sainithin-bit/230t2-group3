 NEW YORK/SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Oilfield services leader Schlumberger Ltd ( SLB.N ) increased its quarterly profit on brisk activity on land in North America, but its shares dropped nearly 5 percent as analysts had hoped for more. 

 While uncertainty surrounds its seismic reservoir-mapping unit and there has been a sharp drop in oilfield spending in Mexico, the company's outlook is broadly unchanged otherwise, giving investors few reasons to jump in to the stock. The performance was particularly disappointing when set against Halliburton Co ( HAL.N ), the second-largest oilfield services company, which blew away estimates with its results on Monday thanks to its greater U.S. onshore drilling interests. "There wasn't anything as remotely seductive as what you saw from Halliburton," said David Havens, oilfield services analyst at Sterne Agee, putting this down to the lighter impact of U.S. drilling growth given the size of Schlumberger, which generated a third more revenue overall than its nearest rival. But he noted the outlook for U.S. land drilling next year was not so strong, given persistently weak natural gas prices. Simmons & Co's Bill Herbert was another analyst expecting better numbers from Schlumberger after the results for its peers. Weatherford Ltd ( WFT.N ) also beat expectations this week. Halliburton impressed the market even though it said earnings will be cut by 5 to 8 cents per share for the next two quarters due to the Gulf of Mexico impact. The April 20 blow-out at a BP Plc ( BP.L ) well, on which Halliburton had performed cementing work, led to a regulatory crackdown as the U.S. government froze deepwater activity in the Gulf through November while it crafts new safety rules. Schlumberger is not as exposed to the Gulf, accounting for only about 5 percent of its revenue, compared with about an eighth for Halliburton. Schlumberger's second-quarter profit rose to $818 million, or 68 cents a share, from $613 million, or 51 cents, last year. That was in line with analysts' estimates, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose 7 percent to $5.9 billion. SLOWLY INCREASING ACTIVITY Chief Executive Andrew Gould said the recovery in world oil demand was reasonably robust and he expected slowly increasing levels of exploration and production activity this year. Pretax profit at Schlumberger's oilfield service arm grew 5 percent to $1.07 billion, with gains in Russia, Latin America and the North Sea as well the North American onshore growth. "I have no doubt that U.S. land margins will continue to improve provided the rig count holds up," Gould said on a call with analysts, adding that he expected North American margins overall to end 2010 at about the level of the first half. But the company's WesternGeco seismic arm, which maps oil and gas reservoirs, saw pretax profit drop 52 percent as activity fell off from a strong first quarter. Its outlook will be reliant on the uncertain Gulf of Mexico market, Gould said. Schlumberger does not see Gulf of Mexico activity revived in 2010, and has accelerated a review of U.S. operations due to the knock-on effect of the Gulf spill. Havens at Sterne Agee said the unenthusiastic reception for Schlumberger's second-quarter results did not change a broader shift by investors out of rig contractors and into oil services companies, simply because the latter looked far more likely to return to their peak profitability over time. "It's difficult to formulate a scenario where the deepwater drillers can do that," Havens said. Shares of Diamond Offshore Drilling Inc ( DO.N ), the world's second-largest rig contractor by market value, fell 2.1 percent on Friday, a day after cutting its dividend and posting a weak profit, partly due to the Gulf of Mexico. Gould said higher drilling costs in the Gulf due to tighter regulations would have less of an impact on smaller players remaining there than how risk is shared for future spills. "The very real issue that our customers will have a great deal of difficulty coming to terms with is what is the ultimate liability going to be," Gould said, adding that it could become a market limited to majors and government-backed operators. "But I think it's a little too early to assume that." Schlumberger shares, down 6 percent this year, were down 4.7 percent at $58.45 on the New York Stock Exchange in early afternoon on Friday. Halliburton shares were down 0.9 percent. (Reporting by Matt Daily in New York and Braden Reddall in San Francisco; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn, John Wallace and  Matthew Lewis )
