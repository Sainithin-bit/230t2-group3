 BEIJING  (Reuters) - China denounced U.S. anti-dumping tariffs on solar panels on Friday as unfair and damaging to both producers and consumers, warning that Washington's decision sent a "negative signal" about trade protectionism. 
 "The U.S. decision lacks fairness, and China expresses its strong displeasure", a spokesman for China's Ministry of Commerce, Shen Danyang, said in a statement posted on the ministry's website (www.mofcom.gov.cn). "By deliberately provoking trade friction in the clean energy sector, the U.S. is sending the world a negative signal about trade protectionism," said Shen. In its ruling, Washington sided with U.S.-based solar companies that had complained a wave of Chinese imports had wrongly undercut their pricing and forced several renewable players out of business.
