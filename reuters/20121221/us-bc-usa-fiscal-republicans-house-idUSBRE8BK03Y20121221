 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The Republican-led U.S. House of Representatives, which abruptly recessed on late Thursday after failing to muster enough support for a "fiscal cliff" bill, may return as soon as December 27 with a yet-to-be-decided new plan, said a senior party aide. 
 The aide, asking not to be identified by name, said House Republicans were "a few votes short" of the number needed to pass the tax plan offered by House Speaker John Boehner. But the aide added, "the overwhelming majority of the conference was with him." (Reporting By  Thomas Ferraro ,; editing by  Stacey Joyce )
