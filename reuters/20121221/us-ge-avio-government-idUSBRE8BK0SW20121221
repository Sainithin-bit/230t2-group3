 ROME  (Reuters) - The Italian government welcomed the acquisition of the aviation unit of aerospace supplier Avio by U.S. giant General Electric ( GE.N ), saying on Friday it was a demonstration of Italy's attractiveness to foreign and domestic investors. 
 GE agreed to buy Avio's aviation division for $4.3 billion from private equity fund Cinven and state-controlled defense group Finmeccanica ( SIFI.MI ). "The operation shows how Italy is becoming a country that is more competitive and more attractive to foreign and Italian investment," Prime Minister Mario Monti's office said in a statement.
