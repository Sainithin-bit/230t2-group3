 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Following the collapse of congressional Republicans' "Plan B" tax cut bill, the White House pledged on Thursday to work with Congress to avoid year-end "fiscal cliff" tax hikes and spending cuts and said President Barack Obama is hopeful a deal can be reached quickly. 
 "The president will work with Congress to get this done and we are hopeful that we will be able to find a bipartisan solution quickly that protects the middle class and our economy," White House spokesman Jay Carney said in a statement. (Reporting By  Mark Felsenthal , Editing by Stacey Joyce)
