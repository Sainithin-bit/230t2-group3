 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Several Wall Street professionals and their relatives or friends were charged with running an insider trading ring with information on mergers and acquisitions, officials said on Thursday. 

 The criminal and civil cases in U.S. District Court in Manhattan involve former employees at financial firms, including UBS AG, Jefferies Group and Blackstone Group LP. Authorities contend they leaked confidential information about supermarket chain Albertsons Inc before its 2006 buyout became public, as well as inside tips on other companies, allowing family and friends in Greece, Cyprus and the United States to reap illegal profits of more than $11.6 million. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission brought civil charges against seven men, including an employee of Blackstone Group who had previously been charged criminally for alleged insider trading involving Albertsons stock. The cases were filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan. Criminal charges were brought by U.S. prosecutors against Joseph Contorinis, 44, a former portfolio manager at Jefferies Asset Management LLC; trader Michael Koulouroudis and UBS financial adviser Nicos Achillea Stephanou. Four others, relatives or friends of the three Wall Street professionals, were also facing criminal charges, officials said. Jefferies was not mentioned in the complaint against Contorinis. Firm spokesman Tom Tarrant said Contorinis left a year ago. He declined to comment on the charge or arrest of Contorinis by the FBI on Thursday. UBS spokesman Doug Morris said the firm "has assisted and will continue to assist the authorities in their investigation into the alleged actions of a single UBS employee." Lawyers for Koulouroudis and Stephanou could not immediately be reached for comment. Stephanou, a 34-year-old citizen of Cyprus who lives in London, has been held since December. His father, Achilleas Stephanou, who lives in Cyprus, was also charged in the SEC complaint. Koulouroudis, 58, was arrested by the FBI on Thursday. He was described in court documents as a family friend of Stephanou. He resides in Brooklyn, New York, and has dual citizenship in the United States and Greece, the SEC said. The SEC said Stephanou was a member of the UBS team that advised private equity firm Cerberus in the Albertsons buyout and tipped others to material details about the deal before it became public. Cerberus, as well as Supervalu Inc and CVS Caremark Corp, ultimately bought the supermarket chain. According to the SEC complaint, Stephanou and others also engaged in unlawful insider trading ahead of the buyout of ElkCorp, a company that makes roofing and building products that had also used UBS as its financial adviser. He and others were also accused by the SEC of insider trading involving National Health Investors Inc in 2006. On January 14, U.S. prosecutors filed criminal charges against Ramesh Chakrapani, a managing director at Blackstone accused of tipping off people about the Albertsons acquisition to make $3.6 million in illegal profits in 2006. Chakrapani was one of the defendants named in the SEC complaint on Thursday. The SEC said Chakrapani, through his role at Blackstone, tipped off others.
