 PHILADELPHIA  (Reuters) - Procter & Gamble Co ( PG.N ) hired Goldman Sachs ( GS.N ) to help it sell its pharmaceuticals brands or find other ways to exit the business, sources familiar with the situation said on Thursday. 

 "As always, we don't comment on rumor or speculation about our business," a P&G spokeswoman said on Thursday. Goldman declined to comment. In December, P&G had said it may exit the pharmaceutical business as it focuses on products such as toothpaste and feminine care items. It also has said it would stop making new investments in pharmaceuticals, consider divesting its healthcare brands and focus its health business on over-the-counter healthcare products such as Pepto Bismol and Prilosec. P&G's prescription drugs include Actonel and Enablex. In P&G's fiscal second quarter, ended December 31, healthcare sales fell 6 percent to $3.5 billion, pressured by foreign exchange and a decline in the volume of products sold. Pharmaceutical volume fell mid-single-digits as the company divested some minor brands, which P&G has not named. Healthcare accounted for 17 percent of net sales and 21 percent of net earnings in quarter. P&G, which reported second-quarter results on January 30, lowered its full-year earnings and sales forecast, adding to the list of household products makers tempering expectations as they deal with the recession. P&G expects sales to be flat to down 4 percent in the current fiscal year, ending June 30.
