 ZURICH  (Reuters) - Swiss Re RUKN.VX posted a full-year net loss of around 1 billion Swiss Francs and said Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway was investing 3 billion Swiss francs ($2.63 billion) as the world's second-biggest reinsurer's shareholder's equity dipped to uncomfortable levels. 

 The announcement from Zurich-based Swiss Re was unexpected and comes after its shares came under continued pressure in recent weeks as investors worried about possible writedowns and the need for fresh capital. It had been expected to announce full-year results February 19. ($1=1.143 Swiss Francs) (Reporting by  Jason Rhodes ; Editing by Mike Nesbit)
