 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Chrysler LLC's dealers are caught between a rock and a hard place: either buy more vehicles they don't need so the carmaker can stay in business or don't buy them and watch the car company fail. 

 The struggling U.S. automaker has urged its dealers to take on more inventory in February and March as it looks to boost revenue ahead of a first quarter deadline to secure additional government aid and prove that it is viable. Automakers book revenue when vehicles are shipped to dealers, not when they are sold to customers. With the inventory of cars and trucks totaling nearly nine-months of supply at some dealers, many lack the capacity to take on more vehicles, said Jim Ziegler, a Georgia-based retail consultant for dealers. "The pressure is on from the manufacturer to the field representatives to the dealers. They are getting multiple calls, multiple visits," Ziegler said. "For the most part they are saying no. They are saturated." Chrysler Vice Chairman Jim Press and other executives have fanned out across the country in recent weeks, offering bonuses to dealers to take on more cars and trucks, dealers said. Some dealers are pushing back despite the lucrative deals, accusing Chrysler of trying to force too many vehicles into its sales channel when it should be trying to cut back. "They are trying to stuff additional wholesale inventory out there when there is plenty of inventory," said Mike Jackson, chief executive of AutoNation Inc( AN.N ), the largest U.S. auto dealership group. "It's sort of like after a great Thanksgiving dinner, the hostess brings out another turkey for dessert," he told Reuters in an interview last week. "You just can't eat anymore." FULL-COURT PRESS Press underscored Chrysler's dismal financial situation in a presentation last month to more than 3,000 U.S. dealers at the National Automobile Dealers Association convention. He also asked dealers to help restructure and preserve Chrysler. Press urged dealers to order 78,000 new vehicles from the automaker in February, a tall order given that Chrysler's U.S. sales fell 30 percent in 2008 and 55 percent in January. Dealer orders were around 22,000 vehicles in January. On average, dealers had a five-months' supply as of the end of January. Chrysler, widely seen as the weakest of Detroit's three automakers, has taken $4 billion in U.S. government loans and is asking for another $3 billion. The automaker, held and run by Cerberus Capital Management CBS.UL, ended 2008 with $2 billion in cash. It faces a Feb 17 deadline to prove to U.S. lawmakers it can be viable. Michael Andretta, who has a Chrysler dealership in Pennsylvania, was convinced he needed to do his part to assist with the restructuring. "I'm going to go back and I'm going to order cars that I don't need," he said, after Press's briefing. Alan Helfman, a Chrysler dealer in Houston, said he ordered more vehicles as he needed them. "Our inventories are pretty good and the terms are pretty good. It's a good promotion," Helfman said, adding that there could be risks to ordering more as the market is down. "These are tumultuous times," he said. Throughout this week and into the next, Chrysler said its executives will be meeting with dealers across the country to share details about the company's plans. Press told reporters on Tuesday, ahead of a meeting with dealers in Detroit, Chrysler wants dealers to be ready for the spring selling months. "What we are trying to do is lay out to the dealers what our view of the market is and what our plans are so that they can take that into account when they develop their own ordering and stocking strategies going forward," Press said. Press said the automaker has taken measures to reduce inventories, including shutting down production for a month and offering aggressive rebates and cheap loans on vehicles. Chrysler has had difficulties with its inventories in the past. In 2006, the company produced vehicles without orders and pressured dealers to take them. The vehicles in the controversial "sales bank" -- parking lots full of vehicles unassigned to any dealers -- swelled to 100,000 during the year. Press said the automaker hasn't built any cars for a sales bank since Cerberus took over in 2007. "We're only building to order," he said. "The sales we have are built for retail."
