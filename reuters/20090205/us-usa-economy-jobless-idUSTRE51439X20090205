 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The number of U.S. workers filing new claims for jobless benefits hit a 26-year high last week, according to government data on Thursday that showed the economy remains on a deep downward track. 

 In addition, the number of people staying on the benefit rolls hit a record high in the week ended January 24, showing the weak labor market has yet to hit bottom. "Ugly," said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York. "This report points to pick-up in the rate of deterioration in job losses at the end of the month. That's to be contrasted to less bad news elsewhere." The data comes ahead of Friday's closely watched employment report, which is expected to show job losses accelerated in January. An independent report released on Wednesday showed the U.S. private sector purged 522,000 jobs last month. The Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment insurance benefits rose 35,000 to a seasonally adjusted 626,000 in the week ended January 31, the highest since the week ending October 30, 1982. The prior week's number was revised up to 591,000 from 588,000. Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast 585,000 new claims. Boris Schlossberg, director of currency research at GFT Forex in New York, said the claims data showed the economy was "convulsing and contracting." "The economy clearly is in desperate need of a stimulus," he added. U.S. stock prices fell in response to the data, while government bond prices tapped a safe-haven bid. The collapse of the U.S. housing market has triggered the worst economic and financial crisis since the Great Depression of the 1930s, sinking the U.S. economy deeper into recession. That economic downturn, which started in December 2007, has been marked by soaring unemployment as companies respond to a slump in demand. PRODUCTIVITY UP Illustrating the rapid deterioration of the labor market, the number of people staying on the benefit rolls after drawing an initial week of aid surged by 20,000 to a record 4.788 million in the week ended January 24, the latest week for which the data is available, the Labor Department said. That was up from 4.768 million the previous week. The four-week moving average for new claims, considered to be a better gauge of underlying trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, rose to 582,250, the highest reading since the week ending December 4, 1982. In an effort to deal with the increasingly worsening economic environment, companies are slashing their employees' work hours. A separate report from the Labor Department showed hours worked outside the farm sector fell at an 8.4 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter, the biggest decline since the first quarter of 1975. In the manufacturing sector, hours worked slumped 14.1 percent. Non-farm productivity rose at a 3.2 percent annual rate from the 1.5 percent increase in the third quarter, while output plunged 5.5 percent, falling at the fastest pace since the first quarter of 1982. Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast productivity increasing at a 1.4 percent rate. For 2008, productivity rose 2.8 percent, the largest rise since a matching rate set in 2004. "Companies are still trying to cut costs to bring them into line with their weak sales," said Gary Thayer, senior economist at Wachovia Securities in St. Louis. "The fourth-quarter productivity numbers show that they are moving in that direction. It looks like there will be some more cost-cutting here in the first quarter." Manufacturing productivity declined at a 3 percent pace after a record 3.3 percent decline in the third quarter, the report showed. Unit labor costs, a gauge of inflation and profit pressures closely watched by the Federal Reserve, were up 1.8 percent in the fourth quarter, the preliminary report showed, well below Wall Street's estimates for a 3 percent increase.
