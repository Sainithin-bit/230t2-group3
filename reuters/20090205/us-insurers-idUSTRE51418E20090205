 ZURICH  (Reuters) - U.S. investor Warren Buffett shored up weakened world No. 2 reinsurer Swiss Re RUKN.VX with a 3 billion Swiss franc ($2.6 billion) investment on Thursday as the Swiss group wrote down twice that amount in toxic assets. 

 A second Swiss insurer, Zurich Financial Services AG ( ZURN.VX ), reported a 23 percent fall in business operating profit for 2008, missing forecasts as it cut its dividend and announced more cost cuts. Swiss Re made the surprise investment announcement along with a 2008 net loss of around 1 billion francs. It also said it would disband its financial markets activities and consider raising further equity of up to 2 billion francs. Ratings agency Standard & Poor's said it was putting Swiss Re's AA- rating on credit watch with negative implications. "Both the magnitude of the additional writedowns and the resulting need to raise capital are outside of our expectations," said S&P credit analyst Peter Grant. Swiss Re Chief Financial Officer George Quinn told Reuters the company would work hard to maintain the rating it thinks its core business deserves. "What we are doing here is not trying to protect the AA rating, but to protect our capital strength to ensure the continued trust of our clients," Quinn said. Swiss Re's shares tumbled up to 30 percent to a 16-year low of 21.20 francs and were still trading down 27 percent at 21.90 francs by 1600 GMT. The stock had already lost 40 percent in 2009 as investors worried about a lack of transparency on writedowns. The shares in the world's biggest reinsurer, Munich Re ( MUVGn.DE ), have fallen by less than 5 percent and those of No. 4 player Hannover Re ( HNRGn.DE ) have risen by more than a fifth. Zurich dropped over 4 percent, compared with the European insurance sector .SXIP, which was 2.5 percent weaker. "Zurich is definitely a contrast to Swiss Re. Both are in a difficult environment, but Zurich has done the better job to date," said Vontobel analyst Stefan Schuermann. The news of Swiss Re's loss came just a day after U.S. insurer Prudential Financial Inc ( PRU.N ) posted a $1.64 billion quarterly loss, hurt by investment writedowns. BUFFETT BARGAINS? Buffett's move through Berkshire Hathaway Inc ( BRKa.N ) is the latest in a series of investments he has made in crisis-hit companies, including General Electric Co ( GE.N ) and Goldman Sachs Group Inc ( GS.N ). Conversion of Berkshire Hathaway's investment would take its stake in Swiss Re to around 24 to 25 percent, the reinsurer's CFO said. The terms of the conversion were set at 25 Swiss francs per share after three years, with a price adjustment if there is a rights issue of more than 2 billion francs within six months. The instruments have a coupon of 12 percent and the face value represents a hefty discount on Wednesday's Swiss Re closing price of 30.04 Swiss francs. When asked if Swiss Re intended to exercise the buyback option on the instruments, Quinn said: "We'll do our best to achieve it." Berkshire is best known for its insurance holdings, which generate about half of overall results and include the reinsurer General Re Corp. "Buffett is the choice of pretty much any financial institution in the world," said Glenn Tongue, a managing partner of T2 Partners LLC in New York, which owns Berkshire stock. "His investment supports a more stable balance sheet for Swiss Re. Buffett's involvement gives Swiss Re's counterparties an added degree of comfort." The deal extends a relationship struck between Buffett and Swiss Re just over a year ago, when the billionaire investor's fund took a 3 percent stake in the insurer and 20 percent of its property and casualty reinsurance business. "This agreement is a strong sign of our financial flexibility but we certainly don't see Mr Buffett as a source that we can go back with any further issues any more than any other stakeholder," said Quinn. Swiss Re said demand for reinsurance has increased, as many clients want protection to offset the erosion of their capital and it expects to report an increase in rates of about 2 percent in 2008 and the reinsurance premium cycle to harden further. But it sought additional capital and said its shareholders' equity at the end of 2008 was estimated at between 19 billion to 20 billion francs, below the level needed for an AA rating. BUFFERS And investors are still wondering whether Swiss Re will need yet more capital. "What we've tried to do is establish what we believe to be a reasonable buffer," said Quinn in a media conference call. "There can be no assurance that this would be sufficient in every circumstance. "If we see either further very significant changes in asset values or, for example, a large natural catastrophe, that may deplete Swiss Re capital," CFO Quinn said. A 5 billion franc capital injection would take Swiss Re's shareholders' equity to a similar level as at the end of the third quarter, 24 billion francs. This buffer proved insufficient in the fourth quarter for the company to retain its AA rating, as asset values fell more than Swiss Re anticipated. Chief Executive Officer Jacques Aigrain said Swiss Re had never approached the Swiss government or Swiss National Bank over the possibility of a bailout and it preferred to fund itself privately. RING-FENCING TOXIC ASSETS Swiss Re said it would reorganize its financial markets activities into two new businesses, including a legacy unit which will manage structured credit default swaps and other toxic assets after the 6 billion franc writedown for the full year. Swiss Re uses the term structured CDS to refer to protection it wrote in the credit default swaps market for a large, unidentified client on a portfolio of structured credit securities, said John Raymond, an analyst at CreditSights. The portfolio had a par value of about 5.3 billion francs and included U.S. subprime mortgage-backed securities, collateralized debt obligations and a variety of other assets that have dropped in value in the credit crisis. The reinsurer first called attention to this portfolio in November 2007, taking a 1.2 billion franc writedown on mostly the subprime part of the portfolio. By end-August, additional writedowns had brought the value down to 1.95 billion francs. Swiss Re, which slashed its dividend to 0.10 francs per share, would give an update on February 19, the date 2008 results were originally scheduled, Quinn said. Zurich also cut its dividend to 11 Swiss francs ($9.62) per share from 15 francs for 2007 and announced a further $200 million in cost cuts. Zurich's general insurance gross written premiums rose 4 percent to $37.2 billion. The company's combined ratio, which measures costs and claims as a percentage of premium income, rose to 98.1 percent at end-2008, from 95.6 percent a year earlier. The lower the benchmark, the higher Zurich's underwriting profitability.
