 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Insurer Cigna Corp ( CI.N ) posted a quarterly net loss on Thursday, hurt by investment losses and market-sensitive reinsurance businesses it no longer actively sells, although its adjusted profit beat analysts' targets as the company cut bonuses for senior managers. 

 Cigna, one of the largest U.S. health insurers, slightly lowered its full-year earnings forecast as it projected a steeper decline in health-plan membership. The Philadelphia-based company posted a net loss of $209 million, or 77 cents per share, compared with year-earlier net income of $263 million, or 93 cents per share. Cigna's 2008 results have been hurt by two businesses it no longer actively markets: minimum-income benefits and death benefits. In both businesses, the company's liabilities increase in periods of declining equity markets and interest rates. Combined, those two businesses had quarterly after-tax losses of about $405 million, or $1.51 per share. Cigna also took an after-tax charge of 13 cents per share for a cost-savings plan. The company said last month it would cut 1,100 jobs, or about 4 percent of its workforce, as it copes with the economic downturn. Excluding items, the company reported earnings of 49 cents per share. Analysts on average expected 41 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. Cigna said its results benefited from a "significant reduction" in bonuses for senior managers of $35 million after taxes. That equates to about 13 cents per share, according to Wachovia analyst Matt Perry. "The outperformance in (the fourth quarter) was from a reduction in management compensation in the healthcare segment as well as favorable items in the disability and life segment," Perry said in a research note. Aside from its operations, investors have been concerned about Cigna's balance sheet and capital position in light of the weak markets. "Shares should trade higher on the results and outlook, but the key takeaway here is that Cigna's balance sheet and capital came through very well relative to an extreme level of concern that has plagued the stock valuation," said Goldman Sachs analyst Matthew Borsch, who noted that Cigna's valuation is less than half that of rivals. Revenue rose 8 percent to $4.82 billion, ahead of the $4.76 billion expected by analysts. Its health-plan enrollment stood at 11.7 million at the end of 2008. Cigna's medical costs for coverage plans for which it assumes full risk consumed more premium revenue than some analysts expected -- which investors often view as a worrisome sign about a health insurer's profit margins. The results show how Cigna -- whose shares dropped 69 percent last year -- has been among the hardest hit health insurers by the rocky economy. Large employers that make up a significant portion of Cigna's customers have been laying off workers. For 2009, Cigna nudged down its expected earnings outlook by 5 cents per share, to a range of $3.95 to $4.25. Analysts are looking for $3.84. Cigna projected its membership to fall by 3 percent in 2009, after saying in November that it expected a 2 percent drop. After falling as low as $8 in November, Cigna shares have rebounded somewhat, closing on Wednesday at $18.02. They have risen about 7 percent in 2009 roughly in line with the rise for the S&P Managed Health Care index .GSPHMO. (Reporting by  Lewis Krauskopf ; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn and  Derek Caney )
