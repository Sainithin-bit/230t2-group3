 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - More signs of deep recession hit markets on Thursday, dragging oil and stock prices down, but talk that a U.S. rescue plan for banks may alter a key accounting rule later lifted both the dollar and Wall Street. 

 The U.S. dollar rose to near a one-month high against the yen as a rally in U.S. stocks dimmed its appeal as a safe haven. A warning from the European Central Bank that the euro zone was undergoing an extended downturn helped weaken the euro. Oil prices at first fell as data showed U.S. jobless claims hit a 26-year high while German manufacturing and industrial production in Spain both slumped, providing fresh evidence that the developed world is falling into a prolonged recession. But U.S. stocks rallied after financial services companies cut steep losses on news the U.S. Senate might suspend mark-to-market accounting for tainted banking assets. The rule has forced banks to report billions of dollars in write-downs. "The market suspects there may be a suspension of mark-to-market accounting as part of the plan coming out of Washington to shore up the financial system," said Peter Kenny, managing director at Knight Equity Markets in Jersey City, New Jersey. "It would be very impactful." Sen. Christopher Dodd, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, said late Wednesday that it might be possible to modify the accounting rule without abandoning its underlying standard. Shares of Bank of America ( BAC.N ), which at one point had fallen to lows last seen in 1984, cut losses of almost 20 percent to trade down just 4.3 percent. The KBW bank index .BKX sharply pared losses of as much as 6.8 percent to trade higher about 1.5 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  rose 122.42 points, or 1.54 percent, at 8,079.08. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  gained 16.12 points, or 1.94 percent, at 848.35. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  added 29.35 points, or 1.94 percent, at 1,544.40. European shares fell, led by financials, as bleak economic data bode ill for corporate earnings prospects. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index  .FTEU3  closed 0.1 percent lower at 810.49 points, well above its intra-day low after U.S. stocks rallied. Stocks shrugged off monetary policy decisions by the Bank of England, which cut its base interest rate by 50 basis points to a record low 1.0 percent, and the European Central Bank, which left key rates unchanged as expected. Reinsurer Swiss Re RUKN.VX posted a full-year net loss of around a billion Swiss francs and its stock tumbled 28 percent. Swiss Re said Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway was investing three billion Swiss francs ($2.63 billion) in the company. European government bonds rallied, pushing the two-year yield to a two-week low, after the ECB Jean-Claude Trichet said zero interest rates were not something the bank considered "appropriate," which also helped limit euro losses. However, the ECB signaled it may resume a monetary easing cylce in March. "The message from Trichet was not particularly exciting, but clearly it's an environment that clearly supports lower rates," said Gianluca Salford, European fixed income strategist at JPMorgan in London. The benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury note pared gains and turned flat on Wall Street's rally, curbing a safe-haven bid for bonds. The price on 10-year government debt was briefly unchanged at 106-24/32, below the session high of 107-18/32. The yield, which moves inversely to its price, was 2.93 percent, up from a session low of 2.86 percent. Economic data initially pushed oil down. The U.S. Labor Department said first-time claims for unemployment insurance benefits rose to 626,000, well above what analysts expected. "The number of jobless people keeps mounting and this will weigh again on the energy complex," said Phil Flynn, an analyst at Alaron Trading in Chicago. Oil later turned on rising U.S. stock prices. U.S. light sweet crude oil rose 43 cents to $40.75 a barrel. Spot gold prices rose $4.65 to $910.05 an ounce. Deepening concerns about a drop in U.S. consumer demand helped push MSCI's index of Asia-Pacific stocks outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS down 0.4 percent, while Japan's Nikkei average  .N225  slipped 1.1 percent.
