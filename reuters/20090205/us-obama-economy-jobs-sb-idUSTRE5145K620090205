 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - President Barack Obama predicted more grim economic news when the government releases its January employment data on Friday. 

 "Tomorrow, we're expecting another dismal jobs report on top of the 2.6 million jobs that we lost last year," Obama said during a visit to the Department of Energy on Thursday. (Reporting by  Caren Bohan ; Editing by  Patricia Zengerle )
