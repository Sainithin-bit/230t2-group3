 FRANKFURT/MADRID  (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank ( DBKGn.DE ) predicted a bleak future on Thursday as it swung to a heavy loss and rising bad debts hit other European banks, while U.S. banks shares rallied on hopes about the Obama administration's plans to shore up the financial system. 

 The fall from grace for the one-time investment banking star Deutsche Bank, which made a net loss of almost 4 billion euros last year, was in sharp contrast to a 9 billion euro ($11.7 billion) profit turned by Spain's Santander ( SAN.MC ). But with Spain's economy deep in the doldrums, even Santander was forced to ramp up the amount it put aside for unpaid loans by about 60 percent last year. Deutsche Bank was hit by heavy writedowns and a plunge in revenues from trading debt and other products, which shriveled from 8.4 billion euros to a trickle of just 124 million. The financial storm that accelerated with the collapse of Lehman Brothers last year is also piling misery on other European and American banks. Bank of America Corp ( BAC.N ) shares fell early to their lowest level since 1984 on swelling fears about losses tied to a bad economy and its acquisition of Merrill Lynch & Co, but later recovered amid a wider rally in U.S. financials on optimism that Obama will propose a plan to help banks stem losses and revive lending. Traders said investor sentiment was buoyed by talk that Washington would suspend an accounting requirement on the recognition of losses that has resulted in billions of dollars of write-downs for banks. "The notion that you can suspend this mark-to-market provision, which was established after Enron, as way of halting the slide in the value of financials is at the fundamental core of putting on the brakes," said Peter Kenny, managing director at Knight Equity Markets in Jersey City, New Jersey. "The market reaction is a barometer of how well (the suspension) could impact market psychology and market value." Adding to positive sentiment, institutional money manager State Street Corp ( STT.N ) took aggressive steps to strengthen its capital, including nearly eliminating its dividend and slashing bonus payments. While its shares also initially dipped, they later rebounded strongly as investors reacted positively to the moves. The question of a government role in banks also loomed large in Europe, where Danske Bank ( DANSKE.CO ) unveiled a steep fall in profit, under pressure from rising bad debts as it turned to the government for financial help. And Swedish bank SEB ( SEBa.ST ) announced a rights issue to raise $1.8 billion, scrapped its dividend, and said it, too, was likely to tap the government for money as loan losses ballooned. In Switzerland, meanwhile, a government spokesman said the government had never asked UBS ( UBSN.VX ) to break up its business, denying a report in the New York Post. HURRIED MAKEOVER In Spain, Santander Chief Executive Emilio Botin has steered the biggest bank in the euro zone around the worst of the financial storm by sticking to a simple retail bank formula and sidestepping the local property crash. Deutsche Bank, on the other hand, was at the height of its prowess as an investment bank when the crisis struck, forcing it to make writedowns of more than 9 billion euros so far. The German financial flagship has hurriedly reinvented itself as a retail bank during the crisis, striking a deal to buy German post-office lender Deutsche Postbank ( DPBGn.DE ), but the damage was already done. On Thursday, its Swiss Chief Executive Josef Ackermann struck a gloomy note, predicting "very difficult conditions for the global economy" and "significant challenges for our clients and for our industry." Ackermann, who once proclaimed the crisis for the bank over before it had really begun, repeated on Thursday that Deutsche did not want state help to get it through the storm. He also said the year got off to a good start, though 2009 remained unpredictable. Shares in Deutsche closed down 4.2 percent, having been down as much 9.6 percent, while Santander fell 1.1 percent, outperforming the DJ Stoxx European banking index .SX7P, which was down about 2 percent.
