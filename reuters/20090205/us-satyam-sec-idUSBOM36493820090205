 MUMBAI  (Reuters) - A team from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is in India to meet the new board of fraud-hit outsourcer Satyam Computer Services SATY.BO on Thursday, the Times of India paper said, citing sources. 

 The SEC team has already met officials of market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India in Mumbai in relation to India's largest corporate scandal, the paper said, citing unnamed sources. The newspaper said the SEC team may be gathering details of the accounting fraud at New York-listed Satyam SAY.N, as U.S. investors have filed several class action suits against the company. SEBI chairman C.B. Bhave declined to comment on Thursday when asked about the report by journalists at a conference in Mumbai. A Satyam spokeswoman declined to confirm whether the SEC team would visit the company headquarters or meet the company's new government-appointed board, which is meeting in the southern city of Hyderabad to consider various revival options for Satyam. Satyam has been fighting for survival since Ramalinga Raju quit as chairman on January 7, disclosing profits had been overstated for years and that about $1 billion of cash and bank balances on the company's books did not exist.
