 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc reported a better-than-expected 2.1 percent rise in January sales at U.S. stores open at least a year, driven by demand for food, and said it would no longer provide monthly sales forecasts. 

 Instead, the world's biggest retailer said on Thursday that it would give forecasts on a 13-week basis, four times a year. "We believe this guidance is a more appropriate measure for our investors, particularly in volatile times when consumer swings are more difficult to predict," Chief Financial Officer Tom Schoewe said in a statement. Analysts, on average, were expecting Wal-Mart's same-store sales to rise 1.1 percent, according to Reuters Estimates, while the company had forecast sales to be flat to up 2 percent. The world's biggest retailer said net sales in the month rose almost 2 percent to $27.74 billion. (Reporting by  Nicole Maestri ; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn)
