 LONDON  (Reuters) - The Bank of England cut interest rates by 50 basis points on Thursday, taking rates to a record low of 1 percent. 

 Analysts had predicted the move after recent surveys suggested the economy continued to contract at the start of the year. Following are reactions from business groups and economists to the decision. HOWARD ARCHER, GLOBAL INSIGHT "We very much doubt that the Bank of England is done yet in cutting interest rates, despite the growing debate about whether further reductions will do much good. Indeed, we expect to see rates cut again in March and to come down to a low of 0.25% in the second quarter. "Indeed, it is far from inconceivable that interest rates could come all the way down to zero. Consumer price inflation has already retreated to 3.1% in December from 5.2% in September, and it is poised to fall sharply further over the coming months." ADAM CHESTER, HBOS "As widely expected. It's going to be interesting to see the next steps the Bank of England will take in terms of injecting liquidity into the economy. "We expect interest rates to be down pretty much toward zero by the Spring. Clearly, the economic data continues to point to the need for further monetary accommodation. "We expect the Bank to undertake more overt quantitative easing measures in the near future." TREVOR WILLIAMS, LLOYDS TSB "The economic woes that have paved the way to today's base rate decision will not disappear overnight. So the real question is where do we go from here? "Today's cut means that the UK needs to be ready to face a period where the ability of base rates to be used as a lever on the economy is almost entirely diminished. "So now is definitely the time to discuss what other tools might be used to revive the economy in a world where base rate cuts are no longer possible." STUART PORTEOUS, RBS GROUP ECONOMICS "Today's 50bps cut sends a clear message -- putting a floor under the fragile economy remains priority number one, the UK's eight million net savers will have to play second fiddle for now. The Bank is quickly running out of wriggle room on rates. Other weapons in the Bank's arsenal are now being readied for the offensive -- buying assets first, printing money second." JANE MILNE, BRITISH RETAIL CONSORTIUM "Interest rate cuts are not the only tool to fix the recession. The key issue now is not the cost of credit - but its availability. "The Bank of England faces a fine balancing act between further weakening sterling and attempting to revive the economy. What we need now is better access to credit and a boost to consumer confidence." IAN MCCAFFERTY, CBI CHIEF ECONOMIC ADVISOR "This drop in rates should support business confidence and, when added to recent cuts of the past couple of months and the fall in the pound, provides a very significant stimulus to the ailing economy. "But at these very low levels of interest rates, and with the credit mechanism still impaired, it is vital that the Bank swiftly supplements today's move with direct intervention in the corporate lending markets. "Sterilized intervention will help ensure that business is able to obtain the credit it needs to ride through these difficult times, without increasing the money supply. The real problem is not the price of credit, but its availability." DAVID KERN, ECONOMIC ADVISER, BRITISH CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE "With the recession worsening, and deflation a distinct risk, there is still scope for further interest rate cuts in the next few months, to almost zero. "But, with rates at very low levels already, the focus of UK monetary policy must now inevitably shift toward forceful quantitative and credit easing measures, with the aim of increasing the money supply and removing blockages in the credit markets. "Given the Bank's unduly cautious record in the early stages of the credit crisis, UK businesses must be reassured that the Bank will be prepared to implement unconventional techniques. This is vital in order to alleviate the recession, counter threats of deflation, and underpin falling confidence."
