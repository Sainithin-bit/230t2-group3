 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Cisco Systems Inc Chief Executive John Chambers forecast revenue to drop far more sharply in the current quarter than Wall Street expected, and said it was hard to say how long the downturn would last. 

 Investors have played close attention to Chambers's comments on the economy since the network equipment maker is seen as a bellwether for tech spending. Here is a selection of his comments since mid-2007. FEB. 4, 2009 "Being very candid, no one, including us, knows how long it will last," he said, adding that it was "one of the most difficult times" in his career to give a revenue forecast. "If business continues to change dramatically, we would obviously do what is necessary to bring our expense structure in line with revenues," he said. "If that is the case, layoffs could be necessary as they have been one time in the past." JAN. 9, 2009 In a speech at the Consumer Electronics show in Las Vegas, Chambers said he expects GDP (gross domestic product) to resume growth in the second half of 2009. "I think it will be by the second half of this year," he said. He asked the audience whether they saw growth this year or next, and seeing a less than decisive show of hands, he said: "That's pretty typical of what my customers are saying." NOV. 5, 2008 "We do believe that the challenges that initially affected the U.S. have spread to other countries around the world," he told analysts on a conference call. He forecast that fiscal second-quarter revenue would decline by 5 percent to 10 percent from a year earlier, but said it was hard to be sure. "It's probably the second most difficult time in my career in terms of my comfort level with the forecast," he said. SEPT. 16, 2008 Chambers told a financial analysts meeting that Cisco was sticking to its goal of 12 to 17 percent annual revenue growth despite the slow economy. "We've never been more comfortable with our 12 to 17 percent growth long-term projection than we are right now," he said. August 5, 2008 "While it is very difficult to predict when we may see a stronger spending environment by our customers and return to our 12 percent to 17 percent long-term growth objectives, our best estimate ... is that the current economic challenges (will) remain with us for the next few quarters." "Our U.S. enterprise was stronger than we expected this quarter. Our U.S. service provider was a little bit weaker. "But if I look at the total global scenario, (the downturn) is probably going to be a little bit longer than we would have said six months ago. But still, most of my customers see it turning early next year and ... we're budgeting that way." May 6, 2008 "In terms of what we're hearing from our customers, most of them believe that this (slowdown) will be a relatively short-term phenomenon," Chambers told Reuters in an interview after announcing the company's third-quarter results. "Most of my customers believe their business will be coming back up by the end of the year and therefore spending that is tied to their economic scenario should pick back up as well." But he told analysts on a conference call that U.S. and some European customers appeared to be cautious. February 6, 2008 Chambers warned that orders slowed rapidly from December to January in the United States and Europe. "It's the most cautious I've seen CEOs in the U.S. and Europe in many years," he said, citing softness at retailers and transport companies in the United States and at European service providers. November 7, 2007 Chambers warned of "dramatic decreases" in orders from U.S. banks. "The U.S. enterprise, probably as a surprise to no one, is experiencing some softness," he said, blaming the automotive sector as well as banks. He said he expected the U.S. enterprise segment to remain "lumpy." August 7, 2007 "I have been in this business for 30 years.... It's the strongest global economy I have been a part of," he told analysts on a conference call. (Reporting by  Ritsuko Ando ; Editing by  Gary Hill )
