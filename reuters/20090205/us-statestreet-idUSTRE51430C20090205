 BOSTON  (Reuters) - State Street Corp. on Thursday nearly eliminated its dividend and slashed bonus payments to help increase its capital, taking aggressive steps that helped send the financial corporation's stock price up 11 percent. 

 The Boston-based company, one of the world's biggest institutional money managers, cut its 2009 outlook and also unveiled a more conservative reinvestment plan where money from maturing mortgage-backed securities will be moved into central bank deposits. "They are facing their problems head on," said Michael Kon, an analyst at Morningstar after the company made the unexpected announcement. "They could not go on as they were doing." The company said it will pay a 1 cent dividend, marking a 96 percent drop from the 24 cent dividend it paid previously. It will also cut 2008 bonuses by about 50 percent from 2007 levels for most employees and eliminate bonuses for the company's top five executives. In midday trading the company's share price was up 9.7 percent, or $2.33 at $26.43, leading all other assets management companies as the broader market was down. State Street, which holds $12 trillion in assets under custody, made the unexpected announcement less than a month after its stock price plunged 59 percent on the day it released 2008 earnings and said its unrealized investment losses nearly doubled to $10 billion. On Thursday State Street said unrealized investment portfolio losses have improved by $730 million in January. The plunging share price prompted speculation that State Street, which ranks behind Bank of New York Mellon Corp. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. as the third largest custody bank that tracks records for mutual and hedge funds might be taken over. For weeks investors said they were especially worried about State Street's low TCE, or tangible common equity, ratio which measures a company's ability to absorb financial shocks. While investors said the core business was strong with many new business wins, they worried that the weak balance sheet might force the company to raise new capital during difficult market conditions. By cutting the dividend and bonuses, State Street chief executive officer Ron Logue said he now expects the ratio to increase during the first quarter and full year. Ratings agency Standard & Poor's, which cut State Street's rating in January after fourth quarter earnings were released, said the moves announced on Thursday would not affect the rating. "Despite State Street's commitment to returning tangible capital to prior levels, it is questionable whether the measures taken will suffice to satisfy investors and rating agencies," Celent analyst Isabel Schauerte said. The dividend and bonus cuts also allowed State Street to revise fourth quarter results, raising its earnings to 54 cents a share from 15 cents reported on January 20. Still the outlook for 2009 is significantly more gloomy with Logue saying the company expects its operating earnings per share to decline 12 percent to 16 percent this year. Operating revenue is expected to be 8 percent to 12 percent below last year's levels. On January 20, the company said revenue would likely be flat this year.
