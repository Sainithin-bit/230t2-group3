 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Yum Brands Inc ( YUM.N ), parent of the KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell chains, backed its 2010 profit outlook and forecast earnings-per-share growth of at least 10 percent next year. 

 The forecasts, which came ahead of the company's annual investor meeting next week, exclude special items. "2010 has been a strong year led by our China business... We remain on track to deliver 14 percent earnings-per-share growth," Chief Executive David Novak said on Friday. "Continued robust new unit development in China and Yum Restaurants International not only contributed to this year's strong results, but sets the company up for growth in 2011," Novak added in a statement. Yum also announced it expects to deliver at least 10 percent EPS growth in 2011, excluding special items, which would mark its 10th straight year of meeting or exceeding this annual EPS growth target. Edward Jones analyst Jack Russo said the outlook for next year was largely in line with his expectations. "That's what all of us were expecting and that's what they have been really guiding to for the last three to five years," Russo said by phone. Yum shares were down about 1.37 percent, or 70 cents, at $50.24 Friday afternoon on the New York Stock Exchange. (Reporting by  Dhanya Skariachan ; editing by Gunna Dickson, Dave Zimmerman)
