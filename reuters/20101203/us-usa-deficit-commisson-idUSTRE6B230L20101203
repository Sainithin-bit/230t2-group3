 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Recommendations of a deficit-reduction commission appointed by President Barack Obama will not win enough support from its members to force quick action by Congress to carry out those ideas, commission member Senator Kent Conrad said on Friday. 

 "I think it is given that we will not reach 14" votes needed to push the recommendations forward in Congress, said Conrad, who has said he supports the panel's report. "But I think we'll have a solid majority of the commission," he said in a CNBC interview. The commission is set to vote early Friday. (Reporting by  Richard Cowan ; Editing by  Jackie Frank )
