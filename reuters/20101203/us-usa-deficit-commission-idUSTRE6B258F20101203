 (Reuters) - A controversial plan to ease the deficit, advanced by President Barack Obama's deficit commission, failed to win the support it needs to advance to Congress. 

 Eleven of the panel's 18 members backed the recommendations, three short of the 14 needed to force fast congressional action. The deadline for a vote had been December 1 but was extended to Friday, December 3. The panel did not formally vote on it but members expressed their views. But the panel's co-chairs, former Republican Senator Alan Simpson and Clinton administration White House Chief of Staff Erskine Bowles, still believe the blueprint for fiscal recovery can influence lawmakers and the White House in upcoming debates over taxation and spending. Here are the main highlights: THE PLAN CALLS FOR: - Major tax code overhaul - Eliminating many tax breaks to broaden the tax base and help lower overall income tax rates. - Cutting the U.S. budget deficits by nearly $4 trillion over the next decade. - Reducing the budget deficit to 2.3 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) by 2015, from 8.9 percent in the last fiscal year - Capping revenue as a share of the economy to 21 percent and cap spending under 22 percent, from the estimated 15.8 percent and 25.1 percent in 2011, respectively - Stabilizing the growth in national debt by 2014 and reduce the debt to 60 percent of GDP by 2023 and 40 percent by 2035, from the 68.9 percent forecast for 2011 ON TAXES, THE PLAN WOULD: - Cut rates; broaden the tax base; simplify the tax code and curb "tax expenditures," which disguise spending via the tax code; simplify and lower corporate taxes and cap revenue to avoid excessive taxation. - Cut income tax rates across the board and reduce the top rate to between 23 and 29 percent. - Replace the current number of income-tax brackets to three from six. - Simplify corporate taxes by replacing the multiple brackets, which top out at 35 percent, with a single rate between 23 percent and 29 percent. - Tax all capital gains and dividends at ordinary income rates. Another alternative would raise top rates on ordinary income and exclude 20 percent of investment income from taxation. - Raise the federal gasoline tax (currently 18.4 cents per gallon) by 15 cents per gallon to fund transportation spending - Eliminate the Alternative Minimum Tax - Limit the deduction for interest on home mortgages. The proposal would provide a 12 percent nonrefundable tax credit, but limit the deduction to primary residences and cap it at $500,000. - Interest on newly issued state and municipal bonds would be subjected to income taxes. - Maintain the earned-income tax credit and child tax credit - Eliminate itemized deductions so all individuals take standard deductions - Employer Provided Health Care Insurance: exclusion capped at 75th percentile of premium levels in 2014, with cap frozen in nominal terms through 2018 and phased out by 2038. Excise tax reduced to 12 percent - Charitable Giving: 12 percent nonrefundable tax credit available to all taxpayers; available above 2 percent of Adjusted Gross Income floor - Retirement: Consolidate retirement accounts; cap tax-preferred contributions to lower of $20,000 or 20 percent of income, expand saver's credit ON DISCRETIONARY FEDERAL SPENDING: - Cap both security and non-security spending to force budget discipline on Congress. Cut low-priority programs - Streamline government operation. Offer $50 billion in immediate cuts and sketch out $200 billion in illustrative 2015 savings - Make the federal government more efficient: cut the White House and congressional budget by 15 percent; impose a three-year pay freeze on members of Congress; impose a three-year pay freeze on federal workers and Defense Department civilians; cut the size of the federal workforce through attrition; cut federal travel and vehicle budgets; sell excess federal land - Eliminate all congressional earmarks - Cap discretionary spending through 2020: hold spending in 2012 to 2011 levels, return spending to pre-2008 levels by 2013, and limit future spending growth to half the projected rate of inflation through 2020. - Require equal percentage cuts from both security and non-security spending - Enforce spending caps in Congress via a "belt and suspenders" approach to block the passage of any legislative bill that exceeds the caps, and make the Senate wait until a bill is scored by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office before voting on it - At the end of every congressional session, the CBO would have to certify discretionary spending approved by Congress was within limits, and if it was not, the White House Office of Management and Budget would be required to take action - Require the president to propose annual limits for war spending - Establish a disaster fund to budget for catastrophes - Stop the abuse of emergency spending by making Congress define emergency spending ON SOCIAL SECURITY, THE PLAN WOULD: - Gradually increase early and full retirement ages, based on increases in life expectancy - After the Normal Retirement Age reaches 67 in 2027 under current law, index both the normal and Early Eligibility Age to increases in life expectancy, effectively increasing the normal retirement age to 68 by about 2050 and 69 by about 2075, and the earlier retirement age to 63 and 64 in lock step - Gradually increase the taxable maximum to cover 90 percent of wages by 2050 - Reduce poverty by providing an enhanced minimum benefit for low-wage workers - Enhance benefits for the very old and the long-time disabled - Give retirees more flexibility and create a hardship exemption for those who cannot work beyond 62 ON HEALTH CARE COST CONTAINMENT: - Reform physician payments, cost-sharing, malpractice law, prescription drug costs and government-subsidized medical education ON MANDATORY SAVINGS: - Cut agriculture subsidies. Modernize military and civil service retirement systems. Reform student loan programs and the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation.
