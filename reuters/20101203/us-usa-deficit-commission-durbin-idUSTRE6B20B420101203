 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Assistant Senate Democratic Leader Dick Durbin says he will vote for the deficit-reduction plan drafted by co-chairs of a presidential commission, becoming the 10th panel member to back it. 

 The panel's plan needs 14 votes from its 18 members for it to be sent to Congress for action. "I will be voting yes," Durbin wrote in an opinion piece he wrote for Friday's edition of The Chicago Tribune. "It was not an easy decision, and I know my vote will be criticized, but I believe it is the right thing to do." (Reporting by  Thomas Ferraro ; editing by  John O'Callaghan )
