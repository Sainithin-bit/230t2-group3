 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - German business software maker SAP ( SAPG.DE ) is open to intensifying its existing cooperation with Hewlett-Packard Co ( HPQ.N ), its co-CEO told a German paper, but dismissed talk HP may be interested in the company. "This is pure speculation," Jim Hagemann Snabe, who jointly leads SAP with Bill McDermott, told Sueddeutsche Zeitung in an interview published in Friday, when asked whether HP could be interested in SAP. 

 "HP has been a good partner for many years and we are open to expanding this cooperation," he was quoted as saying. HP is led by Leo Apotheker, a former SAP CEO, and SAP has been repeatedly subject to talk HP may mull buying the company. (Reporting by  Christoph Steitz ; Editing by Hans Peters)
