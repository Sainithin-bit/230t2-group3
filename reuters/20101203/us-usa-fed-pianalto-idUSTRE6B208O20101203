 OBERLIN, Ohio  (Reuters) - Cleveland Federal Reserve Bank President Sandra Pianalto said on Thursday that lowering the value of the U.S. dollar is not a goal of the central bank's ultra-easy monetary policy. 

 "We don't target or try to manipulate the value of our currency; we focus on our two objectives of price stability and maximum employment," she said in response to audience questions at an Oberlin College event.
