 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - A bipartisan deal to vote on dueling tax packages fell apart late on Thursday and the Democratic Senate leader will instead set votes on his party's plans to extend only some Bush-era tax cuts, an aide said. 

 Minutes earlier, Democratic senators had said Majority Leader Harry Reid would schedule four votes on the tax plans by both parties to extend some to all of the lower tax rates enacted under former President George W. Bush.
