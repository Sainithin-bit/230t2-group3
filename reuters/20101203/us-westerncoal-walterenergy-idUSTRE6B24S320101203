 LONDON/TORONTO  (Reuters) - U.S.-based Walter Energy Inc ( WLT.N ) said on Friday it will buy Canada's Western Coal WTN.TOWTN.L in a C$3.3 billion ($3.3 billion) deal that will put it on track to becoming the world's No. 3 producer of steel-making metallurgical coal at a time of booming demand. 

 Walter, looking for ways to boost output since the metallurgical coal market bounced back from the global economic crisis about a year ago, will pay C$11.50 a share in cash and stock for Western Coal, a 56 percent premium to Western's share price on November 17, the day before Walter Energy announced its proposal. "This is going to create basically the largest pure play met coal producer in the world," said Meredith Brandy, an analyst at BMO Capital Markets. "The only two companies that will be larger in terms of their presence in the met coal market are going to be BHP Billiton ( BLT.L ) and Teck Resources ( TCKb.TO )." The company does not foresee regulatory obstacles like the ones that saw Canada block BHP Billiton's $39 billion bid for Potash Corp ( POT.TO ) a month ago. That would have been the world's largest takeover to date this year in any industry. SURGING STEEL PRODUCTION The Western Coal deal plays directly to a surge in global steel production being led by China and Brazil, and will eventually double Walter's output base. The enlarged Birmingham, Alabama-based company will have total coal reserves of about 385 million tons and expects to produce more than 20 million tons of coal a year by 2012. "Our combined production capacity and geographic footprint leaves us extremely well positioned to benefit from favorable sector dynamics driven by increased steel production in markets such as China, India and Brazil," said Walter Energy interim Chief Executive Joe Leonard. He said the company will also be in an improved position to pursue more acquisitions further down the road. A year ago, Walter and other coal producers were at the tail end of the worst recession in decades, with plunging steel and electricity demand forcing them to slice production, idle operations and cut jobs to keep prices from plummeting. The slump pushed down Teck's share price by 93 percent after the company borrowed heavily to buy Fording Coal for about US$14 billion at the height of the market in 2008. Teck's shares rebounded with the industry's fortunes, and on Friday touched a record high of C$55.04. REGULATORY CONCERNS? Under the deal with Walter Energy, Western Coal shareholders will get about C$2.1 billion in cash and own about 14 percent of the enlarged company. Completion of the deal is contingent on approvals by Canadian courts and at least two-thirds of Western Coal shareholders, including Walter Energy and Audley Capital. Other regulatory approvals, and a majority of the votes cast by Western Coal's shareholders excluding Walter Energy and Audley Capital, are also required. Western Coal has mines in British Columbia and West Virginia, and metallurgical coal makes up more than three-quarters its portfolio. The transaction is expected to boost Walter Energy's earnings per share in the first full year after completion, which is expected by the second quarter of 2011. Hedge fund Audley Capital, which owns about 18 percent in Western Coal, nets a C$650 million windfall from the bid, marking a return to prominence for managing partner Julian Treger. Metallurgical coal is a key ingredient in about 70 percent of worldwide steel production and steel demand is forecast to hit a record 1.34 billion tonnes in 2011. Shares in Western Coal were up 11.5 percent in Toronto at C$11.49 in early afternoon trade on Friday. Stock in Walter Energy was up 1.9 percent at $107.63 in New York.
