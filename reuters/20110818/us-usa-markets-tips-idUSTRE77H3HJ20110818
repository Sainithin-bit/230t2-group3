 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The yield on U.S. 10-year Treasury Inflation Protected Securities turned negative on Thursday after a stunningly weak report from the Philadelphia Federal Reserve on business activity in the U.S. Mid-Atlantic region. 

 The yield on U.S. 10-year TIPS was last quoted at minus 0.10 percent, compared with 0.002 percent late on Wednesday, according to Tradeweb. The gap between 10-year TIPS yield and regular 10-year Treasuries, a measure of investors' 10-year inflation expectations, was last quoted at 2.13 percent, down 5 basis points from late on Wednesday.
