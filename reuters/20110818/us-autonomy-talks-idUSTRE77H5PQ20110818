 LONDON  (Reuters) - British software company Autonomy confirmed it is talks with Hewlett-Packard Co regarding the U.S. IT firm making a possible offer for the company. 

 "The board of Autonomy notes recent press speculation and confirms that it is in discussions with Hewlett-Packard regarding a possible offer for the company," it said in a statement on Thursday. "A further announcement will be made when appropriate." Sources said Hewlett-Packard was due to make a $10 billion approach to Autonomy ahead of announcing a long-rumored spinoff of its PC division.
