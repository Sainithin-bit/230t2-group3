 PARIS  (Reuters) - Standard & Poor's head of France said on Thursday that the agency was confident of maintaining France's AAA credit rating unchanged with a stable outlook. 

 "We are confident in this stable AAA rating," Carole Sirou told RTL radio, adding that the grade was not dependent on specific budgetary commitments but a "trajectory, a commitment."
