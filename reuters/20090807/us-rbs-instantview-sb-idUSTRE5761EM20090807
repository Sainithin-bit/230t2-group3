 LONDON  (Reuters) - British state-controlled lender Royal Bank of Scotland reported a half-year net loss of 1 billion pounds on Friday and warned results would be "poor" for the next two years, pushing its shares back 16 percent after sharp gains earlier this week. 

 Following are some analysts' reactions to the bank's results statement: LEIGH GOODWIN, FOX-PITT, KELTON "I think it's a reality check, frankly. You've had a lot of more optimism from the other two domestic UK banks. "We were hoping after the optimism of the last few days that maybe with a good performance from (RBS investment banking unit) GBM and some stabilization of credit we might be feeling that it was all a bad dream with Royal Bank. But we're back to reality." SIMON WILLIS, NCB STOCKBROKERS "The bottom line is that these results are more about the outlook statement than about the figures themselves given the extraordinary run we've had in Lloyds and RBS shares this week, which came on the back of strong increases in the previous month or so. "(RBS chief executive) Stephen Hester's words are a cold shower over the sector." SANDY CHEN, PANMURE GORDON "Overall, these results look in-line with our expectations. Management is doing the right thing in undertaking a radical restructuring of the group but it is burdened with a balance sheet built up under very different macro conditions." RICHARD HUNTER, HARGREAVES LANDSDOWN "It is difficult to draw many positives from these numbers, which even RBS management have conceded are poor. The 9 percent drop in the share price in early trade is reflective of collective disappointment as the bank's view on impairments going forward seemed at odds with that of rival Lloyds. "This week's UK banking results have shown that the sector has polarized - and RBS is not in the top tier." ROBERT LAW, NOMURA "The overall figures are significantly lower than our estimates and the tone of the statement is notably weaker than the Lloyds comments. "Our initial reaction is negative for both the shares themselves and for the sector as a whole." (Compiled by Myles Neligan; Editing by Greg Mahlich)
