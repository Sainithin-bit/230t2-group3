 (Reuters) - Futures tied to short-term U.S. interest rates rose on Wednesday after minutes of the Federal Reserve's most recent policy-setting meeting showed the central bank would likely deliver more monetary stimulus "fairly soon" unless the economy improves. 
 Traders now see the Fed first hiking rates - currently near zero - in September 2014, based on futures trading at CME Group Inc's Chicago Board of Trade. Before the minutes were released, traders had expected a hike in July 2014. (Reporting by  Ann Saphir ; Editing by  Chizu Nomiyama )
