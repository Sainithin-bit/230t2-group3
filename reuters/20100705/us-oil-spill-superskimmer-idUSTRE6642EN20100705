 NEW ORLEANS  (Reuters) - Tests on a supertanker adapted to skim large quantities of oily water from the surface of the Gulf of Mexico are inconclusive because of high seas, ship owner TMT Shipping Offshore said on Monday. 

 Tests on the so-called 'super skimmer', which if it works could greatly boost efforts to clean up the BP Plc oil spill, were supposed to be completed on Monday but have been extended because of the weather, said spokesman Bob Grantham. (Writing by  Matthew Bigg , editing by Stacey Joyce)
