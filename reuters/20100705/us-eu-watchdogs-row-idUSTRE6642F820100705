 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - EU presidency holder Belgium has intervened in a row about European financial watchdogs in an attempt to avert a breakdown in talks to set up the supervisors by the start of next year, a senior diplomat said. 

 Last weekend the country's finance minister Didier Reynders contacted his German, British and French counterparts, asking them to back a compromise and end an impasse that threatens to derail plans for the watchdogs. Setting up supervisors to keep tabs on banks, insurers and financial markets is central to Brussels' efforts to prevent a second economic crisis and delays would be an embarrassment as Washington accelerates its financial reform. But the plan is contentious with Britain, which does not want super-watchdogs that could overrule national regulators in Europe's largest financial market. The Belgians are asking countries such as Germany and Britain to agree to give the new EU regulators the final say over Berlin and London ahead of a showdown between country envoys and the European Parliament on Monday night. Diplomats fear that meeting, when parliament will again lay down demands for giving the regulators more clout, could deepen discord and make it impossible to set up the watchdogs for the self-imposed deadline of the start of 2011. "Some people in parliament feel they have been ignored," said the diplomat. "There are some who want a fight. The Belgians have taken it to the top because they have to." At the heart of the disagreement is whether the watchdogs get powers to overrule individual member states. The European Parliament, worried the new authorities will lack the teeth to enforce rules, wants them to be able to instruct local regulators on what to do in an emergency or bypass them and go straight to bank boardrooms. VETO FEARS London is standing firm, despite a plea to British finance minister George Osborne to soften his stance from Sharon Bowles, one of Britain's most prominent parliamentarians in Brussels. Bowles, who head's the influential economy committee in the European Parliament, visited Osborne last week. Berlin, which had been leaning toward Britain's position, appeared to break ranks when it recently conceded to giving the new authorities more power on condition that European countries are allowed to block their decisions. Many in parliament fear such a veto -- which could be triggered if the watchdog ruled that a country had to spend money to rescue a bank in difficulty -- would be used as a wrecking ball to render the new authorities powerless. On Monday, Michel Barnier, the European commissioner in charge of financial services, and high-ranking Belgian officials travelled to Strasbourg to persuade parliament to drop some demands, including that the authorities are based in Frankfurt. They hope lawmakers including France's Sylvie Goulard will ditch plans for a parliamentary vote this week that would cement its position, making future negotiations with countries more difficult. Both have an equal say in writing the law. Goulard told Reuters: "Our responsibility is to do our work and not only to rubber stamp the text of the governments. The crisis was severe and we just want to make sure that these new authorities can deliver." Commenting on the veto, the French lawmaker said: "We agree that the European authorities should not impinge on the national budget in an excessive way, but we cannot accept that the so-called "safeguard clause" can give any member state a veto right on European decisions." Should talks break down, it would be a setback for the European Union's push toward regulatory reform. Leaders including German chancellor Angela Merkel hoped to champion the 27-country bloc as a model of ambitious financial reform. But while Washington prepares to sign off on its new rules, they remain bogged down in disagreement. Nicolas Veron, a financial expert with think tank Bruegel, said a delay in would allow more thought to go into how the new regulators work. "What Europe is doing in terms of institutional shake-up is a much more momentous change than the U.S." (Editing by Ron Askew)
