 MELBOURNE/BANGKOK  (Reuters) - Thailand's top coal producer Banpu PCL BANP.BK agreed to buy Centennial Coal Co Ltd CEY.AX for $2 billion on Monday, gaining a long-sought Australian beachhead in Thailand's biggest overseas acquisition. 

 The deal is the first of several expected in Australia's resources sector after the government watered down plans for a big mining tax last week, with Centennial's rivals Macarthur Coal MCC.AX and Whitehaven Coal ( WHC.AX ) also seen as potential targets. Centennial investors said the offer at a 40 percent premium to Friday's close looked attractive and was unlikely to be topped by anyone else as Banpu already owns almost 20 percent of the group. "It looks like a pretty fair price they're paying. It's hard to see anyone else coming in," said Andy Forster, a portfolio manager with Argo Investments, which owns shares in Centennial. Centennial shares shot up 33 percent to A$5.87, holding below the offer price of A$6.20 a share, reflecting the view that a higher bid was unlikely. Banpu's shares rose 2 percent, outperforming the Thai market's .SETI 0.3 percent gain, by 5:30 a.m. ET. "A 40 percent premium looks like it's a little expensive, but if you look at growth opportunity Banpu is going to get in the future, it might be worth paying," said Kittichan Sirisukaracha, an analyst at Kim Eng Securities in Bangkok. Buying Centennial, which has coal reserves of about 400 million metric tons, would be a positive for Banpu's earnings and upgrades were likely to follow, Kittichan added. HAPPY HUNTING GROUND Australia has been a popular hunting ground for Asian firms seeking resources to fuel their economic growth. On Monday, Singapore's Wilmar International Ltd ( WLIL.SI ) agreed to buy CSR's ( CSR.AX ) sugar business for $1.5 billion, trumping a Chinese bid, while Anglo American Plc ( AAL.L ) sold five Australian coal fields worth a total of A$580 million to a South Korean consortium led by Korea Electric Power Corp (KEPCO). Centennial Chief Executive Bob Cameron said the end to the mining tax row helped the companies settle on an offer price, but noted there were still issues to be resolved in the new minerals resource rent tax. Banpu, through its subsidiary Banpu Minerals (Singapore), flagged it may use Centennial as a foothold for further expansion in Australia, one of its target markets for growth, alongside Indonesia and South Africa. "BMS is excited to have exposure to the Australian coal sector and believes that an acquisition of Centennial would be the initial step in driving further consolidation of the sector," BMS said in a statement. Banpu has been looking to expand in coal production offshore after exhausting local coal reserves. It is already Indonesia's fourth largest coal producer. FULL OFFER Banpu's offer was 55 percent above where Centennial was trading when Banpu first bought a 14.9 percent stake in May. It bought a further 5 percent in June on the market. The offer factored in expansion and export growth prospects for Centennial, which would come when it renegotiates its cheap coal supply agreements with its biggest customers, power generators in the state of New South Wales, both companies said. Banpu's bid is pitched at about 15.5 times forecast earnings for 2011, topping the multiple of 13.3 on U.S. coal producer Peabody Energy's ( BTU.N ) best offer for Macarthur Coal MCC.AX in April, in a three-way bid battle that ended after Canberra announced the mining tax. "They might have some view on the coal market that's very bullish that might justify that sort of a price," said Neil Boyd-Clark, a partner at Arnhem Investment Management, which does not own shares in Centennial. Banpu, led by 57-year-old Chanin Vongkusolkit, plans to fund the acquisition from cash reserves and under new and existing credit lines, and plans to keep current management in place. The deal is subject to approval from Australia's Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB), which has already approved Banpu's acquisition of a 19.9 percent stake.
