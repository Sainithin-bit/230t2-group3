 SEOUL  (Reuters) - South Korea has failed to make it into Citigroup's closely tracked World Government Bond Index (WGBI), a finance ministry official said on Monday. 

 The ministry's FX market division director, Kim Yi-tae, told Reuters it was checking on details behind the index compiler's decision and expected South Korea to be reviewed again for possible inclusion in the index in September.
