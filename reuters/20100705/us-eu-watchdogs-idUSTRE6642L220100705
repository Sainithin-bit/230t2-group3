 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - Belgium, the holder of the European Union's six-month rotating presidency, has intervened in a row about new European financial watchdogs. 

 The move is an attempt to avert a breakdown of talks to set up new EU supervisory bodies by the start of next year. Setting up the supervisors is central to the EU's attempts to prevent another crisis. But the plan is contentious with Britain, which does not want super-watchdogs that could overrule national regulators in Europe's largest financial market. Here are some key points about the new authorities: * The aim is to have three new watchdogs -- for banks, insurance companies and financial markets -- up and running by the start of next year. But a dispute in talks between country representatives and lawmakers could delay this. * The European Parliament has an equal say in finalizing the law and can insist on changes or throw it out. If a deal with countries gets delayed beyond this week, it may be impossible to launch the watchdogs in January. * The new authorities would set the bar for supervisory standards and draw up uniform rules around Europe. * They would be able to tell national supervisors, such as the Bank of England, what they should be doing to regulate. * At the heart of the row in Brussels is whether they should be given the final say over member states. * The European Parliament, worried the new authorities will lack the teeth to enforce rules, wants them to be able to instruct local regulators on what to do in an emergency. Lawmakers also want the new bodies to have the power temporarily to ban short-selling or products deemed dangerous. * Britain, home to Europe's financial capital in London, has mounted the stiffest opposition to the new authorities, trying to limit their role to drafting pan-European standards for regulation -- short of telling national regulators what to do. * France has opposed Britain, saying it thinks the new authorities should have clout to tackle rule-breakers. * Berlin, which is also skeptical about the new authorities, wants a veto for countries to overrule the watchdogs. * The European Parliament fears such a veto would be abused to render the new authorities powerless. * Some countries are also uncomfortable with demands from EU parliamentarians that all three authorities be based in Frankfurt, Germany's financial capital. * The new law will also set up a Systemic Risk Board, which will be able to demand information such as how much a troubled bank has borrowed or lent. * The board sounds its sirens if it sees threats to the financial system, like those that triggered the current crisis. * It will be able to issue warnings, saying what should be done about risks in the financial system. But it will have no binding legal power, relying rather on political pressure such as by making warnings public. * The body will effectively be an arm of the European Central Bank. Staff, including the head of its secretariat, will mostly come from the ECB. * Its chair will be elected by the board members, who are also in the ECB's Governing Council. Many observers believe this makes ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet, whose term ends in October next year, the most likely chairman. (editing by John Stonestreet)
