 SEOUL  (Reuters) - South Korean government bond prices slipped on Monday ahead of a treasury bond auction and on continued market speculation about a possible interest rate rise at a monthly rate meeting due later this week. 

 Traders showed a muted reaction to news that the country failed to be included in the Citigroup's closely tracked World Government Bond Index (WGBI). "Markets had already known that we did not make it into the index as we entered July with WGBI news," said a trader at Daishin Securities. "Now some players are in a risk-management mode ahead of the three-year treasury auction." The Finance Ministry is to sell 1.1 trillion won ($895 million) worth of three-year government bonds in an auction, and the Bank of Korea is auctioning off a combined 3.3 trillion won of monetary stabilization bonds during the day. The five-year government bond yield added one basis point to 4.40 percent, while the three-year treasury bond yield was traded at 3.79 percent, down 3 basis points. Front-end South Korean treasury futures shed 0.06 point to 110.54 as of 0049 GMT. Investors remained jittery ahead of the Bank of Korea's rate-setting meeting on July 9, when the central bank is expected to deliver its first rate increase since the 2007-2008 global financial crisis on heightened risk over inflation. On Friday, India's central bank raised interest rates almost a month earlier than expected. (Reporting by Kim Yeon-hee; Editing by Jacqueline Wong)
