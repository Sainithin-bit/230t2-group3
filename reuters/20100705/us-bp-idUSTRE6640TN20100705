 LONDON  (Reuters) - Oil company BP said it had so far spent $3.12 billion on the response effort to its Gulf of Mexico oil spill. 

 The London-based company said the sum included $147 million paid out in claims to those affected by the disaster. BP said plans are being developed for additional containment capacity and flexibility and these projects are anticipated to become operational around mid to late July.
