 (Reuters) - Deutsche Telekom's ( DTEGn.DE ) T-Mobile USA will be the first carrier to offer a mobile phone based on Google Inc's ( GOOG.O ) Android software, the New York Times reported, citing people briefed on the company's plans. 

 The high-end phone, which will be made by the world's top smartphone maker High Tech Computer Corp ( 2498.TW ), is expected to challenge Apple Inc's ( AAPL.O ) iPhone as well as other smartphones that run software from Palm Inc PALM.O, Research in Motion RIM.TO RIMM.O, Microsoft Corp ( MSFT.O ) and Nokia Oyj ( NOK1V.HE ). The phone is expected to go on sale in the U.S. before Christmas and perhaps as early as October, the paper said. Neither Google, nor T-Mobile immediately returned calls seeking comment. Last November, Google introduced its highly anticipated Android software system for designing mobile phone devices, in a move it promised could help the cellphone industry make the Internet work as smoothly on phones as it does on computers.
