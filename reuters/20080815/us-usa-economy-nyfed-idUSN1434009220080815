 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A gauge of manufacturing in New York state surprisingly rose, gaining for the first time since April although by a modest margin, the New York Federal Reserve said in a report on Friday. 

 The New York Fed's "Empire State" general business conditions index rose to 2.77 in August from minus 4.92 in July. Economists polled by Reuters had expected a reading of minus 4.4. The survey of manufacturing plants in the state is one of the earliest monthly guideposts to U.S. factory conditions. The prices paid component dipped in August to plus 65.17 from plus 77.89 in July. The survey's new orders index fell to minus 2.20 in August from plus 8.27 in July. The index gauging the number of employees was at minus 4.49 in August versus minus 6.32 in July.
