 (Reuters) - The U.S. government has asked bankrupt auto parts maker Delphi Corp to transfer more than $1.5 billion of unfunded pension obligations to former parent General Motors Corp by September 30, the New York Times said. 

 The paper, which did not specify how it obtained the information, said failing that Delphi will have to contribute more than $2 billion to the fund. It said if a deal was not reached, Delphi may have to terminate its pension fund. In a letter to GM and Delphi, the federal Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp (PBGC) warned it would lay claim to $8 billion if the automaker does not keep its pension plans intact, the paper said. This would dilute the claims of Delphi's other unsecured creditors, who are owed about $3.5 billion. Neither Delphi nor the pension agency immediately returned calls seeking comment. Delphi, which filed for bankruptcy protection in October 2005, had entered the final stages of exiting bankruptcy in April when hedge fund Appaloosa Management LP and other investors pulled out of a plan that would have provided up to $2.55 billion to support Delphi's reorganization. That left Delphi scrambling for alternatives, delaying its emergence from bankruptcy protection, and raised the cost of the reorganization process for GM. When GM spun off Delphi in 1999 it agreed to assume pension and health care obligations of thousands of Delphi employees represented by the United Auto Workers union should the supplier be unable to do so.
