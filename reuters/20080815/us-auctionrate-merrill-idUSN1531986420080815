 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - New York state on Friday threatened to sue Merrill Lynch & Co over auction-rate securities as part of its industrywide probe of banks accused of misleading investors about the debt's risks. 

 Attorney General Andrew Cuomo, who has reached settlements with five major banks to buy back more than $30 billion of the securities and pay fines of $360 million, said on a conference call with reporters that his office is "preparing to commence legal action" against Merrill. Merrill said in a statement that it was surprised by Cuomo's announcement. "We have been discussing this issue with New York and other regulators since we announced last week our plan to purchase our retail clients' ARS and we thought we were making progress," Merrill said "We anticipated further talks." Merrill had offered to buy back as much as $12 billion of the debt but has not settled with regulators. In a letter to Merrill on Friday, Cuomo's office described the buyback plan as "woefully inadequate" and short of the investor safeguards contained in settlements reached with Citigroup Inc, Swiss bank UBS AG, Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase & Co and Wachovia Corp. "We are still open to trying to resolve our investigation in a settled fashion," said the letter, signed by David Markowitz, chief of the Investor Protection Bureau, an arm of the attorney general's office. It gave Merrill five business days to explain why the attorney general should not sue. Regulators say banks misled investors into believing that auction-rate securities, which have interest rates that reset in periodic auctions, was the equivalent of cash. Much of the $330 billion ARS market has been frozen since February, when brokerages abandoned their traditional role as buyers of last resort. Cuomo told reporters that his terms for settlement were "fairly clear and established because we've done them with a number of institutions". He said his office was also investigating investment bank Goldman Sachs Group Inc and a host of other financial institutions. (Editing by John Wallace)
