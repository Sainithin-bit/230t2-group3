 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Supermarket operator Safeway Inc ( SWY.N ) said on Thursday it lowered in-store prices to a level on par with major rivals, addressing a major investor concern and sending shares up nearly 4 percent. 

 Chief Executive Steve Burd also said he expects moderate inflation in 2010, which would be a reversal from 2009 when rapidly deflating retail food prices hurt grocery profits. Shares in Safeway, which also reported on Thursday a quarterly profit in-line with expectations despite deteriorating sales and margins, had been down more than 4 percent in early trading on a day when the overall market was down on disappointing jobs data. Pleasanton, California-based Safeway, which operates the Safeway, Vons and Dominick's chains, has long battled the perception that its prices were higher than those in stores run by rivals like Kroger Co ( KR.N ) and Supervalu Inc ( SVU.N ). Jefferies & Co analyst Scott Mushkin said his own research backed the company's assertion about price parity, but he added that it will take time for shoppers' views on Safeway prices to catch up. The price comments from Safeway landed as grocers are pulling back from cut-throat price cuts that weakened profits and caused shoppers to cherry-pick the best deals last year. Whole Foods Market Inc WFMI.O, which caters to upscale shoppers with gourmet, natural and organic foods, had the biggest mountain to climb in terms of price perception. It aggressively promoted value and its own private label brand -- efforts that helped it lure back shoppers and report positive identical-store sales in the latest quarter. Prior to the recession, Safeway was targeting higher-income consumers with upscale "Lifestyle" stores that feature prepared food and broad wine selections. The strategy came back to bite the company when the economy tanked and spending on discretionary items evaporated. U.S. consumers, bruised by the worst downturn since the Great Depression, remain cautious as national unemployment hovers around 10 percent and the prospect of a brisk economic recovery dims. Nevertheless, Safeway CEO Burd said the grocer is seeing "a continued uptick in the Starbucks business" in its stores. Burd added that Safeway's premium wine sales, which were hit early and hard when consumers reeled in spending, also have stepped up. Those trends, in combination with other cues, suggest that "there seems to be a gradual improvement" in consumer confidence, Burd said on a conference call with analysts. CHARGE LEADS TO LOSS Safeway's net loss for the fourth-quarter was $1.61 billion, or $4.06 per share, after a noncash goodwill impairment charge of $1.97 billion related to a share price drop that reduced market capitalization. Excluding the charge, the company earned 53 cents per share, matching the average forecast complied by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Total sales were $12.7 billion, down 8.1 percent from a year earlier, when there was an extra week in the quarter. Identical-store fell 4.1 percent, excluding fuel. Safeway defines identical stores, a key gauge of supermarket performance, as those operating in the same period during the current and previous years. The figure does not include replacement stores. Gross profit fell 14 basis points to 28.6 percent of sales in the fourth quarter. Excluding a two basis point impact from fuel sales, gross profit dropped 16 basis points. Higher advertising spending and efforts to lower prices contributed to the margin erosion, the company said. Safeway bought back $443 million in shares during the fourth quarter. The company said it would issue its 2010 outlook during its investor conference on March 3. Shares in Safeway, which operates 1,725 stores in the United States and Canada, rose 91 cents or 3.9 percent to $24.41. (Reporting by Lisa Baertlein, editing by Gerald E. McCormick, Phil Berlowitz)
