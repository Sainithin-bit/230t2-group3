 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Below is the text of President Barack Obama's opening remarks at a summit hosted by the White House on Thursday in a last-ditch bid to salvage his stalled healthcare overhaul. 

 Good morning, everybody. Welcome. Thank you so much for participating today. I am very grateful to all of you because I know how busy you are. What I want to do is just make a few brief remarks on the front end and then we're going to allow leadership from both the House and the Senate to make some opening remarks and then we will dive in. Last year obviously was one of the toughest years we've had on record, and all of us in one way or another were devoted to focusing on breaking the back of the recession, restoring economic growth, putting people back to work. We've still got a long way to go, and so I know both the House and the Senate are interested in how do we propel economic growth forward, how do we create more jobs. I was very pleased to see a glimpse of bipartisanship in the Senate recently in passing a jobs bill, and I hope that continues, and I know there are going to be some additional pieces of legislation moving forward around, for example, making sure that small businesses can get financing. And those are the kinds of things that I think all parties and both chambers should be able to agree to. So I'm very much looking forward to working with you on all those issues. I have said repeatedly, I said at the State of the Union, I said last night when I was meeting with the Business Roundtable that in addition to dealing with the immediate challenges we face in the recovery, it's absolutely critical that we also look at some fundamental structural problems in our economy that are hurting families, hurting businesses, and having an impact on the exploding deficits and debts that the federal government, but also state governments are carrying. And it's for that reason that last year, around this time actually, I hosted in the White House a health care summit and indicated to Congress that it was absolutely critical for us to begin now moving on what is one of the biggest drags on our economy and represents one of the biggest hardships that families face. Some of you know that I get 10 letters out of the 40,000 that I receive every day for me to take upstairs to the residence and read every single night. And these are letters from all across the country, constituents from every walk of life. And I can tell you that at least two, sometimes five of the 10 letters relates to the challenges that people are experiencing in health care every single day. I'll get letters from parents who -- whose children have preexisting conditions and maybe those children were able to get health insurance when they were young, but now they're grown up, they're about to move out, and they can't get insurance no matter what job they find. I hear from small businesses who have just opened up their new rates from their insurance company and it turns out that the rates have gone up 20, 30, in some cases 35 percent. I hear from families who have hit lifetime limits, and because somebody in their family is very ill, at a certain point they have to start to dig out of pocket, and they are having to mortgage their house, and in some cases have gone bankrupt because of health care. So this is an issue that is affecting everybody. It's affecting not only those without insurance, but it's affecting those with insurance. And when you talk to every single expert and you just talk to ordinary people and you talk to businesses, everybody understands that the problem is not getting better, it's getting worse. Right now, it's projected that premiums for families with health insurance -- not people without health insurance, but with health insurance -- will almost certainly double over the next decade, just as they doubled over the past decade. In the individual markets, it's even worse. Businesses are having to make decisions about just dropping coverage altogether for their employees. If they're not doing that, then money that they are spending on health care is money that otherwise could have gone to job creation. And I don't need to tell people here about the effects on the federal budget. You know, we've got some people who have been working a very long time on figuring out how can we control the huge expansion of entitlements. Almost all of the long-term deficit and debt that we face relates to the exploding cost of Medicare and Medicaid, almost all of it. And that is -- that is the single biggest driver of our federal deficit, and if we don't get control on that, we can't get control over our federal budget. Now, I'm -- I'm telling all of you things you already know. Maybe more personally I should just mention the fact that I now have about as good health care as anybody could have. I've got a doctor right downstairs.
