 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - President Barack Obama urged Republican "soul-searching" on heathcare reform, saying if there is no progress soon toward a deal he and his fellow Democrats would have to go ahead and make decisions on how to proceed. 

 "If we saw movement, significant movement, not just gestures, then you wouldn't need to start over because everybody here knows what the issues are. And procedurally it could get done fairly quickly," Obama said, wrapping up a bipartisan summit aimed at reviving his stalled healthcare overhaul. (Reporting by  Matt Spetalnick )
