 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Lawmakers attending the White House healthcare summit appeared to agree on a number of issues confronting the U.S. healthcare system. But mainly they agreed they had fundamental differences on how to address those issues. 

 Here is a summary of the main points of agreement and disagreement. * Both Democrats and Republicans agreed the healthcare system is not working as well as it should. * Lawmakers in both parties agreed costs are too high and should be addressed. * Both sides agreed that rising healthcare costs are hurting U.S. businesses, particularly small firms. * Both sides agreed that pre-existing health conditions should not preclude people from obtaining insurance. * Both sides agreed that the insurance market needs more competition and choice. * There was also general agreement that insurers should be barred from capping annual and lifetime benefits. * All sides also agreed that there was lots of savings to be gained by reining in waste, fraud and abuse. * There was also general agreement on the need to curb "frivolous" medical malpractice lawsuits. DIFFERENCES IN APPROACH * Republicans pushed for a mostly private sector response to help fix the problems in the healthcare system, Democrats defended their bill which gives the government a bigger role. * Republicans argued that allowing people to purchase policies across state lines would inject more competition into the market and give consumers greater choices. * Democrats argued for a need for consumer protections and said their bill would allow states to form regional compacts. * Republican said mandates requiring everyone to purchase insurance are not needed. They argued that high-risk insurance pools would help people with pre-existing conditions obtain medical coverage. * Democrats said mandates are needed to keep premiums affordable if insurers are barred from excluding people for pre-existing health conditions. They argued that high risk pools would segregate the insurance market into costly coverage for the sick and old, and cheaper policies for the young and healthy. * Republicans said small businesses should be able to form national associations to help reduce insurance costs. * Democrats said their bill would create insurance exchanges for small businesses to obtain coverage. * Republicans said the proposed exchanges give too much oversight power to the Department of Health and Human Services. * Democrats said minimum coverage rules were needed to protect consumers. * Republicans said the price tag of the Democratic bill is too high and will bankrupt the country. * Democrats argued that the United States is the only industrialized nation that fails to ensure medical coverage for all of its citizens. * Republicans said Democrats were only "paying lip service" to medical malpractice reform. * Democrats said placing caps on non-economic awards was not the answer and argued in favor of incentives to states to reduce the need for lawsuits. * Republicans said Democrats should scrap their bill and start over. * Democrats argued they were willing to consider Republican ideas, but they put too much work into the bills passed by the Senate and U.S. House of Representatives to start over.
