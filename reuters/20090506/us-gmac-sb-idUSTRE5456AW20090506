 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - GMAC LLC, General Motors former finance arm, needs about $11.5 billion in new capital as a result of the government stress tests, a person familiar with the matter said on Wednesday. 

 The company is one of 19 lenders subject to government "stress tests" of their ability to weather a deep recession. Results of the tests are due on Thursday. GMAC posted its sixth loss in seven quarters on Tuesday as the weak economy caused a surge in soured auto and mortgage loans. GMAC's owners include GM and the private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management LP. (Reporting by  Paritosh Bansal , editing by Leslie Gevirtz)
