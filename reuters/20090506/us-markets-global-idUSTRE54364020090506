 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. stock and crude oil markets rallied on Wednesday as a U.S. report indicating private sector job losses in April were slowing gave investors another sign the worst of the recession may be past. 

 The gains in major U.S. stock indexes mirrored advances elsewhere in the world with the benchmark MSCI world equity index .MIWD00000PUS staying close to a 4-month high, helped by better-than-expected results from BNP Paribas and rising optimism that capital shortfalls at banks will be manageable. Currency investors took a different view, however, with the low-yielding yen, which typically strengthens when investors wish to avoid risk, rising after a source familiar with the result of a U.S. banking stress test told Reuters Bank of America ( BAC.N ) has a capital shortfall of $34 billion. Gold investors were also expressing caution, sending the price of bullion higher ahead of the release of the stress test results on Thursday. "The results that are coming tomorrow are priced in," said John Schloegel, vice president of investment strategies for Capital Cities Asset Management in Austin, Texas. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  rose 101.55 points, or 1.2 percent, to 8,512.20. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  gained 15.72 points, or 1.7 percent, to 919.53. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  rose 4.84 points, or 0.8 percent, to 1,759.10. While the capital shortfalls at 19 of the largest U.S. bank are much larger than analysts had expected, investors now have more clarity on how well the industry will cope with the most severe recession since World War II. Bank of America ( BAC.N ) shares rose 17.1 percent. Shares in Citigroup ( C.N ), which may need $5 billion according to a person familiar with the matter, rose 1.16 percent. Energy shares also gave the broad market a lift as crude rose. Chevron ( CVX.N ) gained 3.6 percent. Walt Disney Co ( DIS.N ) gained 11.8 percent after the No. 1 U.S. entertainment company posting a quarterly profit above Wall Street's forecasts on Tuesday. ADP GOOD NEWS The solid jobs data impacted several asset classes. Oil investors focused on the positive economic news, with U.S. June crude futures rising $2.42 cents to $56.26 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange as government inventory data showed gasoline stocks fell last month, adding to hopes of an economic recovery. While U.S. Treasury debt prices initially fell on the data, they later turned higher after stronger than expected demand in an auction of 10-year notes. The benchmark 10-year Treasury notes rose 2/32 at 96-19/32. Their yield, which moves inversely to their price, was at 3.15 percent, down from 3.16 percent late on Tuesday. In other regional share markets, the FTSEurofirst 300 index  .FTEU3  rose 1.4 percent on the day while emerging stocks .MSCIEF also climbed 1.5 percent. The dollar fell 0.7 percent against the yen to 98.26 yen while the euro was little changed at $1.3329. Concern about U.S. banks and uncertainty about a European Central Bank policy meeting did dull some risk appetite and boost safe haven flows into the greenback. New York gold futures rose for a third straight day on Wednesday as the stress tests on U.S. banks underscored lingering economic uncertainties, bolstering safe-haven demand in the bullion market. Gold for June delivery was up $7.50 at $911.80 on the COMEX division of the New York Mercantile Exchange.
