 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. private sector job losses slowed in April, coming in below economists' expectations, according to a report by ADP Employer Services on Wednesday. 

 KEY POINTS: * ADP National Employment Report shows U.S. employment decreased by 491,000 private sector jobs in April * ADP says April jobs loss was smallest since November 2008 * ADP says March job loss was revised to 708,000 from 742,000 COMMENTS: BRIAN KIM, CURRENCY STRATEGIST, UBS SECURITIES, STAMFORD CONNECTICUT: "The ADP report was not as weak as expected and not as weak as in recent months. Couple that with jobless claims numbers that were better than anticipated in the last couple of weeks. Euro/dollar jumped on the back of this report. Overall, this is another step on the "green shoots" argument, although it may be too early to call it a turn in the bottom. But it's definitely good to see an improvement in these numbers." MATT ESTEVE, FOREIGN EXCHANGE TRADER, TEMPUS CONSULTING  WASHINGTON DC: "The report is a lot of better than expected, although if you shake it, it still shows a loss of almost 500,000 jobs. Still, we do believe a bottom is forming in the economy and in the labor markets as well. The dollar weakness versus the euro is consistent with this move but I don't expect the euro to sustain significant gains before the ECB meeting. As for the yen, the dollar started to pare losses and I see it strengthening going forward as this report points to a better reading also on Friday with the government jobs data." DAN COOK, SENIOR MARKET ANALYST, IG MARKETS INC, CHICAGO: "Fantastic number. This is such a surprise, the best number we have seen in a long time. With everything dependent on the labor market this was a fantastic indication that maybe we are seeing a turnaround. The dollar is going to gain against the yen and right now is losing against the euro and pound. It should bring some risk back into the market." SCOTT BROWN, CHIEF ECONOMIST, RAYMOND JAMES & ASSOCIATES, ST. PETERSBURG, FLORIDA: "The ADP data is certainly not as bad as anticipated, which may lead to some encouragement that Friday's nonfarm payrolls may be not all that bad. I wouldn't be surprised to see it come in below the consensus." SUBODH KUMAR, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, SUBODH KUMAR & ASSOCIATES, TORONTO: "I think that the ADP numbers can be quite volatile. The number suggests an economy that is bottoming up, but the focus today will be on the bank stress tests. This won't make a difference to the markets. "It's too early to say if this is a good omen. This is one of many indicators that has suggested improvement, but it is volatile and is only one month. Too early to read anything further into it."
