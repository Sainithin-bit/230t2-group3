 ZURICH  (Reuters) - Adecco ( ADEN.VX ), the world's biggest staffing firm, posted an 83 percent drop in first-quarter net profit and, unlike rival Manpower, said it expects the jobs market slump to persist. 

 Profit fell to 23 million euros ($30.8 million) as recession-hit companies continued to scale back hiring. Its result beat the average estimate of 10 million euros in a Reuters poll of 10 analysts. "Visibility is very low, making it very difficult to predict when the bottom of the staffing market will be hit," Chief Financial Officer Dominik de Daniel told Reuters. Adecco and rivals Randstad ( RAND.AS ), Manpower ( MAN.N ), Michael Page ( MPI.L ) and Hays ( HAYS.L ) are facing tough times, though Manpower said recently key markets have stabilised of late. Adecco, which has already shut branches and cut jobs to protect its margins, said it expected the low demand for workers to continue in the near term and de Daniel said the company would take further steps to cut costs if necessary. The drop in revenue in April was similar to that in March, de Daniel said on a conference call, adding it was too early to tell if this easing in the pace of decline was a sign that there was light at the end of the tunnel. The group's gross margin rose 40 basis points to 18.5 percent, while its earnings before interest, tax and amortization (EBITA) margin, excluding restructuring charges, slipped 220 basis points to 2.1 percent. "The EBITA margin is better than Manpower's and Randstad's despite a slightly sharper sales decline due to faster cost reduction," though Adecco is "not exactly sharing Manpower's view of sales stabilization," said Kepler Capital Markets analyst Fabian Baumann. Adecco shares were trading up 0.3 percent at 46.32 Swiss francs at 1035 GMT (6:35 a.m. EDT), in line with the DJ Stoxx industrial goods and services index .SXNP. De Daniel said he was confident Adecco would be able to reach its EBITA margin goal of 5 percent when markets recovered thanks to the steps the company had taken to lower costs. He said it was impossible to say when the upswing would come. The pace of revenue decline accelerated in the first quarter, falling 28 percent to 3.7 billion euros, with France, the United States, Germany, Britain, Japan and Italy all posting double-digit percentage drops in revenue. TARGETS PROFESSIONAL STAFFING Adecco, which last month named Barry Callebaut ( BARN.S ) head Patrick De Maeseneire as its new chief, is seeking to increase its presence in the area of higher-margin professional staffing and de Daniel said the group was on the lookout for businesses in this area. Last year, Adecco failed in a bid to buy Michael Page, which would have boosted its position in the white-collar arena. Revenue at the group's key industrial business unit slumped 38 percent in constant currencies as manufacturers across Europe cut back on staff, while revenue in the professional business unit fell just 9 percent in constant currencies. De Daniel said the group was in a position to spend up to 1 billion euros, which includes 400 million euros in treasury shares, on acquisitions but was not under any pressure to buy. Adecco trades at 18.6-times 2010 earnings, while Randstad trades at 19.2-times. (Editing by Karen Foster and Andrew Macdonald) ($1=.7467 Euro)
