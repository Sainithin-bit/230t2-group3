 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - U.S. regional airlines, ExpressJet Holdings Inc XJT.N and SkyWest Inc ( SKYW.O ) said on Wednesday their first-quarter results were weakened by shrinking travel demand in the recession. 

 ExpressJet, which provides regional flights for Continental Airlines CAL.N, said its first-quarter net loss shrank to $11.4 million, or 67 cents per share, from a $35.7 million loss, or $6.96 a share, a year ago. Excluding items, the company posted a loss of 62 cents per share. Revenue fell 62.1 percent to $1.7 billion. ExpressJet operates more than 87 percent of its fleet through Houston-based Continental. SkyWest, which flies for Delta Air Lines ( DAL.N ) and UAL Corp's UAUA.O United Airlines, posted a smaller quarterly profit, hurt by falling travel demand and the grounding of some flights at its Atlanta hub. The company reported net income of $9.4 million or 16 cents per share, compared with a profit of $29.1 million or 47 cents per share a year ago. Revenue declined 22 percent to $673 million. The carrier warned last month that results would trail expectations after its Atlantic Southeast Airlines unit grounded 60 jets for engine inspections. The unit also experienced "significant" weather-related cancellations in Atlanta, the company said. ExpressJet shares were up 12 cents to $1.84 on the New York Stock Exchange, while SkyWest shares were up 43 cents to $13.29. (Reporting by Kyle Peterson; Editing by  Derek Caney )
