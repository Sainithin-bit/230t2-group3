 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The corporate bond market may take the results of the U.S. government's examinations of banks in stride as investors pin their hopes on economic recovery, but bank bonds could still sell off if the stress tests show the banks need surprisingly big capital infusions. 

 The results of the regulatory "stress tests" for the top 19 U.S. banks are due to be publicly disclosed on May 7. The banking system, which nearly collapsed after Lehman Brothers fell in September, is far from fixed, but there is gathering evidence that investors, emboldened by recent hints that the economy's steep decline may soon hit bottom, are venturing into riskier assets. The yield spreads of U.S. bank bonds over Treasuries had narrowed to 692 basis points as of Monday from 749 basis points two weeks ago and off peaks around 880 basis points two months ago, according to aggregate Merrill Lynch data. "The corporate bond market has experienced a terrific bounce, with the lowest rated credits (financials) having the biggest moves," said Lawrence Glazer, managing partner of Mayflower Advisors in Boston. "This has been fueled by hopes of an economic recovery," Glazer said. But he added, "the market has not yet focused on the need for additional capital or the negative consequence of the stress tests. This still leaves the door open for negative or nasty surprises." Late last year, investors shunned virtually everything except U.S. Treasuries and securities backed by government programs such as bank bonds issued with the guarantee of regulator the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. But on Tuesday, Bank of New York Mellon planned to issue debt that's not guaranteed by the U.S. government for the first time since August, joining a handful of other banks that have done so in the past few months. Now, as the shock waves from Lehman's fall grow fainter and some economic data starts to appear less dire, the government's stress tests are becoming less of a make-or-break factor for the corporate bond market, analysts said on Tuesday. The recent rally in U.S. bank bonds also reflects investors bets that the stress tests will not reveal much bigger capital needs for banks than bond markets have already priced in as well as the growing conviction that the government will not let any more systemically important banks fail. "The financial Armageddon scenario is off the table," said T.J. Marta, founder and market strategist with research firm Marta on the Markets in Scotch Plains, New Jersey. In this calmer atmosphere, investors may be prepared to overlook some analysts' criticisms that the government exams may be too easy for banks to "pass". "The market perceives the stress tests as more marketing to give people a feeling that things are being controlled," said William Larkin, portfolio manager with Cabot Money Management in Boston. Yet investors appear disposed to give the exams the benefit of the doubt, which even a week or two ago they might not have, now that there have been some signs that manufacturing and housing activity is less feeble than previously thought. "The fine tuning of capital requirements (for banks) we are doing under improving economic conditions. That is where things are looking positive," said Larkin. If investors continue plowing more money back into non-government bonds and other riskier assets which banks hold on their books, the pace of financial institutions' losses may slow, encouraging investors to start buying their debt, analysts add. Even so, over the longer term if any economic recovery is muted, stagnant activity still poses a significant threat to banks. The stress tests aim to establish how much more capital different banks will need to stay afloat as the tide of losses from housing, commercial property and consumer lending markets rises. Until the official results of the stress tests are known and the market assesses them, the risk of a selloff does remain if the exam results produce unpleasant surprises, or if investors decide that the tests themselves are not rigorous enough, as some critics maintain.
