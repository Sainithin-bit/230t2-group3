 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Bullish bets in Bank of America Corp increased on Wednesday in the options market, reflecting improved sentiment about the Charlotte-based institution's capital needs. 

 After conducting the stress test the government has told the bank it needs to add $34 billion capital, but investors were expecting either a need for even more money, or that it would have to convert preferred shareholder stakes into common shares. Many of the largest U.S. banking institutions also have been ordered to raise billions in capital to shore up their balance sheets. Bank of America shares rose 16.7 percent to $12.65 in afternoon trade. "Even today's potentially bearish news on the bank's capital adequacy has not managed to deter investors from jumping onto its shares and bullish call options," said Andrew Wilkinson, senior market analyst at Connecticut-based Interactive Brokers Group. About 1.35 million option contracts traded in Bank of America, dominated by 871,000 calls, which give the buyer the privilege to purchase shares at a fixed price and time. The combined volume in afternoon trade was double the norm, according to option analytics firm Trade Alert. The May $12.50 call strike was the most actively traded equity option in the market, Trade Alert data shows. More than 146,415 contracts traded in that strike just below its existing positions of 146,838 lots as investors reacted to the sharp rise in the bank's share price, said Frederic Ruffy, option strategist at WhatsTrading.com. Some investors are buying call options while some others are taking profits, he said. Those calls were active as the bank's shares surged right up to that strike price. The majority of them earlier in the session were bought on the view that the shares will extend gains after the stress tests, said Jon Najarian, a founder of Web information site optionMonster.com. Overall, banking shares have rallied sharply on Wednesday, with the KBW Bank index rising 12.2 percent. As bank shares have rallied in the last two months, short interest has also risen as investors have grown skeptical of the sharp move higher by these stocks. However, with the economic outlook improving and what seems to be a better-than-expected outcome on the stress tests, those shares have continued to rise, hurting those making short bets. "The shorts have very little legs to stand on anymore," said Chris Wang, portfolio manager at hedge fund SYW Capital Management LLC, who owns shares of Bank of America and Citigroup. The percentage of shares on loan outstanding has risen to 5 percent as of Tuesday from 3 percent on April 24, according to New York-based DataExplorers. Short interest has steadily climbed in recent weeks in expectation that Bank of America could be forced to convert preferred shares to common stock. When Citigroup announced plans for a conversion of preferred stock to common stock in late February, numerous fund managers sold common stock short and bought the preferred shares to attempt to take advantage of the conversion -- but ended up losing money when the common shares soared and the gains were not matched by similar rallies in preferred shares.
