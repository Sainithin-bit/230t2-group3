 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Cisco Systems Inc ( CSCO.O ) Chief Executive John Chambers said on Wednesday that he was more comfortable than ever with the company's long-term growth target despite the double-digit fall in revenue last quarter. 

 The world's largest network equipment maker is targeting annual revenue growth in a range of 12 percent to 17 percent in the long term, even though sales fell 17 percent in the quarter ended April 25 due to slower technology spending. "I'm as comfortable or probably more comfortable than ever about that target," he told Reuters in an interview on Wednesday, adding that customers were seeing more stability in business conditions. "You can call it stability, you can call it leveling out... for the first time many of them feel something solid beneath their feet as opposed to going into deeper and deeper water," he said.
