 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Network equipment maker Cisco Systems Inc on Wednesday posted a 17 percent dive in quarterly revenue as corporations slashed technology spending, but profit trumped Wall Street's expectations. 

 Its shares gained more than 4 percent after hours. COMMENTARY: BARRY JARUZELSKI, VICE PRESIDENT, BOOZ & CO "It was slightly better than expectations. The consensus was about 18 percent down on the revenue line and they came in about 17 percent, so I don't think there was anything terribly shocking. "They are not immune from the contraction in the enterprise IT arena and the retrenchment of enterprise spending clearly continued through the end of April. But they've managed to maintain a fairly tight operation. Their days' sales outstanding actually improved in terms of receivables and they only had a slight decrease in inventory turns, still around 11, which is still outstanding levels of operations performance. "So they're obviously continuing to run a very tight operational ship. They have an increasing cash balance so they are in good stead, but the market continues to be extremely challenging. "There isn't any info here on what the (revenue) mix was. Given the overall market and the contraction of enterprise, its strong performance shows they continue to run a tight ship operationally. "What you really want to see on the call is what is the mix, either geographically or by product set. Was there better or worse performance in routers versus the new server business? See where the points of strength are, because the release doesn't shine any light on what was the mix to get to that $8.2 billion." MARK SUE, ANALYST, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS Sue said the upcoming executives' teleconference and guidance will be key. "A good beat on the bottom line, shows strong operational excellence. "The view is that revenues were a little better. "But so far, they've checked off a lot of the boxes going into the evening." TIM GHRISKEY, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, SOLARIS ASSET MANAGEMENT, NEW YORK "Well the numbers were sure good. Cisco positively surprised on earnings by a significant margin and unlike a lot of other companies we've seen this quarter, they also surprised on revenues. I think that's why the stock is reacting so favorably in the after-market. "Big-cap tech was actually the worst-performing sector in the market today and we think that was because of fears that Cisco might disappoint in earnings and we've seen just the opposite here. Most likely we're in for a good start for the day tomorrow, especially in technology. "Clearly this market rally has more legs. But we will get more details about banks tomorrow and their capital ratios with the stress test. But that really hasn't been an overhang on this market at all as financials were the strongest sector in the market today. "Certainly a good post-market here, stocks overall reacting positively, Cisco's up nicely on these very strong earnings."
