 HANOVER, Germany  (Reuters) - Continental AG ( CONG.DE ) is on track for another year of record earnings as it streamlines its portfolio and integrates its newly acquired VDO business, the world's fifth-largest automotive supplier said. 

 "The facts and figures for the first quarter of this year clearly demonstrate that we're right on course for achieving the goals I mentioned for 2008," Chief Executive Manfred Wennemer told the company's annual shareholder meeting. Continental will report first-quarter earnings on Tuesday. Continental's competitor French car parts group Valeo ( VLOF.PA ) posted a forecast-beating 21.6 percent rise in first quarter operating profit on Friday despite a weaker automotive market, sending its shares up more than 6 percent. Continental shares rose 2.6 percent to 78.47 euros by 1443 GMT, outperforming a 1.5 percent rise in Germany's blue-chip DAX index  .GDAXI  and roughly in line with a 2.8 percent rise in the DJ Stoxx European automotive index .SXAP. Continental expects full-year sales of more than 26.4 billion euros and a consolidated EBIT (earnings before interest and tax) margin of more than 9.3 percent before amortization relating to the purchase of the VDO automotive electronics business and before integration and restructuring expenses. Based on 5 percent organic growth annually without further acquisitions, Continental estimates sales of more than 30 billion euros in 2011 with earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) of 3 billion euros. RISING PRICES Continental bought VDO from Siemens ( SIEGn.DE ) last July for 11.4 billion euros to strengthen its electronics portfolio and complement the business with advanced fuel injection systems. The deal also helped shelter the company from the impact of rising prices for natural rubber, steel cords and petroleum by-products such as carbon black. Nonetheless, Chief Financial Officer Alan Hippe said he could not rule out raising prices at its tire division due to higher raw material prices. Hippe became the new head of the group's passenger car tire division and will remain CFO until a successor is found. French tire maker Michelin ( MICP.PA ) kicked off a fresh round of price rises in Europe recently, followed swiftly by Italy's Pirelli ( PECI.MI ), which made a failed attempt to acquire Continental in the early 1990s. REDUCING DEBT TOP PRIORITY While reducing debt had priority for Continental this year, it said it aimed to strengthen its two tire businesses and its ContiTech rubber parts unit with acquisitions in North and South America and Asia, although there were no concrete plans yet. Continental plans to make 20 to 25 percent of overall sales in Asia by 2015, from 8 percent at present and with currently 21 percent of sales in the NAFTA region. In a move to streamline its business Continental sold its electric motor device and cooling fan businesses to German rival Brose and plans to sell its fuel supply business unit, for which there were interested parties but no concrete negotiations under way yet, it said. A sale of its truck tire business was currently not planned, Wennemer said. Recent turbulences on global financial markets slashed Continental's market capitalization by a third since mid 2007 and spoiled plans for 1.5 billion euros hybrid bond, which may threaten its credit rating. But Continental's Hippe said the bond may still be issued in 2008 if market conditions improved. (Editing by  Louise Ireland )
