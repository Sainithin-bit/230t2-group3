 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Wachovia Bank agreed to pay as much as $144 million to settle allegations it failed to help consumers who fell prey to schemes operated by telemarketers that maintained accounts at the bank, regulators said on Friday. 

 The bank, the country's fourth largest, agreed to pay $18.9 million as part of a consent order, including a $10 million civil penalty and $8.9 million for consumer education programs, according to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. The OCC said bank officials were aware of what was going on as well as profits for the bank, but failed to take quick action. Potential claims by thousands of consumers, including many elderly, could be as much as $125 million, the OCC said in a statement, but the actual claims could fall short of that amount. Many of the consumers hurt by third-party telemarketers and payment processors have already been reimbursed by those companies, the bank regulator said. Wachovia Corp's WB.N bank was under investigation by bank regulators for 18 months over its relationships with payment processors and telemarketers that obtained bank information from consumers who were offered questionable products and services, including medical discount plans and travel vouchers. The telemarketers, which maintained accounts at Wachovia, used information obtained from the consumers to create checks that were deposited without the approval of the individuals. Rep Edward Markey, a senior member on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, said the settlement shortchanges elderly fraud victims because only a fraction of the victims might be reimbursed. "The settlement's requirement for victims to file claims in order to be reimbursed may prove to be too high a barrier to surmount for many in the elderly population that was the target of this fraud," the Massachusetts Democrat said. The telemarketers involved were Payment Processing Center, LLC; FTN Promotions Inc, which also is known as Suntasia Inc; Netchex Corp; Your Money Access LLC, and related companies. In July 2007, the Federal Trade Commission accused Suntasia of operating a "massive telemarketing scam" that defrauded U.S. consumers out of tens or even hundreds of millions of dollars. Wachovia shares closed 5.2 percent higher at $28.81 on Friday on the New York Stock Exchange. Wachovia said the situation was unacceptable. It did not admit or deny any wrongdoing in settling the matter with its regulator. "We regret it happened," Wachovia spokeswoman Christy Phillips-Brown said. "We will work diligently to provide restitution to consumers affected by the situation, and to educate consumers. We're pleased to have resolved this matter with the OCC." "The bank failed to take quick action to terminate these account relationships or otherwise correct the problem," the OCC said. Regulators said Wachovia is required to develop new policies and procedures when dealing with those checks, payment processors for telemarketers and telemarketers. The case prompted the OCC to issue updated guidance to national banks involving telemarketers and other merchants.
