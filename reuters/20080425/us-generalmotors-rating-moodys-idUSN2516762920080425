 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Moody's Investors Service on Friday changed its outlook on General Motors Corp ( GM.N ) to negative from stable, citing concerns about finance unit GMAC's ability to help fund purchases of GM's vehicles. 

 A negative outlook indicates GM's rating is more likely to be cut over the next 12 to 18 months. GM is rated "B3," six steps below investment grade. GMAC, which is 49 percent owned by GM, may be stretched to provide funds for consumers to buy GM vehicles as it becomes increasingly capital-constrained from needing to support its ailing mortgage unit Residential Capital LLC, Moody's said. "GMAC has always filled a critical role in supporting GM's retail sales, and anything that lessens its ability to provide that support is a negative for GM," Moody's analyst Bruce Clark said in a statement. "We think that one of the trade-offs for GMAC's potential support of ResCap is an erosion in its ability to support GM's retail sales." In February, GMAC posted a $724 million fourth-quarter loss, pulled down by a $921 million loss at ResCap, which recorded its fifth straight quarterly loss. In order for ResCap to have continued access to debt capital, GMAC may be required to provide additional capital support for the unit, Moody's said. "This support, however, could weaken GMAC's own credit profile and limit its ability to access the secured and unsecured debt markets," Moody's said.
