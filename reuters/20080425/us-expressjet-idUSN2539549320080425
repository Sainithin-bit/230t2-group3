 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - ExpressJet Holdings Inc XJT.N said on Friday it rejected a $181.5 million takeover bid from SkyWest Inc ( SKYW.O ) and has begun began a review of strategic alternatives, including talks with SkyWest for a higher price. 

 SkyWest offered to pay $3.50 a share for ExpressJet, representing a premium of 67.5 percent to ExpressJet's closing price of $2.09 on Thursday. The value of the deal is based on 51.9 million shares outstanding as of March 10, according to Reuters data. ExpressJet said it had formed a special committee of independent outside members of its board of directors to evaluate the proposal. The committee decided the fair value of ExpressJet stock was "substantially higher" than $3.50 and that SkyWest's proposal did not deliver the value of synergies between to the two carriers to its shareholders. The committee will now conduct a strategic review, which will include talks with SkyWest and other interested parties to evaluate a merger at a higher price, as well as talks with Continental Airlines Inc CAL.N for a new capacity purchase agreement. ExpressJet began flying under its own brand last year to put a quarter of its fleet to use after former parent Continental canceled a capacity purchase agreement. ExpressJet, which flies regional service for Continental and Delta Air Lines ( DAL.N ), also started a chartered service. SkyWest Inc owns SkyWest Airlines and Atlantic Southeast Airlines. ExpressJet shares were up 84 cents to $2.93 in morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange. SkyWest shares were up 2 cents to $17.18 on the Nasdaq.
