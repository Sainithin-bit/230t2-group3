 TOKYO/LONDON  (Reuters) - Investors rushed to bet on higher interest rates on Friday, dumping bonds in the belief that leading central banks were switching from nursing economies hobbled by a credit crisis to battling inflation. 

 The main Japanese bond futures contract suffered its biggest daily fall in five years, forcing the Tokyo Stock Exchange to call a trading halt for the first time ever. In Europe, the contract resumed weaker than in London on Thursday. At the 1500 GMT close, the JGB contract was at 135.35, down 32 ticks on the day. The effects were felt by other fixed income assets too. Euro zone government bonds initially fell on Friday and U.S. Treasuries took a hit in Asia and Europe. Investors' anxiety centered on the fact that a major economy which had for years experienced low inflation was beginning to feel the pinch of rising prices. "Inflation has not been a problem in Japan for many years now and given that inflation is even reaching that part of the world, then it does really bring into focus how big a problem inflation could be potentially going forward," said Orlando Green, fixed income strategist at Calyon. "That's really going to hurt the long-end on the bond curve in the medium term, so that's a big issue for the market." However, most of Friday's selling was in short-dated paper. European observers said JGB prices had probably found a floor and Japanese interest rates were not headed up to counter price inflation. "The CPI numbers were the straw that broke the camel's back and led to a spectacular collapse by Japanese bonds today. But judging by the long list of subdued data Japan has had, I don't think the authorities are going to hike interest rates anytime soon," said Marc Ostwald, a bond analyst at Insinger de Beaufort in London. "Rates aren't moving, except down." Although the Tokyo bond rout followed news that inflation in Japan had hit a decade peak, expectations of higher rates had been building for days on signs the global economy had seen off the worst of the turmoil ignited by U.S. mortgage defaults. The biggest shift in outlook has come with the Federal Reserve, which has slashed interest rates by 3 percentage points since September to cushion the U.S. economy from the fallout of the credit crisis. The Fed is now expected to keep interest rates on hold after a quarter-point trim to 2 percent next week and perhaps tweak the language of its post-meeting statement to reflect that it may be nearly finished after chopping rates from 5.25 percent. Just a month ago, investors were looking for the Fed to cut rates as low as 1 percent to help revive the economy. There has also been speculation this week that the European Central Bank could raise rates from 4.0 percent after euro zone inflation hit a record high, drawing warnings on price pressures from ECB policymakers. AUSTRALIAN INFLATION In Australia, markets awoke to the possibility that the central bank could lift rates for a third time this year after data showed core inflation accelerating at the fastest pace in 17 years and well beyond the Reserve Bank's target.  Japan's Nikkei average jumped 2.4 percent  .N225  to a two-month high, reflecting the rising confidence among investors that the worst may be over rather than fears about inflation.  The panic about the financial fallout from the U.S. subprime mortgage crisis peaked in mid-March when U.S. investment bank Bear Stearns collapsed and was taken over by JPMorgan Chase. Since then quarterly earnings of Citigroup Inc and other financial institutions have stirred hopes that banks have tackled the worst of their asset write-downs. Central banks have come up with an array of devices to keep money flowing through the pipes of the financial system, including a 50 billion pound Bank of England plan to allow banks to swap mortgage assets for government bonds temporarily. Now investors are questioning their assumptions about interest rates as global inflation rises and the U.S. economy shows signs it is more resilient than initially thought. The jump in short-term bond yields in the United States as well as Japan provided the clearest signal yet that investors believe central banks are focusing more on containing inflation than fostering growth. The two-year U.S. Treasury yield, the most sensitive to the policy outlook, reached a high of 2.51 percent on Friday -- taking it to 26 basis points above the current fed funds target, the most since June 2006.  In Japan, two-year government bond yields shot up as much as 13 basis points to 0.850 percent -- well above the BOJ's 0.5 percent target as the next move is seen as a rate hike instead of a rate cut. Euro zone two-year yields are up a full percentage point from their lows hit in March.
