 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Coventry Health Care Inc CVH.N posted a 3 percent first-quarter profit increase on Friday, matching Wall Street estimates, helped by higher membership, and the insurer backed its full-year forecast. 

 Coventry shares rose more than 2 percent, and the report lifted shares of other health-insurer stocks. The results follow a mostly gloomy first-quarter reporting season for large U.S. health insurers, whose shares have been battered amid profit warnings and fears of a downturn. "Coventry revealed a solid quarter despite a challenging operating environment," said Stifel Nicolaus analyst Thomas Carroll, who recommends holding the shares. Analysts and investors are divided over whether health insurers have sought enrollment gains at the expense of lowering their pricing and sacrificing profit margins. "It makes no economic sense to chase market share at the expense of pricing discipline," Coventry Chief Executive Officer Dale Wolf said on a conference call with analysts. "I'm reasonably confident that that's understood across the industry, but I'm absolutely certain that it's understood at Coventry," Wolf said. First-quarter net earnings rose to $125 million, or 81 cents per share, from $121.7 million, or 76 cents per share, a year ago. The latest results matched analysts' expectations, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue jumped 31 percent to $2.94 billion, helped by acquisitions. Membership stood at 4.68 million at the end of the quarter, up 14 percent from a year ago, but only slightly higher than the end of 2007. From the end of 2007, the company increased membership in its Medicare plans for the elderly, which comprise about a third of its overall revenue. But over that time, Coventry saw declines in its commercial plans for employers for which Coventry assumes insurance risk. Coventry's medical loss ratio, the percent of premiums spent on medical costs, worsened to 82.5 percent from 81.9 percent a year ago. However, it came in better than the 83.3 percent expected by analysts at JP Morgan. Bethesda, Maryland-based Coventry forecast second-quarter earnings of $1.03 to $1.04 per share. Analysts had expected $1.10. However, the company said analyst estimates were too low for its fourth quarter, generally making up for the difference for the second quarter. It continued to predict full-year earnings of $4.39 to $4.50 per share. Analysts looked for $4.43. In March, Coventry cut its 2008 forecast, citing the impact of the flu on medical costs and pressure on net investment income, but expressed confidence in all of its business lines. Earlier this week, UnitedHealth Group Inc ( UNH.N ) and WellPoint Inc ( WLP.N ) posted disappointing quarterly results and cut their 2008 outlooks. Aetna ( AET.N ) met Wall Street's expectations and reaffirmed its full-year forecast, although its second-quarter outlook was weaker than expected. Coventry shares rose $1.33, or 3.09 percent, to $44.33 in early afternoon trade on the New York Stock Exchange. The shares have fallen 26 percent this year, outperforming a 33 percent drop for the Morgan Stanley Healthcare Payor index  .HMO.
