 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Yahoo! Inc said on Friday it expects to incur pre-tax cash charges of about $29 million for expenses related to a work force reduction disclosed on February 15, 2008. 

 The charges are offset by a $12 million credit related to stock-based compensation expense reversals, it said. It recognized $29 million of the severance pay expenses and related cash expenditures in the first quarter of 2008. (Reporting by  Dane Hamilton ; Editing by  Andre Grenon )
