 LONDON  (Reuters) - A British Airways test flight, carrying five people including BA Chief Executive Willie Walsh, encountered no difficulties, the airline said on Sunday. 

 The Boeing 737 took off from London's Heathrow airport shortly before 8 p.m. EDT and stayed at 40,000 feet for an hour, before flying over Ireland and landing in Cardiff at 1941 GMT after volcanic ash turned much of Europe into a no-fly zone. "The conditions were perfect and the aircraft encountered no difficulties. It will now undergo a full technical analysis at British Airways' engineering base at Cardiff," the airline said in a statement. (Reporting by  Caroline Copley ; Editing by  Alison Williams )
