 AMSTERDAM  (Reuters) - The Dutch airline KLM said most European airspace was safe on Sunday, as its government urged a more flexible approach to the volcanic ash cloud that has prompted a flight ban across most of the continent. 

 KLM said inspections after it conducted nine test flights showed no damage to engines or evidence of dangerous ash concentrations. Its chief executive, Peter Hartman, was quoted by the Dutch ANP news agency as saying European airspace was safe "with the exception of an area in the north between Iceland and Russia." Pressure is mounting on aviation authorities from the main associations of European airports and airlines, who are calling for a reassessment of restrictions that are costing airlines hundreds of millions of dollars, and have stranded millions of travelers. Italy and Austria said they would reopen affected airports on Monday, and European Union transport ministers will hold a video conference on Monday to consider whether the restrictions could be eased more broadly. Dutch authorities cleared two KLM cargo planes to take off for Sharjah and Bangkok on Sunday night. Dutch airspace remained closed for passenger flights, but the Transport Ministry said it was looking at ways to allow more flights. It said Dutch Transport Minister Camiel Eurlings would press fellow EU ministers to allow more differentiation between areas with a high and low concentration of ash. KLM CEO Hartman expressed hope that passenger flights could start again on Monday, the public broadcaster NOS reported. ANP quoted him as Hartman as saying that if airspace was reopened, it would take about a week before operations returned to normal. (Writing by  Aaron Gray-Block ; Editing by  Kevin Liffey )
