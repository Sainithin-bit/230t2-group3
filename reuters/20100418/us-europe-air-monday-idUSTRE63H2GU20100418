 LONDON  (Reuters) - British airspace will be closed to flights until at least 9 p.m. EDT on Monday because of the danger posed by clouds of volcanic ash from Iceland, UK aviation officials said on Sunday. 

 The air traffic body NATS said it would continue to review weather information and would issue an update around 5 a.m. EDT Monday. (Reporting by  Tim Castle )
