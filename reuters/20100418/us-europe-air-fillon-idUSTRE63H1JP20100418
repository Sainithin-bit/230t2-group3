 PARIS  (Reuters) - French airports north of a line between Nice and Bordeaux will remain closed until at least Tuesday morning, Prime Minister Francois Fillon said on Sunday. 

 He said after a crisis meeting with some ministers that the situation due to a cloud of ash from a volcano in Iceland would remain difficult in the days to come. The opening of some airports in the south of the country and the rerouting of some flights to these airports "may allow for the repatriation of the largest possible number of our stranded citizens," he said in televised remarks.
