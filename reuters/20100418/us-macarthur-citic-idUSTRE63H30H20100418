 MELBOURNE  (Reuters) - CITIC Resources ( 1205.HK ), the largest shareholder in takeover target Macarthur Coal MCC.AX, has not yet decided whether to support a $3.8 billion bid for the Australian miner from Peabody Energy ( BTU.N ), Macarthur said on Monday. 

 CITIC Resources, which owns 22.4 percent of Macarthur, said it continues to support the rationale for Macarthur's rival plan to take over Gloucester Coal GCL.AX, which would give Hong Kong-based Noble Group ( NOBG.SI ) a near one-quarter stake in Macarthur. Peabody bid A$16 a share last week, topping an offer from Macarthur's local rival New Hope Corp ( NHC.AX ). (Reporting by  Sonali Paul ; Editing by  Balazs Koranyi )
