 VIENNA  (Reuters) - Austria's airports are expected to reopen for flights from 7 a.m. EDT on Monday, aviation authorities said on Sunday. 

 "From the current standpoint, services from all Austrian airports can resume from Monday 6 a.m. (7 a.m. EDT)," Austro Control said in a statement. It said it could close airspace again, depending on the movement of the cloud of ash spreading from an Icelandic volcano. (Reporting by  Sylvia Westall , Editing by Alison Williams)
