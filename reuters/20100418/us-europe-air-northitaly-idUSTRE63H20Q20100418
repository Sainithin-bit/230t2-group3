 ROME  (Reuters) - Italy's civil aviation authority ENAC said it would reopen the country's northern airspace from 7 a.m. local (9 a.m. EDT) on Monday as weather forecasts showed the volcanic ash cloud from Iceland moving away from the area. 

 ENAC had previously said it would maintain the no-fly zone over northern Italy until at least 8 a.m. local (10 a.m. EDt) on Monday.
