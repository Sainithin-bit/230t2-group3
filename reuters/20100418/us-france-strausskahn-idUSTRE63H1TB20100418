 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the French Socialist politician heading the International Monetary Fund, on Sunday sidestepped questions about whether he may seek to run in France's 2012 presidential election, saying only he was happy with his current job. 

 "I'm happy with what I'm doing," he said in an interview on CNN's "Fareed Zakaria GPS" program. "It is important for the global economy to have those kinds of institutions working well. I have no other projects," he added. The former French economy minister has seen his popularity surge in France since becoming head of the Washington-based IMF in 2007, often traveling to Paris and maintaining a high public profile in the French media. His term at the IMF expires in October 2012, several months after the election, which means he could have to quit ahead of time if he wanted to challenge President Nicolas Sarkozy. Speculation has increased in recent months that he could re-enter active politics as Sarkozy's ratings have sunk to record lows. Concern in France about high unemployment, a widening gap between rich and poor, rapidly growing public debt, security and immigration have combined to give Socialists new optimism ahead of the 2012 ballot. Strauss-Kahn would have to win the backing of Socialist supporters to become their party's candidate in the 2012 vote. Asked whether he would consider re-entering French politics once his IMF term runs out, Strauss-Kahn joked: "Maybe I will stay in the IMF for years and years and years, who knows." He also dodged questions when asked what advice he could give the Socialists in the run-up to the election, saying: "I won't give any kind of advice." As head of the IMF he has to be seen as a neutral player and not involved in politics in France or elsewhere. (Reporting by  Lesley Wroughton ; editing by Paul Simao)
