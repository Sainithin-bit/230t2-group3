 COPENHAGEN  (Reuters) - Denmark will keep its airspace closed until 3 p.m. EDT Monday because of the volcanic ash cloud from Iceland, Danish air traffic controller Naviair said. 

 Naviair said it would issue an update on the forecast around 10 a.m. EDT Monday. Copenhagen airport and the entire Danish airspace have been closed since Thursday afternoon. (Reporting by Anna Ringstrom)
