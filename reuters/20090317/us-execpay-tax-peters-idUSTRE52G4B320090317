 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - A Democratic U.S. congressman said on Tuesday he has introduced a bill that would slap a 60 percent surtax on large bonuses to be paid to executives at bailed-out insurer American International Group Inc ( AIG.N ). 

 Michigan Democratic Rep. Gary Peters introduced the bill and has picked up five co-sponsors. He said in a statement that the bill would "create a 60 percent surtax on bonuses over $10,000 to any company in which the U.S. government has a 79 percent or greater equity stake in the company. Currently, AIG is the only company that meets this threshold." (Reporting by  Kevin Drawbaugh ; Editing by Leslie Adler)
