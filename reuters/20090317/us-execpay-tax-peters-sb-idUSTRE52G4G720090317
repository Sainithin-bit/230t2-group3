 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - A U.S. House of Representatives bill would slap a 60 percent surtax on large bonuses to be paid to executives at bailed-out insurer American International Group Inc. 

 Michigan Democratic Rep. Gary Peters drew up the bill and has picked up five co-sponsors, with other lawmakers voicing support on Tuesday for taxing the bonuses that President Barack Obama on Monday termed an "outrage." Peters said his bill would create a 60 percent surtax on bonuses over $10,000 at any company where the U.S. government has an equity stake of 79 percent or more in the company. "Currently, AIG is the only company that meets this threshold," Peters said in a statement. "The legislation I'm proposing will get taxpayers their money back. "It is beyond outrageous that the very people who brought AIG to its knees and helped create the current financial crisis are scheduled to receive hundreds of millions of dollars in bonuses while tax dollars keep their company afloat," he said. California Democratic Rep. Brad Sherman, a member of the House Financial Services Committee along with Peters, said on Tuesday that he wants to work with colleagues "on a tax law to impose a substantial surtax on excessive compensation paid to executives at bailed-out firms, especially AIG."
