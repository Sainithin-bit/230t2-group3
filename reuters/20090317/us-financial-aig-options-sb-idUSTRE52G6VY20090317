 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Tuesday lawmakers were weighing three options for recouping taxpayer dollars like the $165 million in bonuses to American International Group Inc. employees. 

 Options being considered include authorizing the U.S. attorney general to try to recover excessive compensation payments at firms like AIG which received government bailout assistance as well as clamping down on retention bonuses such firms pay out, Pelosi said in a statement. A third option, which has been widely discussed, would be using special tax legislation to recover "a substantial portion" of the bonuses, the statement said.
