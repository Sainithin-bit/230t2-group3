 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The White House said on Tuesday it was considering a variety of ways to retrieve millions of dollars paid out in bonuses to employees of American International Group Inc. 

 "Obviously, the president is committed to working as quickly as possible with Congress to find ways to recoup this money," White House spokesman Robert Gibbs told reporters. Gibbs said that would include a range of ideas, "whether it's changing the tax code or whatever ideas" are raised in Congress. New York Democratic Senator Charles Schumer of New York and other lawmakers have suggested that one way to get the money back might be to impose a massive tax bill on those receiving the bonuses. Democratic Representative Barney Frank, chairman of the House of Representatives Financial Services Committee, said the government should use its position as majority stakeholder in AIG to sue the company. Gibbs said he would need to consult the White House legal team to find out  whether the administration thought that approach would work. (Reporting by  Caren Bohan ; Editing by  Jackie Frank )
