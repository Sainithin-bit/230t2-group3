 HELSINKI  (Reuters) - The world's top mobile phone maker, Nokia, said on Tuesday it would slash 1,700 jobs globally over the coming few months due to falling demand. 

 The overall cell phone market is expected to contract roughly 10 percent this year, hurt as consumers rein in spending and handset sellers try to clear out unsold phones. The following is a list of recent job and cost cut announcements from Nokia and its telecom equipment gear unit Nokia Siemens Networks (NSN). Nokia had some 61,500 staff at end-December, NSN had 60,300. NOVEMBER 4, 2008 Nokia said it would cut more than 600 jobs, with 450 coming in its markets unit, 130 at its research center, and some 35 elsewhere. Nokia also said it would shut an office in Turku, western Finland, and relocate the 220 staff to other Finnish sites. NOVEMBER 11, 2008 NSN said it would cut around 1,820 jobs, mostly in Finland and Germany, citing challenging market conditions. The announcement was the last part of its 2-billion-euro ($2.60 billion) cost cut program. The firm said it aimed to cut up to 750 jobs in Finland and close one of its sites employing 500 staff in Munich. It said it would sell a manufacturing site in Durach, Germany -- which employs some 500 employees -- to management there. JANUARY 22, 2009 In its fourth-quarter 2008 result, Nokia said it would look to slash costs at its Devices and Services businesses to under six billion euros by the end of 2010, meaning a cut of more than 700 million from end-2008 levels. Nokia said the majority of the reductions should happen in 2009. FEBRUARY 11, 2009 Nokia said it would close a research site in the Finnish town of Jyvaskyla, affecting 320 jobs. It said it would cut 90 jobs elsewhere, and temporarily lay off all of the 2,500 staff at its Salo plant, on a rotational basis. FEBRUARY 24, 2009 Nokia said it would offer a severance package to the first 1,000 employees worldwide who volunteer to leave, seeking to avoid further layoffs. MARCH 17, 2009 Nokia unveils 1,700 more job cuts. It says jobs will go in its Devices and Markets units, Corporate Development Office and global support functions. Nokia adds it will scale back sales, marketing and technology management to match its pruned phone portfolio and weaker global consumer demand, reduce marketing and other activities, and streamline its Devices R&D.
