 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The U.S. government should use its position as majority stakeholder to sue American International Group Inc and recoup millions of dollars of bonuses paid to employees, the chairman of the House of Representatives Financial Services Committee said on Tuesday. 

 Representative Barney Frank also told reporters the government should not risk discouraging foreign investment by only paying AIG's counterparty obligations to U.S. entities. "I think we should be suing to get the bonuses back as the owner (of AIG)," Frank said. "I think it's time for us to exercise our ownership rights." AIG, which is being kept alive on a government bailout of up to $180 billion, is paying out $165 million in bonuses to employees. Word of the bonuses has touched off a firestorm of criticism in Congress and from the Obama administration. The government owns an 80 percent stake in the giant insurer. Frank, a Democrat, said he was skeptical about the argument that bonuses are needed to retain valuable AIG employees. "It is hardly a tough market for hiring people with financial expertise," he said. (Reporting by  Karey Wutkowski  and  Julie Vorman ; editing by John Wallace)
