 LUXEMBOURG  (Reuters) - Luxembourg said on Tuesday it would seek an out-of-court deal to end a legal row about money which investors lost to Bernard Madoff that has hit UBS ( UBSN.VX ) ( UBS.N ) and is damaging the country's reputation as a financial center. 

 Some wealthy individuals lost money after having invested in Luxalpha, a Luxembourg-based fund set up at their request by Swiss bank giant UBS. The fund was holding around $1.4 billion of assets, sources familiar with the issue have told Reuters. "I would encourage all parties involved to sit around a table and look for an extra-judiciary solution," Luxembourg Treasury Minister Luc Frieden told the Reuters Funds Summit. Frieden said the court proceedings were taking too long. He said he would contact UBS in the coming days. "It is always negative if court cases take a long time," Frieden said. "It would be in the best interest of all parties if rather than having numerous court cases they would sit around a table." Minority shareholder activist group Deminor is helping clients to recover some of the money lost to investment in products offered by Madoff, a former Nasdaq chairman who has admitted to 11 criminal charges in Wall Street's biggest fraud, which drew in as much as $65 billion over many years. Deminor declined to comment. The legal action is another headache for UBS, which is struggling to restructure after being hit hard by the credit crisis and is also at the center of an high-profile U.S. tax fraud case. UBS DENIES WRONGDOING UBS acted as the custodian of the Luxalpha fund and has repeatedly said that it did not recommend to clients any Madoff products and that clients knew what they were investing in. "The investors were sophisticated financial institutions. UBS is the custodian of Luxalpha. The fund documentation made it very clear that UBS (Luxembourg) SA was not expected to be responsible for the safekeeping of the assets," UBS said in a statement emailed to Reuters. "UBS does not have responsibility to these shareholders for the unfortunate results of the Madoff scandal." Luxembourg financial regulator CSSF, which is looking into the case, said the custodian bank had to ensure at all times that the money invested in the products was actually there and has given Switzerland's largest bank three months to make changes to UBS' custodian bank in the wake of Madoff's arrest. UBS has rejected the calls to reform its Luxembourg operations and said it would defend itself vigorously as it did not believe that the CSSF was correct. INDUSTRY SCARRED BY MADOFF Fund management industry players said investors' trust, which had already been hit hard by massive withdrawals in the market turmoil, dropped through the floor as the Madoff fraud was exposed. "I think this has really tarnished the industry's image. Promises were broken," said Ken Kinsey-Quick, head of multi-manager at hedge funds firm Thames River Capital. "It is going to take a long time for the reputation to be rebuilt." The issue was particularly painful in Luxembourg, Europe's largest funds center and home to the high-profile Luxalpha case. Neighbouring European Union member France irked Luxembourg by suggesting that Luxembourg, which has attracted funds for its absence of red tape and smooth funds approval process, was not applying in full strict EU rules for investor protection. "The dispute is not helping the Luxembourg funds industry. Many of the investors realize this is overblown on Luxembourg," Yves Francis, a partner with Deloitte in Luxembourg. "A lot will depend on the way Luxembourg answers and deals with the issue. The way forward is trying to reassure investors that the way we apply the law is severe."
