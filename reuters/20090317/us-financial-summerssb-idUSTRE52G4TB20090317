 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - A top White House economic adviser said on Tuesday the Obama administration will be "creative" in dealing with the issue of bonuses paid to American International Group employees but said the law must be respected. 

 Lawrence Summers, interviewed on CNBC television, also said the White House is seeking a method for dealing with failed institutions that has been missing in the current financial crisis. "We are going to be pushing very hard for a so-called resolution regime, a system that will enable the government to intervene when a big financial company gets in trouble in the future like the FDIC (Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.) does with banks and ....make the people who should bear the responsibility bear the responsibility," he said.
