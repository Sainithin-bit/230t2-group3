 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Tuesday she hoped lawmakers could move by next week on legislation to get back millions of dollars in bonuses from American International Group Inc. employees. 

 Several House committees have been working on legislation "that we could bring this week and next on how we could get the taxpayer's money back," Pelosi told reporters. "They've all been working on something, we want them to bring some of it to closure." Pelosi said that the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee was looking into one idea of taxing the bonuses while the Judiciary Committee was looking at alternatives to recoup the money "because there's some question as to whether a contract can be addressed in this way." The U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve has put up to $180 billion at AIG's disposal to avoid a complete meltdown of the global financial system and the company had obligations to pay out some $165 million in retention bonuses to employees.
