 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Canadian auto parts maker Magna MGa.TO wants Herbert Demel, the head of its Austrian car development and assembly plant, to become head of Opel, a German magazine said, citing sources. 

 Carl-Peter Forster, the current head GM Europe, had been touted to become the head of Opel's operating business with Demel assuming management of the Opel holding company, WirtschaftsWoche said on Sunday. The magazine said Forster wants to leave the company. Demel presently heads Magna-Steyr Fahrzeugtechnik in Graz, Austria. Top officials from Magna and Opel said last week they were confident General Motors GM.UL would go through with the sale of Opel to Magna despite being held up by last-minute EU competition concerns.
