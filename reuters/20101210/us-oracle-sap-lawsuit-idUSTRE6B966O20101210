 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Oracle Corp ORCL.O is seeking more than $211 million in interest from SAP AG ( SAPG.DE ) on top of the $1.3 billion jury verdict it won last month in a high stakes copyright infringement trial, a court document filed by Oracle on Friday showed. 

 The parties have already agreed that SAP will pay Oracle $120 million in attorneys fees, the filing said. Oracle wants an additional $211,662,935 payment for prejudgment interest due to the company. The two sides could not agree whether the final judgment in the case should provide for prejudgment interest, and if so, in what amount, the filing said.
