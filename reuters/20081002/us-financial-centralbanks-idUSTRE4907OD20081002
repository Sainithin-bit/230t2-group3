 LONDON  (Reuters) - Overnight money market stress eased in Europe on Thursday but lending rates remained above central bank targets, reflecting banks' firmly entrenched aversion to counterparty risk. 

 Rates have remained elevated despite massive liquidity injections by central banks around the world as the ongoing crisis in the financial system has prompted banks to hoard cash and refuse to lend to each other. The European Central Bank kept key rates unchanged as expected at 4.25 percent but some in the market expect the central bank to cut rates in the coming months to deal with economic weakness that could result from the banking crisis. Interbank overnight dollar rates fell for a second day running in London, after a record surge earlier this week as quarter end funding pressure eased and the U.S. Senate passed a revamped $700 billion bank bailout plan. Overnight dollar Libor rates fell more than a full point to 2.68125 percent from 3.79375 percent on Wednesday while euro overnight rates also eased. Rates further out jumped, with benchmark three-month rates -- which now cover the year-end period -- fixed higher in dollars and euros. Three-month dollar Libor rose to 5.31750 percent, their highest since January, up from 4.15000 percent on Wednesday. The euro-zone equivalent for euros hit its highest since the launch of the single currency, at 5.31750 percent. "The liquidity provisioning which central banks have made has effectively drawn a line under how bad things can get but not addressed underlying problems over the value of assets that are held by counterparties," said Richard McGuire, fixed income strategist at RBC Capital Markets in London. "Lending rates are still elevated looking further toward the end of this year. The counterparty risk measures ... are also historically elevated, part of which is due to the continued uncertainties about ... the efficacy of legislation even if it is passed this week." The U.S. Senate's passing of the $700 billion rescue plan is seen doing little to loosen liquidity in markets, as the bill still needs to be approved by the House of Representatives, which is expected later in the week. BALANCING ACT The closely watched TED spread, or the difference between market-based rates and the three-month U.S. government borrowing rates, was indicated in a 3.50 to 4.50 range from around 4.2350 percent early on Wednesday. The spread of three-month London interbank offered rates for dollar over OIS rates blew out to its widest at least since the credit crisis began more than a year ago, at 260.7 basis points from 245.25 basis points on Wednesday. The complete absence of confidence within the bank industry has kept money markets tight, especially so from last month when Lehman Brothers collapsed and surviving Wall Street investment banks had to completely restructure. As a result, central banks have put on a balancing act between pumping billions of dollars of liquidity into the financial system and then draining the excess funds. The ECB offered $50 billion in one-day dollars, after lending the same amount on Wednesday in an offer that attracted ample demand as banks continue to mop up central bank funds which they are unable to get on the interbank market. The ECB also planned to mop up excess overnight euro liquidity while the Bank of England offered $10 billion of overnight funds. Market participants are keen for details from central bank President Jean-Claude Trichet on which measures the central bank still has at its disposal to ease market tensions. In a further sign of banks' unwillingness to lend to each other, banks deposited 48.473 billion euros ($67.60 billion) overnight with the ECB as at October 1. "The central bank is increasingly becoming the only counterparty for banks that are either short of liquidity or have excess liquidity. This is reflected in the use of its marginal lending and deposit facility," said Elwin de Groot, economist at Rabobank.
