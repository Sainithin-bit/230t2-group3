 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Constellation Brands Inc ( STZ.N ), the world's largest wine producer, posted a quarterly profit excluding items that beat Wall Street estimates by a penny, and maintained its full-year earnings outlook. 

 On a net basis the owner of Robert Mondavi and Ravenswood wines reported a loss for its fiscal second quarter of $22.7 million, or 11 cents per share, compared with a net profit of $72.1 million, or 33 cents per share, a year before. Excluding restructuring charges, acquisition-related costs, inventory write-downs from selling some Australian assets and other items, Constellation earned a profit of 45 cents per share. Analysts on average were expecting 44 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. Net sales rose 7 percent to $956.5 million, with branded wine sales growing 6 percent and spirits sales growing 4 percent. Excluding the recent acquisitions of premium wine brands including Clos du Bois and Wild Horse, the company's branded wine business rose 4 percent. In North America, wine sales rose 7 percent from the year-ago period, when the company sold much less wine in order to reduce distributors' inventory levels. Wine sales, excluding acquisitions, fell 3 percent in Europe and 1 percent in Australia and New Zealand. The company said recent price increases hurt sales volume. Sales of the company's spirits brands, which include Svedka Vodka, Black Velvet Canadian Whisky and 99 Schnapps, rose 4 percent. The company maintained its prior earnings outlook for fiscal 2009, which ends in February, saying it expects to earn $1.68 to $1.76 per share, excluding items. Constellation Brands shares have increased 22 percent over the last six months, far outperforming the benchmark Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX , which has fallen 12 percent over the same period.
