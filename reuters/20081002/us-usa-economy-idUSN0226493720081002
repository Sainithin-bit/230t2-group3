 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. factory orders tumbled in August and the number of workers seeking jobless benefits rose in the latest week to a seven-year high as trauma in financial markets threatened to accelerate a deep downturn in the world's largest economy. 

 Thursday's reports were just the latest in a series of grim economic news, and follow Wednesday's data showing factory activity shrank in September to its lowest level since the 2001 recession, according to the Institute for Supply Management. "You add it all up, with the jobless claims and yesterday's ISM, and it's pretty damn clear we're in a recession," said Robert Macintosh, chief economist at Eaton Vance Corp in Boston. The data heightened anxiety in financial markets, sending stocks sharply lower as investors feared the economy was increasingly vulnerable to the multiple blows this year from high energy prices and severe constraints on credit. The number of people filing initial claims for jobless benefits was 497,000 in the week ended Saturday, the highest since the weeks following the September 11, 2001 attacks, the Labor Department said in a weekly report. Wall Street economists' had forecasts 475,000 initial claims. The Labor Department estimated that the effects of Hurricane Gustav in Louisiana and Hurricane Ike in Texas added approximately 45,000 claims to the total. Even without that, claims would have been well above the level of 400,000 that many economists associate with a recession. Weekly claims are one of the most up-to-date indicators, and the bad news is that even they probably do not fully reflect the effects of the heightened credit turmoil of recent weeks. "The economy is turning down pretty fast at this point unfortunately," said Nigel Gault, director of U.S. economic research at Global Insight. Comments from automobile industry executives made clear that the credit crisis was having a real effect on business. Ford Motor Co ( F.N ) Chief Executive Alan Mulally said he expected no recovery in the global car market until 2010 and urged governments and central banks to work together to bring stability back to the financial markets. The economy was clearly struggling even before the latest downward spiral in financial markets, though, as evidenced by the August factory orders data. New orders at U.S. factories tumbled by an unexpectedly steep 4 percent in August, the sharpest contraction since October 2006, a Commerce Department report showed. Analysts polled by Reuters were expecting factory orders to slip 2.5 percent. The news drove up government bonds, which benefit during times of economic weakness. Orders were brought down by a big drop in motor vehicle orders, the data showed. Still, even when volatile transportation orders were stripped out, factory orders shrank 3.3 percent, the steepest slide in orders excluding transportation since September 2001. There was little sign that financing conditions were improving for companies, which could deepen the economic rut. In fact, business lending and borrowing appears to have effectively shut down in some areas. Federal Reserve data showed the U.S. commercial paper market contracted dramatically for a third straight week. Commercial paper is a vital source of short-term funding for daily operations at many companies, and the weekly drop was the largest in at least seven years.
