 PARIS  (Reuters) - Porsche wants to retain the possibility of dominating Volkswagen later on even though it said this is currently not a realistic option. 

 "We do not want to rule out this possibility at the end of the day, some point in the future," Porsche Chief Executive Wendelin Wedeking told reporters on Thursday on the sidelines of Paris car show. Because, however, a domination and profit transfer agreement requires at least 75 percent control according to German law, Wedeking said this was for the moment only a theoretical possibility as the State of Lower Saxony controls 20 percent of VW votes. Wiedeking added that he expected crossing the 50-percent threshold this year would send a clear message as to who owns the biggest car company in Europe. "In people perception, it's clear then to everybody and there is no more discussion. I'm convinced this would bring piece into the company and build more trust with Porsche."
