 BASEL, Switzerland  (Reuters) - UBS AG made a small profit in the third quarter after a year of losses, it said on Thursday, lifting its shares as it signaled it had started to turn the corner even as the credit crisis engulfs many rivals. 

 UBS's reputation as an icon of Swiss banking stability was badly bruised after investments in toxic U.S. assets forced the world's largest wealth manager to make $42 billion of writedowns, more than any other bank in Europe, and to slash 7,000 jobs. UBS said on Thursday it had substantially reduced its U.S. commercial and residential mortgage-related assets, mainly via disposals, and promised the over 2,000 small and large investors gathered for an extraordinary shareholder meeting that a restructuring plan should help it regain global prominence. Chairman Peter Kurer said UBS had fared "reasonably well through this turmoil of the last weeks" as it had responded quickly to the crisis, recapitalizing the bank early with nearly $30 billion of fresh cash and overhauling its business model. "We want to be an accepted industry leader again. And in Switzerland, our home country, we want to be a respected national champion," Kurer said. "We will work hard and with humility on these ambitious objectives." Shareholders voted four new independent members onto UBS's board, in a further move to strengthen governance at the bank. Kurer launched a radical turnaround plan in August that involved separating UBS's troubled investment bank from its prized wealth management business after taking over from the highly-criticized former chief Marcel Ospel in April. But the bank's future was called into question again after the collapse of Lehman Brothers sparked a bout of U.S. and European state intervention to prop up the financial sector. In a statement ahead of the meeting, UBS said it expected to report a "small profit" for the third quarter when it announces results on November 4. It gave no figures on new writedowns, which analysts put at 3 billion Swiss francs ($2.7 billion), or on whether it has stemmed outflows from its wealth management arm. The bank was the first major lender to give indications about third-quarter results. "We regard this as marking a turning point for UBS, in terms of market perception, but also in terms of client perception," said Deutsche Bank analyst Matt Spick, who upgraded the stock to a "buy" although risks remain, including for investment banking. UBS's shares were up 10 percent at 21.70 Swiss francs at 9:04 a.m. EDT, among the top gainers in a 3.7 percent firmer DJ Stoxx European banking index, as the sector advanced on hopes a U.S. bailout plan for Wall Street will be salvaged. MARKETS "PRECARIOUS" INTO 2009 Kurer said 2009 would be "an overall profitable year" despite what he called "an extremely precarious situation" on the markets that he expected to last into next year. He said the bank would be able to pay a dividend again in 2010. The UBS stock price is still down two-thirds from a year ago. It tumbled to 15.18 francs on September 16 -- its lowest level since listing in its current form in 1998 -- after Lehman collapsed. That steep fall triggered speculation the bank may become a takeover target for larger rival HSBC or might even merge with local rival Credit Suisse, prompting the Swiss authorities to insist the bank was sound. Chief Executive Marcel Rohner said on Thursday the decision to offload some of the most risky assets would pay in the end. "Our belief was it was better to reduce our position. There still are considerable risks," Rohner said. Landsbanki analyst Dirk Becker said UBS probably only managed a profit in the third quarter due to the revaluation of its own debt, noting that the bank's credit default swap spread soared to 280 basis points in the quarter from 130 bps. "Considering the deep market dislocations, particularly in the weeks since the Lehman collapse, this should still be seen as a solid result," he said, adding that the news would lessen investor fears that UBS would need another capital injection. "But the fundamental situation has hardly changed. We expect there will be more money outflows from the private bank and more defections of client advisers," Becker said. Kurer said headcount and operating costs were in the process of being reduced, but made no specific mention of new job cuts. A source familiar with the situation told Reuters on Wednesday the bank is considering cutting another 1,900 posts in investment banking, equities and fixed income.
