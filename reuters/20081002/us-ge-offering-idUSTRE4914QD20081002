 BOSTON  (Reuters) - An offering of 547.83 million shares of General Electric Co ( GE.N ) priced at $22.25 per share, the U.S. conglomerate said on Thursday. 

 GE said on Wednesday it planned to raise $12 billion through a common stock offering to boost liquidity and give it more of a chance to make opportunistic acquisitions during a time of financial market turmoil. The Fairfield, Connecticut-based company is also selling $3 billion of preferred stock to Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc ( BRKa.N ). GE shares closed at $24.50 on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday, down 34 percent for the year, a steeper drop than the 21 percent slide of the Standard & Poor's 500 index  .SPX .
