 BOSTON  (Reuters) - General Electric Co ( GE.N ) shares fell as much as 10 percent on Thursday, touching a new 5-1/2-year low, as its sale of $15 billion in new stock to investors including Warren Buffett failed to soothe Wall Street worries. 

 GE shares have tumbled about 40 percent this year as the global credit crunch has taken a heavy toll on its hefty finance arm and the company warned that 2008 profit could drop 12 percent. The U.S. conglomerate sold $3 billion in preferred stock at $22.25 per share to Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc ( BRKa.N )( BRKb.N ) on Wednesday, and another 548 million common shares at the same price to other investors on Thursday. GE said the new capital will help improve its liquidity and provide the option to make acquisitions at a time of market turmoil. The U.S. Senate approved a $700 billion financial bailout package on Wednesday, and the U.S. House of Representatives is scheduled to vote on the plan on Friday. The rescue plan is intended to reinvigorate credit markets and frozen interbank lending, stabilize battered risky assets, including stocks, and ease corporate lending. Because of the breadth and depth of its operations, which stretch around the world and include jet engines to electricity-generating turbines to lending to the NBC television network, GE is regarded as an economic bellwether. "The fact that GE needs to go out and sell shares at $22.25 is not particularly good news," said Michael Church, financial analyst and portfolio manager at Church Capital Management, a Pennsylvania-based company that oversees $2 billion in investments and holds GE shares. "The deal they got with Buffett was not a particularly great deal for them. And this is a company that has been spending a heck of a lot of money buying back its stock, certainly much higher than $22.25." When GE Chief Executive Jeff Immelt warned investors last week about the looming 2008 profit drop, he said the Connecticut-based company would hold off buying more shares to lower leverage at GE Capital, which has businesses ranging from commercial lending to investing in real estate. COMMERCIAL PAPER WORRIES The cost to insure $10 million of GE debt for five years with credit-default swaps rose to $603,000 on Thursday, according to Markit Intraday data. That's up from $542,000 on Wednesday, but below a peak above $700,000 prior to the news of Buffett's investment. "I'm glad that they're doing these kind of things to preserve their credit rating, but it does bring into question this comment that they have no problems rolling commercial paper and this is pre-emptive," said Jason Small, assistant portfolio manager at Pennsylvania-based Chartwell Investment Partners, which manages about $5.5 billion in assets and holds GE shares. "I hope that's true, but it does make you wonder how much of this is pre-emptive and how much of this is reactive." GE spokesman Russell Wilkerson said Thursday the company's commercial funding operations have continued to run "very smoothly" with the company seeing "strong demand." GE is trying to scale back its exposure to the financial sector, with a goal of relying on GE Capital for just 40 percent of profits by the end of next year. That would be down from about half its profit last year. To lessen its exposure to volatile parts of the sector, it recently sold its Japanese consumer lending unit and plans to trim its $90 billion commercial real estate portfolio by $10 billion next year. To cope with the financial meltdown, many banks and investors are looking to preserve capital rather than make acquisitions. Last week, the company said it probably would not be able to sell its $30 billion U.S. private-label credit portfolio, which it has been shopping around since December. GE shares were down $2, or 8.2 percent, at $22.50 on the New York Stock Exchange after falling as low as $22.05, its lowest point since February 2003. The drop of 40 percent so far this year is almost double the decline of the Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI . The sharp slide in GE shares over the past month has cost the company its rank as the second most valuable publicly traded U.S. company. It now trails Exxon Mobil Corp ( XOM.N ), Microsoft Corp ( MSFT.O ) and Wal-Mart Stores Inc ( WMT.N ). (Additional reporting by  Dena Aubin  in New York, Editing by Maureen Bavdek/Jeffrey Benkoe)
