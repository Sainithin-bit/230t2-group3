 (Reuters) - Shockwaves from the global credit crisis spread on Thursday, threatening industry and jobs worldwide and putting pressure on Congress to pass a $700 billion bailout of the U.S. financial sector. 

 But how much is $700 billion -- what can it buy? Compared to the debt of the United States, which the U.S. Treasury has asked to increase to $11.315 trillion to fund the plan, it doesn't seem much. Here are a few of the things that can be done with $700 billion: -- The United States has spent more than $800 billion on wars in Iraq and Afghanistan since 2001. -- Just 12 Bill Gateses could foot the bail-out bill. The Microsoft founder tops Forbes' U.S. rich list with a personal fortune estimated at $57 billion. -- Collectively, the 400 richest Americans have a net worth of $1.57 trillion, or roughly twice the value of the bail-out. -- $700 billion is roughly equal to the GDP of Netherlands, or five times that of Pakistan. -- It is only $100 billion short of the combined GDP of all of Africa. -- It is only $78 billion more than the 2007 U.S. defense budget. -- It would buy around 130 of the latest, biggest aircraft carriers, which cost about $5.3 billion each. -- The plan could be funded with the market capitalizations of the world's two largest oil companies, Exxon Mobil Corp and PetroChina, which stood at $403 billion and $325 billion respectively at Thursday's close of trading. There would even be $28 billion in change. Sources Reuters/Economist/Military Balance (Writing by  David Cutler , London Editorial Reference Unit, and Jijo Jacob)
