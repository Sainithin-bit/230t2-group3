 PARIS  (Reuters) - Renault is targeting "reasonable" sales of the new version of its best-selling Megane family of cars, but would not disclose a sales forecast, Bruno Ancelin, senior vice president of C-Segment programs, said on Thursday. 

 Ancelin would also not be drawn on a target for market for the new version of the best-selling Megane, more than 8 million of which have sold in the versions since their 1995 launch. But he noted that Volkswagen's Golf -- "a redoubtable competitor" -- occupies around 18 percent of the C-Segment, or compact car market in Europe. The Ford Focus and Peugeot's 308 each have between 8 and 9 percent. This level "would seem to be a good benchmark," Ancelin said. "We're targeting reasonable volumes." Ancelin sees 95 percent of sales of the new family of Meganes coming from western Europe with some sales in eastern European markets making up the rest, Ancelin said in an interview at the Paris Motor Show, where the coupe and sedan version of the new Megane were unveiled, that the car will be marketed in 20 countries before mid-December, after it goes on sale in mid-November.
