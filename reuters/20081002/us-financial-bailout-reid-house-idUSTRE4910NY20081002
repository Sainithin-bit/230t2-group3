 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said he expected the House of Representatives to approve the financial rescue package approved by the Senate on Wednesday. 

 "It is my expectation that the House of Representatives will follow suit," the Nevada Democrat said after the Senate approved the Wall Street bailout legislation by a vote of 74 to 25. On Monday, the House rejected an earlier version of the rescue package in a stunning vote that triggered large losses in stock markets around the world. The House is expected to take up the revised bailout package on Friday. (Reporting by Joanne Allen; Editing by  Tim Dobbyn )
