 PARIS  (Reuters) - Alfa Romeo is looking at a number of ideas for a vehicle which the Italian sports car maker could sell in more than one region to help it expand beyond Europe, its chief executive said on Thursday. 

 "We need a global concept," Luca De Meo told Reuters at the Paris autoshow. "I think possibly a medium SUV crossover." Many car makers are coming out with what are called "global cars" that they can sell in many regions of the world without having to restyle them to the preferences of every region. By selling a single model, they save money on parts and production. "There are various segments that we are considering but from a global perspective rather than a European one," he said. For example, the three-door compact MiTo, the latest model to be rolled out by Alfa Romeo, is more suited to European tastes, De Meo said. So it would not necessarily work in a market like Russia, a booming market where drivers prefer big cars and sports utility vehicles (SUVs), he said. For Russia, where De Meo Alfa is looking for a bigger presence, Romeo would need something bigger than the MiTo, he said. So far, Alfa Romeo has only one distributor in the country. Russia is growing so fast that it is expected to surpass Germany as Europe's biggest car market. Alfa Romeo is part of the Fiat group ( FIA.MI ). De Meo declined to say how the financial crisis would affect sales for the year and beyond, but he ventured to say that the MiTo could be well positioned to attract sports car lovers looking for something smaller and cheaper. Like its rival, the Mini by BMW ( BMWG.DE ), the MiTo did not make them feel like they were losing out on performance and other features usually associated with a bigger car, he said. The Mito had received some 10,000 orders since its launch a few weeks ago, he said. The car marks Alfa Romeo's effort to improve its reputation on quality and service and recover market share lost to BMW and Audi ( VOWG.DE ) in the premium car segment. De Meo declined to comment on the talks Alfa Romeo was having with BMW to get the German premium car maker to help it enter the United States, apart from saying it expected to reach an agreement by the end of the year. He also declined to comment on the timing of Alfa Romeo's entry in the U.S. market. Fiat has previously said it was aiming for 2010 or 2011. In the meantime, Alfa Romeo was working on a successor to the 147 and a new 169, De Meo said. (Reporting by Gilles Castonguay; Editing by Jon Loades-Carter)
