 BLOOMINGTON, Indiana  (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve must not ignore inflation, despite severe turmoil that has gripped financial markets and could inflict a protracted downturn on the U.S. economy, one of its top policy-makers said on Thursday. 

 "Until inflation clearly moderates, my colleagues and I will need to be especially watchful that our accommodative policy stance does not begin to worsen the outlook for long-run price stability," said James Bullard, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis. Bullard is not a voting member of the Fed's interest-rate setting committee this year. He said the Fed should turn its attention to fighting inflation once market strains had eased, and stressed that the outlook for both inflation and growth was unclear. "There is some possibility of a relatively benign outcome, where the financial market shakeout plays itself out and real economic performance is muted but not disastrous. "But there is also some possibility of a very adverse outcome in which the entire economy is drawn into a protracted downturn," he told an audience at Indiana University-Bloomington. The crisis has fundamentally reshaped the U.S. financial landscape and driven Congress to consider a $700 billion bank bailout to head off feared drastic economic consequences. In addition, weak economic data has caused investors to bet on another interest rate cut at the Fed's next scheduled policy meeting, at the end of this month. The Fed has held its benchmark lending rate at 2 percent since April, after cutting rates by a total of 3.25 percentage points beginning in September 2007. Futures markets now show more than a 90 percent chance that the Fed will lower rates to 1.5 percent this month. Bullard urged that amid all the dramatic developments, the U.S. central bank not forget the lasting consequences of allowing inflation to get out of hand. "Inflation and inflation instability put an economy's financial sector at risk, " he said. "Therefore, it is critical that monetary policy-makers not lose sight of the importance of maintaining price stability -- even during periods of financial turbulence."
