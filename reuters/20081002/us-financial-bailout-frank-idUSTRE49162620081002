 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - A key U.S. lawmaker was cautiously optimistic on Thursday that there is support in the House of Representatives to pass a $700 billion financial rescue bill and added that the Treasury could begin buying tainted mortgage assets soon. 

 "I think so, I can't be sure," House Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank said on CNBC television. Financial market gyrations since the House failed to pass a version of the measure on Monday may sway some lawmakers who had opposed the bailout to support an amended version, the Massachusetts Democrat said.
