 PARIS  (Reuters) - General Motors Corp. (GM) ( GM.N ) Chief Operating Officer Fritz Henderson said on Thursday he expected U.S. and western European markets to stay weak in the first half of 2009. 

 "Certainly in the first half it's going to be weak," Henderson told reporters at a roundtable discussion at the Paris auto show. Henderson said he expected to provide details of the Hummer brand to potential buyers this month. He said several parties had expressed interest in Hummer and GM expected to know by the end of the year whether there would be a deal or not. "It's been my experience that once people have the information, things move a lot faster. Generally you'll understand whether or not there can be a deal by the end of the year," he said.
