 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - SAP AG must pay Oracle Corp prejudgment interest on a recent $1.3 billion copyright infringement verdict, but not at the formula suggested by Oracle, according to a judge's ruling filed on Tuesday. 

 Oracle had sought more than $211 million in interest after winning a high stakes trial in an Oakland federal courtroom last month. But U.S. District Judge Phyllis Hamilton opted for a methodology suggested by SAP to calculate the interest. Hamilton did not specify in her order how much SAP will ultimately pay.
