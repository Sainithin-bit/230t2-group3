 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The average price of U.S. gasoline rose above $3 a gallon over the past week, reaching its highest level since October 2008, the Energy Department said on Monday. 

 The national price for regular gasoline increased 7 cents from the previous week to an average of $3.05 per gallon, as rising crude oil prices bolstered fuel costs. Crude oil settled down 51 cents at $91 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange on Monday as a major blizzard in the U.S. Northeast cut down on already thin holiday trading volume. Diesel fuel prices increased 4.6 cents to $3.29 a gallon, the department said in its weekly survey of service stations. (Reporting by  Ayesha Rascoe ; editing by  Jim Marshall )
