The company said profit rose to $26.1 million, or 49 cents a share, in the first quarter ended May 1 from $24.3 million, or 45 cents a share, a year earlier. Analysts on average forecast 43 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Earlier this month, BJ's said sales rose 12.9 percent to $2.55 billion, helped by a 7.8 percent increase in sales at stores open at least a year. (Reporting by  Brad Dorfman ; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn)
