 TOKYO  (Reuters) - The Bank of Japan said on Friday it will offer one-year loans at 0.1 percent to encourage commercial banks to lend more to industries with growth potential. 

 Below are details of the new framework decided at a two-day policy meeting: -- The BOJ will offer fixed-rate loans with a maturity of one year, in principle, to private banks at the overnight call rate of 0.1 percent. -- Banks can roll over the loans so they can be used to fund long-term investment. That means they can borrow from the BOJ for several years if necessary to fund long-term investment. -- The loans will be made against pooled collateral with the same standards applied as in the BOJ's regular money market operations. -- The funds will be available to private banks that submit their plans to support industries with growth potential. The BOJ will assess the plans and determine how much it will loan to banks, and for how long. -- When it starts the program the BOJ will fix the amount of funds that will be available, the period for accepting applications and how many times banks can roll over the loans, based on applicants' loan and investment records. -- It hopes to start lending under the new program from around the summer. -- The BOJ did not define which industries would be regarded as having "growth potential". -- But Governor Masaaki Shirakawa said the central bank will take into account the government's definition of industries with growth potential when setting details of the program. Among the industries cited by the government are environment, health care, and tourism, as well as research and development. -- The BOJ wants to design the new loan program so it is applicable to a wide range of industries. It plans to keep the criteria broad enough to give commercial banks flexibility in deciding which industries to lend to. -- The BOJ did not announce a target or an estimate of the amount of lending that will be made under the program. The scheme will not be a permanent one and a deadline will be set possibly by the time of its next policy meeting in June. -- The BOJ says the new loan scheme is not aimed at influencing the yield curve but at redirecting money to growth industries. This means the amount on offer under the program should not be huge. -- Shirakawa instructed BOJ staff last month to consider a scheme to redirect money to industries with areas of potential new demand. He said the framework would be part of an effort to boost Japan's potential economic growth, which is now around 0.5 percent, and pull it out of deflation.
