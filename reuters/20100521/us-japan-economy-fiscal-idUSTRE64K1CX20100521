 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japan will map out long-term plans in June to rein in its debt as the Greek crisis sets alarm bells ringing worldwide that investors might target fiscally weak countries. 

 The government needs a credible plan to curtail its public debt -- the biggest among developed countries -- to keep investors happy and stave off the risk of a ratings downgrade. Following are questions and answers on Japan's fiscal reform: WHAT'S IN THE PIPELINE? The government is planning to come up with two plans in June. One will be a medium-term fiscal plan that will include binding caps on spending for the state budget over the next three years. The second plan will set longer-term targets to fix Japan's finances and will include a timetable for bringing the government's primary balance into surplus and cutting the country's large public debt-to-GDP ratio. The Cabinet Office estimated this fiscal year's primary balance, the degree to which the government can cover its spending without issuing bonds, would be 33.5 trillion yen ($371 billion). Public debt to GDP is climbing toward 200 percent. Finance Minister Naoto Kan and National Strategy Minister Yoshito Sengoku, who is in charge of crafting long-term fiscal plans, have acknowledged the need for a credible plan. WHAT'S AT STAKE? Financial markets are already on edge over government indebtedness following the huge stimulus spending during the global downturn. Japan could be punished by investors and credit rating agencies unless it comes up with a credible plan. With that in mind, Kan attempted to submit to parliament a bill setting a legally binding target for reducing the budget deficits in coming years. But the plan has been shelved amid opposition from the ruling Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) and its junior coalition, which have their eyes on upper house elections due in July and don't want to scare off voters. They fear introducing a fiscal reform bill ahead of the election could be a tactical mistake because it could force them to confront the issue of raising the national consumption tax, long seen as the answer to cutting the fiscal deficit, but potentially a vote killer. WHERE DO THE DISAGREEMENTS LIE? While the government crafts a fiscal reform plan, the party is drafting a campaign manifesto for the upper house elections. The final platform is expected to come out by the end of this month, but disagreement is strongest on whether to include in the manifesto a pledge to raise Japan's consumption or sales tax after the next general election, due to be held by 2013. While analysts say a sales tax hike is inevitable to rein in Japan's fiscal debt, Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama has said he would not raise the tax until the next general election. Fiscal hawks like Kan and Sengoku want the party to commit to a sales tax hike after the general election. But the party's kingpin, Ichiro Ozawa is not keen, leaving the issue unsettled for now. The final decision rests with Hatoyama. But with his leadership skills in doubt, financial analysts doubt he can make a tough decision and pull his party and the government together on this debate. HOW URGENT IS THE NEED FOR A CREDIBLE PLAN? Ratings agencies are already worried about the government's borrowing so the need is pressing. Unless the Democrats cut back on spending, new debt issuance could exceed 51 trillion yen ($551 billion) in the next fiscal year ending in March 2012, a finance ministry estimate shows. That would come close to the hefty 53 trillion yen in debt issued in the year to March, when tax revenues plunged and public spending surged amid the global financial crisis. Kan wants to cap new debt issuance next fiscal year at the same level as 44.3 trillion yen earmarked for the current fiscal year. That may be a tall order though given strong opposition from ruling party lawmakers against spending cuts. This is particularly true with voter support for Hatoyama sliding ahead of the upper house election. WHAT DO MARKETS THINK? Markets have so far bought the government's argument that Japan is not like Greece, because its huge public debt is well funded by the country's massive domestic savings. The European debt crisis has even boosted demand for Japanese government bonds among risk-shy investors, keeping the benchmark 10-year bond yield near a four-month low. Analysts say having a numerical target for cutting the public debt and returning the primary balance to surplus in the fiscal reform plans won't be enough to push bond yields further down. The government needs to set a date for when it will increase the sales tax rate, or it will need to support Kan's idea of having a legal framework for fiscal discipline to ease market doubts that the government has the fiscal situation under control. "What markets care about the most is whether fiscal targets look feasible or not, because past governments failed to achieve their fiscal goals," said Tomohiko Katsu, deputy general manager of capital markets at Shinsei Bank in Tokyo.
