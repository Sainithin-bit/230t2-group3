 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Opel will finance the development of new products using wage concessions from its European workforce worth 265 million euros ($329 million) annually, a source familiar with the matter said on Friday. 

 According to a deal worked out between labor leaders and management due to be signed next week, the savings would be administered by a trustee who would guarantee the proper use of the funds. (Reporting by Angelika Gruber)
