 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - President Barack Obama will meet on financial reform on Friday with Senator Christopher Dodd, the chairman of the Senate banking committee, and Representative Barney Frank, chairman of the House financial services committee, the White House said. 

 The meeting is set for 11:30 a.m. EDT. The Senate approved a sweeping Wall Street reform bill on Thursday, capping months of wrangling over the biggest overhaul of financial regulation since the 1930s in a victory for Obama on one of his top policy priorities. The Senate bill must now be reconciled with a measure approved in December by the House of Representatives before a final package can go to Obama to be signed into law.
