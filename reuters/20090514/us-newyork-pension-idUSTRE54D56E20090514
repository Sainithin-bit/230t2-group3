 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Private equity fund The Carlyle Group will pay $20 million to settle its role in a probe of investment firms that hired politically-connected people to help them get chosen to manage New York state's pension fund, the state attorney general said on Thursday. 

 Carlyle also agreed to a new code of conduct that bars it from using middlemen to win business from pensions and blocks campaign contributions to pension officers for two years, Attorney General Andrew Cuomo told reporters on a call. Cuomo's probe, which has led to two guilty pleas and been joined by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and 36 states, centered on the role of Henry Morris, a former New York state comptroller's top fund-raiser, who was indicted along with the pension fund's chief investment officer. "It's the intersection of corporate and government corruption," Cuomo, the state's current attorney general, said adding the code will protect retirees from having pension investments directed by politicians rewarding cronies. About 41 percent of the $85 billion Carlyle invests is for global public pensions, but Cuomo said it had only "limited success" in landing New York's fund until it hired Morris. After Carlyle retained Morris on the advice of an energy fund partner, Riverstone Holdings LLC, New York's pension fund committed to invest $730 million with Carlyle. Carlyle then paid nearly $13 million to the Connecticut-based broker dealer Searle that worked with Morris, and Searle paid "the lion's share" of the fees to a shell company that Morris controlled, Cuomo said. Carlyle said it "was victimized by Hank Morris's alleged web of deceit," and intends to sue Searle and Morris for over $15 million to recover the fees it paid and other damages. A Searle lawyer had no immediate comment; Morris's lawyer, who has said he is innocent, was not immediately available to comment. Carlyle hired Morris after its energy fund partner hired him through an intermediary -- former hedge fund manager Barrett Wissman, who in mid-April became the first person to plead guilty in the pension kickback scheme. Carlyle told New York state's pension fund that it had hired Searle, but "Carlyle was unaware that Searle paid a percentage of these placement fees to Wissman," Cuomo said. "Carlyle is taking responsibility for their partner's actions," Cuomo said. Carlyle's new code of conduct applies to all its U.S. businesses and Cuomo wants all investment firms to follow the same curbs when dealing with U.S. public pensions. The code also blocks Carlyle from managing pensions for two years if the firm, its principals, employees and family members make political contributions to elected or appointed officials who have sway over investment decisions, Cuomo said. "We are trying to create a race to the top," Cuomo said. Carlyle partners made generous contributions to the former state comptroller's campaigns, Cuomo said. The new code limits donations to $300, increases disclosures and aims to limit a "revolving door" of hiring between firms and public pensions. Start-up funds that lack the in-house marketing muscle of bigger competitors will not suffer from the ban on placement agents, he said, because they can still hire advisers, and in any case, the agents preferred to market well-known funds.
