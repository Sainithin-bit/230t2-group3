 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury Department said on Thursday that Chrysler's decision to shut down 789 of its 3,181 dealers was a "necessary" step to help the troubled carmaker rebound to health. 

 "A stronger Chrysler, supported by an efficient and effective dealer network, will provide more stability for current employees and the prospect for future employment growth," the Treasury said in a statement. The Obama administration's auto task force "played no role" in deciding which or how many dealers would close in the consolidation plan, it added. (Reporting by  Corbett B.
