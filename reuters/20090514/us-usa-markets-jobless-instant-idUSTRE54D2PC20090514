 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The number of U.S. workers filing new claims for jobless benefits rose more than expected last week, government data showed on Thursday, pushed up by auto plant shutdowns related to Chrysler's bankruptcy. 

 U.S. producer prices rose faster than expected in April, government data showed on Thursday, driven by a surge in food costs. KEY POINTS: JOBLESS CLAIMS * Initial claims for state unemployment insurance benefits increased 32,000 to a seasonally adjusted 637,000 in the week ended May 9, reversing an easing trend of the previous two weeks. * A Labor Department official said "a good part of the increase is due to automotive states and claims." * Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast new claims rising to 610,000. PRODUCER PRICES * The Labor Department said the Producer Price Index climbed 0.3 percent after declining 1.2 percent in March. Food prices rose 1.5 percent in April, the biggest increase since January 2008. * Food costs rose on a record jump in egg prices, along with soaring prices for vegetables and meat. * Excluding food, the headline PPI would have increased 0.1 percent. * Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast a 0.1 percent rise in the overall index. COMMENTS: NIGEL GAULT, CHIEF U.S. ECONOMIST, IHS GLOBAL INSIGHT, LEXINGTON, MASSACHUSETTS: "The Labor Department said there was a good part of automotive claims, without being precise and the obvious culprit would be the Chrysler bankruptcy. They essentially shut down, just like that. The autoworkers do tend to file pretty quickly. That's probably what's come into this week's number, and at least on initial claims. "I think that there are signals that the claims have maybe topped out, but I don't think there is any signal that they're going to drop rapidly. These claims are likely to stay high for a long time, which means we're going to be losing jobs for a long time. "The continuing claims today were not good. The total people claiming went up by 202,000, that's a big increase for one week. Of course these numbers are volatile, but that's not a good signal for where the unemployment rate is going to continue to rise very rapidly." DAVID RESLER, CHIEF ECONOMIST, NOMURA SECURITIES, NEW YORK: "We're still facing a very tough job market... "When we get out of the recession and the economy is no longer declining, it's not going to feel like a great economy. When you get 637,000 people filing for claims in the latest week, it's a pretty good indication we haven't stop declining yet. When we do stop declining, we'll see claims in the 500s, maybe in the 400s, but we're not quite there yet. "It is the week in which Chrysler filed (for bankruptcy) and laid off everybody in their factories. It could be that that explains part of the increase... "I think it is just underscoring how difficult it's going to be to get the economy growing again." TIM GHRISKEY, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, SOLARIS ASSET MANAGEMENT, BEDFORD HILLS, NEW YORK: PPI: "PPI came in basically on expectations, at least the core rate. The top line number was just slightly above so that was a pretty mundane report." JOBLESS: "I think what's suddenly impacted the equity futures here was the initial jobless claims, which were worse than expected, so higher claims. The whisper out there was that we would likely to see a number below, or better-than expectations, so a lower number. We'd been hearing that for several days and other economic data seemed to point to that. That was clearly a disappointment here. But it's early in the going and we'll see what happens with the futures between now and the market open." LEE OLVER, FIXED INCOME STRATEGIST, SMH CAPITAL, HOUSTON: JOBLESS CLAIMS: "I'm most concerned about the continued claims jumping. It gives me concerns about a stabilizing labor market. I'm afraid a little Round-Up has been sprayed on the green shoots. Treasuries improved a little bit, but the market as whole sees this falling within the expected range." PPI: "PPI has been probably hit by a rise in commodity prices but that followed by a big drop the previous month. What I see at the moment is that headline producer prices are dropping rapidly. Core PPI are up 3.4 percent year-over-year but it's not feeding through so I'm not worried about inflation." ANNA PIRETTI, ECONOMIST, BNP PARIBAS, NEW YORK: "They still point to a deteriorating labor market. Initial claims had been declining and now they took back some of that. Continuing claims, which are much more stable, it signifies that people who have lost their jobs are not getting back into the labor market. The pool of the unemployed continues to become larger and larger, pointing to increases on the unemployment rate. That has negative implications for consumption." SHAUN OSBORNE, SENIOR CURRENCY STRATEGIST, TD SECURITIES, TORONTO: "The claims were a bit weaker than expected, though it appear a big part of that is related to the auto sector. So we might not see too much follow-through to the dollar's move against the yen. The dollar is already rising against some other currencies. "The S&P has broken some trend lines with three down days this week. It looks like we've broken the rising trend that had been in place the last few weeks. I certainly think the market is a bit more risk sensitive, but whether the dollar rallies significantly on this is uncertain. The negative correlation between the dollar and stocks is looking a bit mature." DAN GREENHAUS, ANALYST, MILLER TABAK & CO, NEW YORK: JOBLESS CLAIMS: "The number is higher than expected, but I would say that that is due to the auto plant shutdown. That's what made it higher than consensus, and I don't think anyone will be surprised that that led to an uptick." PPI: "The number was pretty much in line, no real surprises. The question going forward, however will be to what degree does increases in energy prices flow through to consumer and producer prices."
