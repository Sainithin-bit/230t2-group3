 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc ( WMT.N ) is offering aisles filled with merchandise priced at $1 and taking other steps to boost sales in its second quarter, an executive said in an interview on Thursday. 

 Earlier in the day, the world's largest retailer reported a flat first-quarter profit. In its current second quarter, it now faces tough comparisons with a year ago, when its results were boosted by customers spending tax rebate cash in its stores. Treasurer Charles Holley said Wal-Mart has planned a number of merchandising initiatives to appeal to cash-strapped shoppers, including its dollar program. "If you go down the aisles, you'll see an aisle where everything is $1, and we'll be doing more things like that throughout the next couple of months," he said. Smaller discount chain Target Corp ( TGT.N ) already has $1 sections near the front of its stores stocked with accessories and seasonal items. Holley said customers continue to be worried about the economy and unemployment, although they have a little bit more money to spend on discretionary items, like home goods, because gasoline prices remain below year-ago levels. He said it is still tough to forecast whether the economy has hit a bottom. "I think it's too early to know where the economy is going at the moment," he said.
