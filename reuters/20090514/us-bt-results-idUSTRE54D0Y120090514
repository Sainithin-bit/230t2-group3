 LONDON  (Reuters) - British telecoms carrier BT cut its dividend and announced 15,000 further job losses on Thursday after its pension costs almost doubled and a 1.58 billion pound ($2.4 billion) writedown tipped it into an annual loss. 

 The writedown is to be taken at its Global Services unit, a supplier of IT services to multinational companies which the company had for years touted as its growth engine. The move follows a thorough review of the division and some of its more over-optimistic contracts after two profit warnings. The scale of the contributions needed to get Britain's largest pension scheme back into the black also added to the gloom. But analysts said the statement should act as a "clearing of the decks" and provide a floor to the share price. They also welcomed the cost cutting by the former state monopoly and cash flow targets, but noted that the full-year revenue forecast of a fall by 4 to 5 percent was worst than expected. BT's shares were down 2.2 percent at 92.3 pence at 1034 GMT (6:34 a.m. EDT) after falling almost 60 percent in a year. SECOND TURNAROUND BT, which is seen by investors as a yield stock, last posted an annual loss in 2001 when it was forced to launch a record British rights issue and sell its mobile unit to reduce debt. This time around its writedown in the fourth quarter meant it posted a full year loss of 134 million pounds. "We expected a massive and complex set of results and we have not been disappointed," said Daiwa analyst Michael Kovacocy. "The turnaround story continues, and we believe that today's results have set a bottom in the share price and will allow for material upside moving forward." BT said profit before tax on an adjusted basis was down 40 percent and on a reported basis showed a 1.28 billion pound loss. PENSION GAP Britain's biggest fixed-line telecoms provider also said it would have to almost double its pension contributions to 525 million pounds ($794.1 million) a year for three years. It has been engaged in a triennial review of its pension and declined to give the review's verdict on the deficit, saying it should provide the figure in the coming months. It did however give its pension position at March 31 on an IAS 19 accounting basis, as a deficit of 4 billion pounds gross, compared with a surplus of 2.8 billion pounds last year. The market value of the BT pension scheme assets was 29.3 billion pounds, compared to 37.3 billion a year ago. It had pension scheme liabilities of 33.1 billion pounds. A leading pensions expert said on Wednesday that BT's pension deficit now stood at 11 billion pounds, although most city analysts expected it to be between 6 to 8 billion pounds. Analysts at Investec said the failure to provide the review's pension deficit -- seen as a truer reflection than IAS -- could continue to weigh on the shares. To help meet its increased pension obligations, BT cut its final dividend to 1.1 pence to give a full year dividend of 6.5 pence, which was down 59 percent on last year. It also announced plans to deliver a net reduction in capital expenditure and operating costs of well over 1 billion pounds in the year 2009 to 2010, with group capital expenditure being reduced to around 2.7 billion pounds. As part of the cuts, its total labor workforce, of both permanent and contract staff, fell by 15,000 to 147,000 in the year to March and said it expected a similar number next year. "We have long thought that cost-cutting and a reduction in headcount was necessary to truly unlock greater efficiency and value for BT," Kovacocy said. The job cuts were all voluntary and through not replacing staff and BT said they expected this to be the case this year too. Chief Executive Ian Livingston, who took over less than a year ago, had pledged to turn around the Global Services unit after controlling costs at the retail unit and analysts said the market had already factored in many of the charges. Some analysts had feared the company could slash its final dividend completely but welcomed the fact it had now been addressed. Livingston said it also had room to grow as the company adapted to the new pension payments. (Reporting by Kate Holton; Editing by  Paul Hoskins  and  Andrew Callus )
