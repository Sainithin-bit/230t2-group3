 BERLIN  (Reuters) - German Economy Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg said on Thursday there was interest in General Motors' ( GM.N ) Opel unit from investors other than Fiat and Magna, but that the interest of one financial investor had waned. 

 "We have these two. As to a third one who has made himself known, here the euphoria seems to decline," he told Reuters at the start of a high-level government meeting to discuss future financing for Opel. He also said the German government did not know what the financing needs of carmaker Opel would be. (Reporting by Sabine Siebold)
