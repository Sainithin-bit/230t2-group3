 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - President Barack Obama on Wednesday welcomed the House of Representatives' approval of a landmark financial reform bill, saying it was a victory in the fight against irresponsibility on Wall Street. 

 "It will make our financial system more transparent, so that complex transactions that escaped scrutiny in the past will now be done in the light of day," he said in a statement.
