 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The number of workers filing new applications for unemployment insurance rose unexpectedly last week, a report showed on Thursday, heightening fears the labor market recovery was stalling. 

 KEY POINTS: * Initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 13,000 to a seasonally adjusted 472,000 in the week ended June 26, the Labor Department said. * Analysts polled by Reuters had expected claims to slip to 452,000 from the previously reported 457,000, which was revised slightly up to 459,000 in Thursday's report. * A Labor Department official said only one state was estimated. * The four-week moving average of new claims, considered a better measure of underlying labor market trends, rose 3,250 to 466,500 -- the highest level since early March. COMMENTS: KEVIN FLANAGAN, CHIEF FIXED INCOME STRATEGIST, MORGAN STANLEY SMITH BARNEY, PURCHASE, NEW YORK: "What we are seeing here is a sideways move in the labor markets. I don't think we are seeing renewed deterioration. We are getting regular reminders that we are not ready for any significant job creation." CRAIG THOMAS, SENIOR ECONOMIST, PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES, PITTSBURGH: JOBLESS CLAIMS: "It's certainly a disappointment after the ADP number, which was also a disappointment. The market is not going to like this. This tells me that the economy is not creating enough jobs to bring down the unemployment rate. We have a lot uncertainties. You name it -- the Gulf Coast oil spill, the European debt crisis and domestic policies here." CHALLENGER LAYOFFS: "It's more of the same. The economy is not going to contract. It just feels like it's plodding along." SUVRAT PRAKASH, U.S. INTEREST RATE STRATEGIST, BNP PARIBAS, NEW YORK: "During the payrolls week this number gets dwarfed by ADP and nonfarm payrolls but technically it is a more up-to-date measure. "But I don't expect this extra bid to the bond market to last long unless it's based on other things. We rallied a few bips on it. It's certainly weaker than expected but for the most part Treasuries are just going to be watching the stock market and trading on pretty light volume. "Treasuries were already richer on the day. In the last couple of hours there has been some pretty healthy buying. I think some people are covering shorts just wanting to position for payrolls. No one's really got their hopes up high now for this number tomorrow." TOM PORCELLI, U.S. ECONOMIST, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS, NEW YORK: "Utterly weak. They remain stubbornly high. While this number doesn't necessarily have any bearing on tomorrow's payrolls report, what we should keep in mind is the handoff to July is not looking good. "Going forward, we should look for very modest gains in payrolls at best. "The bulk of data over recent weeks have just been very negative. This would be largely supportive of the bond market."
