 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Weak economic data from the United States and China spurred investors to sell off equities, oil and the U.S. dollar on Thursday over growing concerns the global economy is entering a new downturn. 

 The euro rose over 2 percent against the dollar while the greenback hit a seven-month low against the yen. Crude oil slumped more than 3 percent in the biggest one-day slide in nearly four weeks. Gold prices plunged nearly 4 percent as the sell-off in equities and a technical break triggered heavy fund selling. "What you are seeing is clearly a nervous feeling about all assets, whether they be tangible or intangible, paper or not. The overall mood is bearish and metals may not be the safe haven that you can just bank on," said Scott Meyers, senior analyst at New York-based Pioneer Futures. New claims for U.S. jobless benefits rose unexpectedly in the last week, a day ahead of the government's key June employment report, which is expected to show the first decline this year, according to a Reuters poll. U.S. Treasuries gained, but the benchmark 10-year notes were flat after an early rally that drove yields to 14 month lows. European government bonds closed on a positive note. The Standard & Poor's 500 stock index  .SPX  closed at a nine-month low of 1,027.37, off 3.34 points or 0.32 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  fell 41.49 points, or 0.42 percent, to 9,732.53. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  lost 7.88 points, or 0.37 percent, at 2,101.36. "Right now everyone is so concerned about a major 'potential depression' or deflation taking place -- it's really roiling the market," said Paul Mendelsohn, chief investment strategist at Windham Financial Services in Charlotte, Vermont. "The focus is shifting back to us and, depending on what happens tomorrow, will have a tremendous impact on whether that focus stays on us or goes back to Europe," added Mendelsohn. Growth in U.S. manufacturing activity in June slowed to its lowest level since December 2009, while an official survey showed the pace of Chinese manufacturing activity last month was the weakest since February. U.S. industry data showed contracts for pending sales of previously owned homes plunged a record 30 percent in May. Gold mining company stocks were among the hardest hit on Wall Street on Thursday after being one the few strong sectors in the second quarter as the price of gold fell. The PHLX Gold/Silver Sector index fell 4.4 percent. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300  .FTEU3  index of top shares closed down 2.4 percent to 969.21 points, a five-week closing low. The market extended losses after the weak U.S. economic data, Financials were among the worst performers, with the STOXX Europe 600 banking index falling 2.6 percent. On a positive note, the European Central Bank's offering of six-day loans saw banks borrow 111.2 billion euros ($136.1 billion). Investors have worried that European banks are too reliant on ECB funds, especially with the expiration of 442 billion euros of one-year loans on Thursday. Japan's Nikkei-225 stock index  .N225  fell 2 percent to its lowest close since November, breaking key support levels. EURO REBOUNDS The euro surged 2.37 percent to $1.2524 after the economic data. It was the euro's best daily performance against the greenback since March 2009. The euro was also supported by Madrid's ability to sell five-year bonds following Moody's decision on Wednesday to put Spain's sovereign rating on review for a possible downgrade. "A successful Spanish bond auction and lower-than-expected demand for short-term loans from the European Central Bank alleviated liquidity concerns in the 16-member bloc and buoyed the euro," said Omer Esiner, chief market analyst at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange, Inc in Washington. The U.S. dollar fell to a seven-month low against the yen, trading down 0.87 percent to 87.62. Commodity-based currencies like the Australian dollar fell on expectations raw material demand will drop as growth slows. The Aussie dollar shed 0.45 percent to $0.8437. Oil fell for a fourth straight day, settling down $2.68, or 3.54 percent at $72.95 a barrel. Spot gold lost $42.60, or 3.43 percent, to $1,198.70, a one-month low. Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasuries ended the day down 2/32 of a point in price, with the yield at 2.94 percent. In early trade Treasuries rallied, driving yields to 14 month lows below 2.90 percent. In Europe, the 10-year Bund yield was at 2.565 percent, down 1.6 basis points.
