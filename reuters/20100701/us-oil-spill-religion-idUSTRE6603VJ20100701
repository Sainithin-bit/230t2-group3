 PORT SULPHUR, Louisiana  (Reuters) - Rev. Gerry Stapleton is not your average priest: he smokes, thinking nothing of lighting up inside his church, and peppers his brogue with a colorful vocabulary normally associated with a sailor. 

 The Roman Catholic priest's weekly sermons could be filled with tirades against BP, but they're not, as one of the worst oil spills in U.S. history puts many of his parishioners out of work. Yet Stapleton, 56, has been here before. After Hurricane Katrina literally washed his church away in Port Sulphur, La., he went on a global fund-raising drive to rebuild. Now, he is encouraging residents of southeastern Louisiana to have hope. "This is our home. We must not despair," said Stapleton, who joined the New Orleans Archdiocese more than 20 years ago from his native Ireland. "We put our businesses and lives back together after Katrina. We will do the same in this crisis." Seventy-three days into to the oil spill, many members of religious communities along the U.S. Gulf Coast report increased demand for their services as residents and responders look to make sense of the devastation and move forward. And in the deep South, part of the historical Bible Belt, various denominations are finding that they need to set aside doctrinal issues to help serve. Stapleton, pastor of St. Patrick Catholic Church, says many residents have sought counseling, angry at what happened and at what they viewed as a weak initial response to the gusher that has wreaked havoc on much of the Gulf Coast region's fisheries, tourism and wildlife. "Life is not easy, it is not fair," Stapleton said he tells them. "Every crisis gives up an opportunity to define who we are. Even if our government and BP abandon us, God will not abandon us." Stapleton and Rev. Dave Carlton, pastor at the Trinity United Methodist Church, hold services and counseling sessions at a BP spill response center in Venice, La., every Sunday. Though the service is sparsely attended, many - from day laborers to senior BP officials - are seeking private counseling, they said. 'BUILDING HOPE' "We talk about encouragement, building hope, getting through all of this," said Carlton, a portly man with a wide smile and white goatee. "The anger is there, but people know hope does not come out of anger." Carlton's church is sponsoring camps for area children whose parents are out of work and can't afford to pay for summer activities. The church is hiring counselors to work with children and help them deal with the spill's aftermath. Catholic Charities' New Orleans chapter holds weekly workshops for residents who need help filling out BP claims paperwork or to talk to a counselor. The group also is handing out $100 food vouchers for local grocery stores, courtesy of a $1 million check from BP, though funds are running out. "We don't want to get involved in the claims process, but we'll advocate for them," said Steve Lenahan, assistant director of Catholic Charities in New Orleans. "However, we desperately need volunteers, we need funding, and we need prayers." Sonia Mackey, who works on an oyster boat, says Catholic Charities' support has helped her survive, as the $2,500 claims check she receives each month from BP is not enough. "The people here at Catholic Charities are real nice," she said. "No matter what, I'm not giving up. I have faith in God." On a recent Sunday at Rev. Carlton's church in Buras, La., parishioners, many of whom work in the fishing or oil industries, ended their service with the hymn, "Trading My Sorrows." "I'm pressed, but not crushed, persecuted, not abandoned," the hymn read. "Struck down, but not destroyed." (Reporting by Ernest Scheyder, editing by Anna Driver and  Vicki Allen )
