 DETROIT  (Reuters) - General Motors Co GM.UL reported a 10.7 percent rise in June U.S. sales, helped by strong demand for newly launched vehicles such as the Chevrolet Equinox crossover and a recovery in truck sales. 

 The largest U.S. automaker sold 195,380 vehicles in June, up from 176,571 vehicles the same month a year ago. GM had filed for a U.S. government-funded bankruptcy on June 1, 2009. Sales for GM's four remaining brands -- Chevrolet, Buick, GMC and Cadillac -- jumped 36 percent from a year earlier to 194,828 vehicles. Sales of the brands GM has dropped through its bankruptcy restructuring -- Hummer, Pontiac, Saab and Saturn -- plunged by 98 percent to 552 vehicles as dealers sold off remaining inventory.
