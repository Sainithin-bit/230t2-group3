 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - German tourism and shipping company 
TUI ( TUIGn.DE ) is in talks to cooperate with Carnival ( CCL.L ) 
( CCL.N ), the world's largest cruise operator, a German 
newspaper reported. 

  In an article due to be published on Monday, Sueddeutsche 
Zeitung said that the cooperation would involve TUI running the 
European distribution of Carnival's AIDA business.  Talks were close to being finalized, the paper said, adding 
that TUI would present plans for the cooperation at its 
supervisory board meeting on Thursday.  A TUI spokesman declined to comment and referred to the 
supervisory board meeting.  At the meeting TUI will also address a series of 
cost-saving measures, which could include slashing thousands of 
jobs at its holiday business, mainly in Britain, to help reach 
its goals and a cut or push-back of its mid-term targets to 
double profits, sources close to the matter said.  Carnival has a fleet of 81 cruise ships and operates under 
a dozen brands including Carnival Cruise Lines in the United 
States, P&O Cruises in Britain and AIDA in Germany.
