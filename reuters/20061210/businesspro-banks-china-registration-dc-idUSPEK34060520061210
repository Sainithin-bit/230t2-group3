 BEIJING  (Reuters) - China's banking regulator said it had 
received eight applications from foreign banks for local 
registration, which it would begin processing on Monday, a 
first step in granting national treatment. 

  "The China Banking Regulatory Commission will examine the 
applications carefully and make appropriate determinations," 
the CBRC said in a statement on its Web site on Sunday.  The mainland issued new foreign bank guidelines on November 
16 to fulfill its obligations for entry into the World Trade 
Organization, which stipulates that the country must further 
open its banking sector to overseas competition from December 
11.  The new rules state that foreign banks seeking local 
incorporation must have paid-in capital of 1 billion yuan ($128 
million), a drop in the bucket for banks such as Citigroup Inc. 
( C.N ), the largest U.S. bank with a market value of $245 
billion.  Along with Citigroup, rivals HSBC ( HSBA.L ) ( 0005.HK ), 
Standard Chartered ( STAN.L ) ( 2888.HK ) and ABN AMRO AAH.AS are 
also known to have submitted applications.  Regulators will decide on the applications within six 
months, although they can extend the decision for another three 
months.  The foreign banks must have been open for business for at 
least three years and profitable for two years prior to the 
application, said the regulator.  If the applications are approved, the foreign banks will be 
allowed to engage in full-scale renminbi, or yuan, business, 
said the CBRC.  (US$=7.83 yuan)
