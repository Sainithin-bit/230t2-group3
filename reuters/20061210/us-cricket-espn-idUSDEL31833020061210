 MUMBAI  (Reuters) - ESPN-Star, a joint venture of Walt Disney Co. and News Corp., has won the broadcast rights to matches of the International Cricket Council, the governing body's Web site said. 

 The audio-visual rights for 18 ICC tournaments from late-2007 to 2015 were sold for an undisclosed sum "significantly in excess" of the ICC's previous commercial deal, ICC said. Local media reports estimated that the rights were sold for between $1 billion-$1.1 billion. The current holder, Sony Corp.'s Sony Entertainment Television, had won the rights for four years to the 2007 World Cup for an estimated $250 million. India's Zee Telefilms Ltd., Dubai's Taj Television -- which is now majority-owned by Zee -- and privately-held Nimbus Communications had also made bids. All the bids "were of a very high standard", ICC President Percy Sonn said in a statement. The 18 ICC tournaments will include two cricket World Cups, at least three Champions Trophy series and the first two Twenty20 world championships. ESPN-Star had lost its bid for broadcast rights to the powerful Indian board's matches, which were earlier this year awarded to Nimbus for four years for a sum of $612 million.
