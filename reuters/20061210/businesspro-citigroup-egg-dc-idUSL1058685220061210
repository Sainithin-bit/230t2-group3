 LONDON  (Reuters) - U.S. bank Citigroup Inc. ( C.N ) is 
considering a bid for British online bank Egg, which is owned 
by insurer Prudential Plc ( PRU.L ), the Sunday Times newspaper 
reported. 

  The paper said Citigroup may be prepared to pay more than 
950 million pounds ($1.9 billion) for Egg and that Prudential 
could use the proceeds to grow its business in Asia and its 
U.S. insurance unit Jackson National.  Prudential could not be reached immediately for comment.  Last December, Prudential offered to buy out minority 
shareholders, five years after floating a minority stake and a 
year after failing to sell the rest of Egg.  Prudential's bid initially valued Egg at 118 pence per 
share, but a rise in the insurer's share price increased the 
bid value to 135 pence by the time the deal completed in 
February, valuing Egg at about 1.1 billion pounds.
