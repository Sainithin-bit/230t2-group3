 RIYADH  (Reuters) - Saudi Electricity Co. 5110.SE said on 
Sunday it had awarded U.S. firm General Electric ( GE.N ) 
contracts worth 3.65 billion riyals ($973 million) to help 
expand three power plants in key regions of the country. 

  The project would increase the capacity of the three plants 
in the Eastern and Central provinces by 2,860 megawatts, Saudi 
Electricity, the kingdom's biggest utility by market value, 
said in a statement posted on a bourse Web site.  Completion is expected within 20 months, it added without 
giving further details.  The firm was forced to ration power for two weeks in August 
in the two provinces -- the kingdom's main industrial hubs -- 
due to technical failures.  Consumption peaks during the summer due to heavy reliance 
on air conditioning in the desert country.  The government promised financial aid to the firm in 
October to fund expansion to cope with the rising power demand.  Chief Executive Ali bin Saleh al-Barrak has said at least 
150 billion riyals in investment will be needed over the next 
10 years to cope with rising demand for electricity in the 
world's top oil-exporting country.  ($1=3.75 riyals)
