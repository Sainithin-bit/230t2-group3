 LONDON  (Reuters) - U.S. media company Gannett Co. Inc. 
( GCI.N ) is set to review its British newspaper unit, Newsquest, 
a move that could lead to its disposal for up to 1.5 billion 
pounds ($2.9 billion), the Sunday Express newspaper reported. 

  The paper said the review had been prompted by an 
increasingly tough market.  A Gannett spokeswoman could not immediately be reached for 
comment.  Newsquest publishes around 300 regional newspapers 
including 18 dailies, among them the Glasgow Herald.
