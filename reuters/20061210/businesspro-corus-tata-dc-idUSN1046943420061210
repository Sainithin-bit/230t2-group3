 LONDON  (Reuters) - India's Tata Steel ( TISC.BO ) raised a 
bid for Anglo-Dutch steelmaker Corus CS.L to an agreed 4.7 
billion pounds ($9.2 billion) on Sunday as it seeks to head off 
a potential counterbid from Brazil's CSN ( SID.N ). 

  The new offer, 500 pence per Corus share, is up from a 
previous cash bid of 455 pence, the two companies said.  It also trumps an indicative approach by Companhia 
Siderurgica Nacional (CSN) of 475 pence per share.  "The revised acquisition terms from Tata Steel are a 
substantial increase from the previous offer," Corus Chairman 
Jim Leng said in a joint statement.  "Accordingly, the Corus board are pleased to recommend this 
to Corus shareholders," he said.  Tata Steel Chairman Ratan Tata, for his part, was confident 
of his company's latest approach.  "We remain convinced of the compelling strategic rationale 
of this partnership and the revised terms deliver substantial 
additional value to Corus shareholders," he said.  Tata Steel won approval from Corus on October 20 for its 
initial offer to create the world's fifth-largest steelmaker. A 
successful bid would have been India's largest-ever foreign 
takeover.  CSN, however, remained in the picture. Sources familiar 
with the matter told Reuters last week that the company had 
completed due diligence on Corus Group but had yet to reach 
agreement with the steelmaker's pension trustees.  The Brazilian company said its proposal would also create a 
top-five steelmaker with an initial annual production capacity 
of 24 million metric tons. Output would surge to about 50 
million metric tons a year because of expansion projects 
already under way in Brazil.  The bids for Corus follows Mittal Steel's ( MT.N ) $32 
billion acquisition of rival Arcelor CELR.PA this year.
