 LONDON  (Reuters) - British insurer Prudential Plc ( PRU.L ) 
said on Sunday it had rejected an approach for its online bank 
Egg, after the Sunday Times newspaper reported that U.S. bank 
Citigroup Inc. ( C.N ) was considering a bid for Egg. 

  "It was clear that it was speculative and conditional and 
not in our shareholders' interests to pursue further. Our focus 
remains on our continuing review of the UK business and 
completing the integration of Egg," Prudential said in a 
statement which did not name the company making the approach.
