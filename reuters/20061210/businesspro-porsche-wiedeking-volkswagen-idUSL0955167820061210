 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - German sports car maker Porsche's 
( PSHG_p.DE ) stake of almost 30 percent in Volkswagen ( VOWG.DE ) 
is enough to assert its interests in Europe's biggest carmaker, 
Porsche's chief executive told a German newspaper. 

  "Given the low attendance at German annual meetings, there 
is not necessarily a need to hold 50 percent," Porsche CEO 
Wendelin Wiedeking said in an interview with Germany's Welt am 
Sonntag.  Porsche announced on November 15 that it had increased its 
stake in VW to 27.4 percent and intended to take it to 29.9 
percent, just below the 30 percent level that would force it to 
make a full takeover offer under German law.  It has in the past ruled out making a full bid for VW.  The so-called Volkswagen law prevents any individual 
shareholder from exercising more than 20 percent of VW's voting 
rights, regardless of the size of the stake. It was put in 
place after the state privatized Volkswagen in 1960 in order to 
prevent a takeover.  The European Commission is suing Germany over the VW Law, 
claiming it prevents the free flow of capital. On Tuesday the 
Commission will challenge the law at the European Court of 
Justice hearing.  "The law is not up-to-date anymore. It needs to be 
abolished, and we will stand up for this," Wiedeking said in 
the interview.  Porsche, owned by the family of VW Chairman Ferdinand 
Piech, sparked speculation of a full takeover by proposing in 
November to create authorized capital equal to half its share 
capital -- and worth around 8 billion euros ($10.6 billion) -- 
at a shareholders' meeting in January.
