 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The International Monetary Fund will meet on Friday to discuss the next round of aid to Greece, the Fund's new managing director Christine Lagarde told reporters on Wednesday. 

 "There is an IMF board meeting which is scheduled for Friday at which we shall consider the fourth review and eventually the payment of the fifth tranche that falls due," the former French finance minister said. (Reporting by  Pedro Nicolaci da Costa ; Editing by  James Dalgleish )
