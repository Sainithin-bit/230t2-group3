 LONDON  (Reuters) - Car makers Ford, Vauxhall and Mitsubishi Motors, along with Britain's biggest high street lender Lloyds and billionaire Richard Branson's Virgin Holidays, are among firms to have dropped advertising in the News of the World newspaper due to allegations of hacking. 

 Following are comments from advertisers, many responding to a barrage of messages on Twitter from consumers, politicians and celebrities calling for boycotts of News of the World and other UK titles belonging to Rupert Murdoch including The Sun and The Times. Bourne Leisure (Butlins, Haven Holidays, Warner Leisure) - "We review all our sources of advertising regularly and we will not be advertising in NoW (News of the World)." Coca-Cola - "We have no advertising currently running with the News of the World and none scheduled for the future. We are shocked by the new allegations that have been made." The Co-operative Group - "The Co-operative Group has taken the decision to suspend temporarily any further advertising and promotional activity with the News of the World until the outcome of the investigation is known. The Group is a consumer-owned business which adheres to strong ethical standards. These allegations have been met with revulsion by the vast majority of members who have contacted us." Dixons (Currys and PC World): "There are a number of factors that determine our media planning and we constantly review all the media we use. However, we do not comment on specific cases."

We will actively monitor the situation and await the outcome of any investigation." Ford - "We are awaiting an outcome from the News of the World investigation and expect a speedy and decisive response. Pending this response we will be using alternative media within and outside News International Group instead of placing Ford advertising in the News of the World."

This was a tactical decision in the short term whilst we carefully consider our longer term position and its implications." Marks & Spencer - "M&S does not advertise with the NOTW. We do advertise with other News International titles, such as The Sun, The Times and The Sunday Times and will be monitoring the situation closely to see how it develops." McDonald's - Says it has not advertised in the News of the World since 2010 and has no plans to do so. It will continue to advertise in The Sun. Mitsubishi Motors Corp - "Mitsubishi Motors in the UK considers this type of activity- especially in such a distressing case- to be unbelievable, unspeakable and despicable.

Morrisons - "We won't be changing our advertising policy." nPower - "We are suspending our current advertising with the News of the World and we will review our options going forward."
