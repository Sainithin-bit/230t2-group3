 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia has offered more crude to some Asian buyers for August on top of contractual volumes, an industry source said on Wednesday. 

 This marks the second month that top oil exporter Saudi Aramco has made such an offer, after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries failed to make a decision on raising output last month. (Reporting by Osamu Tsukimori; Editing by  Chris Gallagher )
