 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Christine Varney, the top antitrust official in the U.S. Justice Department, is stepping down to become a partner at an elite law firm in New York. 

 The law firm, Cravath, Swaine & Moore, made the announcement in an internal memo on Wednesday. Although Varney was appointed by President Obama to beef up antitrust enforcement, she was not considered the hard-nosed enforcer many had expected. She cleared major deals during her two years on the job, including the approval of Comcast Corp's ( CMCSA.O ) acquisition of a 51 percent stake in NBC Universal from General Electric Co. ( GE.N ), creating a $30 billion business that includes broadcast, cable networks, movie studios and theme parks. The deal included the condition that Comcast give up day-to-day control of the video website Hulu. The Justice Department under Varney also extended controversial approvals of Ticketmaster's buy of Live Nation in 2010 and Google's ( GOOG.O ) purchase of ticketing software company ITA in April. The Justice Department did not immediately respond to request for comment about Varney's departure. Cravath, a law firm with about 500 attorneys, has a renowned antitrust practice. It represented United Airlines ( UAL.N ) in its merger with Continental, a merger that was completed in October. The firm also has long-represented IBM and Time Warner Cable. The law firm's average profits per partner in 2010 were $3.2 million, according to the American Lawyer. Gross revenue was $591 million. Prior to becoming Assistant Attorney General for the Antitrust Division, Varney practiced for 10 years at Hogan & Hartson, now Hogan Lovells. She was previously a commissioner at the Federal Trade Commission. (Reporting by Alison Frankel, Leigh Jones, Erin Geiger Smith and  Karey Wutkowski ; Editing by  Eddie Evans )
