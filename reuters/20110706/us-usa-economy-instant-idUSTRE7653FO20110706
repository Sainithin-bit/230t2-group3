 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. service sector growth was slowed modestly in May, with new orders slipping, the Institute for Supply Management said on Wednesday. 

 COMMENTS: DAVID ADER, HEAD OF GOVERNMENT BOND STRATEGY, CRT CAPITAL GROUP, STAMFORD, CONNECTICUT: "A somewhat friendly number, though not falling off the cliff, so consistent with some growth in June so clearly softer that we seen in prior months. Note the steady Employment Index. Challenger layoffs earlier were up quite a bit and so skew to a small uptick" in unemployment. DAVID KEEBLE, GLOBAL HEAD OF INTEREST RATES STRATEGY, CREDIT AGRICOLE CORPORATE & INVESTMENT BANK, NEW YORK "It's mildly supportive for bonds. It's a bit below expectations. Last month we saw a bounce, but it didn't continue. This is not a game-changer. There are too much other things going on." PIERRE ELLIS, SENIOR ECONOMIST, DECISION ECONOMICS, NEW YORK: "The index was softer than last month and a little softer than expectations. The question is whether this is significant or just normal volatility. The setback in new orders was bad news, but there's a reassuring indication of confidence in the firming of the employment index. Export orders were also very solid at high levels. This is probably just normal up and down rather than evidence of new deterioration."
