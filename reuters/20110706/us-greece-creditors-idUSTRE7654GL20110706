 LONDON  (Reuters) - Banks and other creditors are considering a "menu of options" as they attempt to put forward a private sector contribution to help Greece, and are not focusing on fine-tuning one particular proposal, the head of the bank lobby group said. 

 The Institute of International Finance (IIF) hosted a "productive" meeting of private-sector creditors in Paris on Wednesday, IIF Managing Director Charles Dallara told Reuters in a telephone interview. "We are looking at a menu of options to help Greece. We did not spend a great deal of time today trying to refine any particular option," he said. Dallara said among the options being considered are debt buy-backs that could provide longer-term sustainable help, in addition to measures such as a debt rollover plan that would help short-term financing needs.
