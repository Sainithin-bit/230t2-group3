 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Portugal's credit downgrade pressured the euro and global stocks on Wednesday and China's rate hike weighed on commodities, but Wall Street paid little heed and pushed shares higher. 

 Moody's downgrade of Portugal cast new doubt on European efforts to rescue distressed euro zone states without debt restructuring. The 19-commodity Reuters-Jefferies CRB index .CRB settled down almost half a percent and U.S. crude oil, the CRB's main component, fell a quarter percent. But gold, a safe haven, rose 1 percent. U.S. stocks ended up, rebounding from a weak open. Transportation shares were among the standouts in a session in which volume was contained by falling bank stocks. .N "Any time you are dealing with banking issues, there seems to be a domino effect," said Steve Goldman, market strategist at Weeden & Co. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  settled up 56.15 points, or 0.45 percent, at 12,626.02. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  rose 1.34 points, or 0.10 percent, at 1,339.22. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  ended up 8.25 points, or 0.29 percent, at 2,834.02. The Dow Transports index .DJT hit an unofficial all-time closing high at 5,565.90. "There's new momentum in the market following last week's surge, and generally speaking, the markets have an upward bias," said Michael McGervey, president of McGervey Wealth Management in North Canton, Ohio. "But until we break through 1,345 (on the S&P 500), we'll be trading sideways," he said, adding that there was further upside potential if the level was breached. The euro fell 0.7 percent on the day after touching a one-week low below $1.43 and extending losses from Tuesday. Its losses versus the dollar boosted the greenback 0.5 percent against a currency basket. The euro's fall came as fears over Greece and Portugal prompt investors to hunt for safer havens such as the Swiss franc and yen. "Maybe we want a quick fix, maybe we are looking for one, but there is no quick fix and if there is, I haven't heard it yet," said Frank Lesh, a futures analyst and broker at FuturePath Trading LLC in Chicago. Some investors were also shedding risky assets ahead of the European Central Bank's monetary policy announcement on Thursday. The ECB is all but guaranteed to raise interest rates by 25 basis points to 1.5 percent -- an encouraging development for the euro -- although markets remain uncertain on the timing of further rate moves by the central bank. The two-year yield on Portuguese government debt surged more than 2 percentage points to a lifetime high of 15.77 percent, while the 10-year yield climbed more than 1 percentage point to 13.45 percent, also its highest ever. The MSCI world equity index .MIWD00000PUS, which tracks global equities, and the FTSEurofirst 300 index  .FTEU3  for European shares both closed down 0.3 percent. Markets showed little reaction to U.S. data on the service sector reflecting a slight slowdown in growth in June, according to the Institute for Supply Management. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note was up 5/32, its yield at 3.1006 percent.
