 SHANGHAI  (Reuters) - Air France-KLM, Europe's largest airline by revenue, aims for at least 20 percent growth in sales in China each year, a senior executive said on Wednesday. 

 "We aim for 20 percent minimum growth each year," Marnix H. Fruitema, the firm's senior vice president of Asia Pacific, told Reuters on the sidelines of an industry conference. Air France-KLM flies to eight destinations in China. (Reporting by  Melanie Lee ; Editing by Jacqueline Wong)
